        This Charm is often one of the first that young
        Lunars learn. It allows the Lunar to suppress his tattoos,
        causing them to become invisible. The effects of this
        Charm dissipate if the Lunar's Tell becomes visible due
        to his anima banner reaching or exceeding the 4-7
        motes level of anima display. Otherwise, it is impossible
        to detect the Lunar's tattoos â€” even forms of sight that
        allow the perception of active Essence will not see the
        effects of the Charm. Storytellers should assume that
        individuals who see a Lunar with unsuppressed tattoos
        will always regard the Lunar suspiciously for the purposes
        of perceiving his Tell, and most will immediately
        realize the character's nature. The Lunar Anathema
        are, after all, the stuff of legend.

        This Charm makes it harder to perceive the
        Lunar's Tell. While this Charm is active, it is impossible
        to detect the Tell of a Lunar who has never
        purchased Deadly Beastman Transformation. While
        this Charm is active, Lunars who have purchased
        Deadly Beastman Transformation 1-2 times are treated
        as if they had never purchased it for the purposes of
        having their Tells spotted. Lunars who have pur-
        chased Deadly Beastman Transformation 3 or more
        times are treated as if they purchased it 1-2 times for
        the purposes of spotting their Tells. This Charm
        cannot suppress the character's Tell at the 4-7 motes
        level of anima banner display, and its effects end if the
        character's anima becomes that intense.

        &lt;br&gt;
        When purchasing this Charm, the Lunar chooses an
        animal no larger than an elk and no smaller than a large
        cat. That animal is now the Lunar's spirit animal, and its
        shape is now considered one of the Lunar's true shapes.
        It is thus easier to spot the Lunar's Tell when she assumes
        this animal shape, and if the Lunar becomes locked into
        her true shapes, she can still use this Charm to change
        between her human and totem animal shape.&lt;br&gt;
        Almost all Lunars know this Charm. A Lunar either
        tastes the heart's blood of his totem animal during his
        initiation or, in many cases, finds the totem-shape when
        she Exalts. Such Exalts are driven by an incredible
        craving to consume the life of a beast of their newfound
        shape, so that they can fairly gain its form. If a Lunar
        wants a totem animal larger than an elk or smaller than
        a cat, she may gain one, but she must already know or
        must immediately purchase Humble Mouse Shape or
        Towering Beast Form as appropriate and cannot exceed
        the limits of those Charms.&lt;br&gt;
        A Lunar may change his totem animal, but doing so
        is both costly and dangerous. Those who choose to do so
        must pay a dot of permanent Willpower and buy this
        Charm again. Traces of his previous form remain in the
        Lunar's Tell, to which may be added attributes of the new
        form. A Lunar whose Tell combines the traits of several
        animals is known by other Lunars as a chimera and is
        regarded with scorn. In addition, the Lunar may offend
        the animal avatar of the species he forsakes and, thus,
        gain the enmity of that godly being and the species it
        protects. A Lunar in his totem animal shape may spend
        1 mote to activate this Charm and return to human
        shape. This Charm may be activated only once per turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Members of the Eclipse Caste may not learn this
        Charm, for it draws on a natural power of the Lunar
        Exalted that Solars cannot master or emulate.

        Shaping the Ideal Form&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Manipulation: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Finding the Spirit's Shape&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the Lunar to make minor
        cosmetic changes to the appearance of any of his true
        forms. Such modifications include changing hair, eye
        or skin color by several shades, lengthening (or shortening)
        hair length, reshaping a chin or nose slightly or
        straightening teeth. A modification only applies to
        the form in which it was used â€” if the Lunar wishes to
        alter is hair color in his human and totem-animal
        shapes, he will have to use this Charm twice. Shaping
        the Ideal Form does not allow the Lunar to assume the
        appearance of another being, though it may help to
        disguise his appearance. Lunars who wish to assume
        the form of specific individuals must learn the Charm
        Prey's Skin Disguise. Shaping the Ideal Form cannot
        be used to conceal the Lunar's Tell or tattoos. No
        matter how much effort is put into the shaping, the
        Charm cannot be used to improve the Lunar's Physical
        Attributes unless the player invests experience in
        raising the Attribute â€” in that case, training time can
        represent an extended campaign of cosmetic self-
        improvement by reshaping. Overuse of the Charm
        tends to detract from the Lunar's appearance, render-
        ing him bland. It is regarded as a sign of degeneracy and
        vanity among Luna's Beloved.

        Deadly Beastman Transformation&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;

        Minimum Charisma: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Finding the Spirit's Shape&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This powerful Charm allows the Lunar to shift its
        shape into a monstrous hybrid of the human form and its
        totem animal. This shape is three feet taller than the
        Lunar's normal height and enjoys many bonuses. Anyone
        who sees the Lunar in this shape cannot fail to
        mistake him for what he is â€” a sleek and deadly feral
        killing machine. A character using this shapechanging
        Charm is considered to be in one of his true forms, which
        includes the increased visibility of his Tell.&lt;br&gt;
        The first time a character takes this Charm, he
        receives five Attribute points and two gifts. Both Attribute
        points and gifts must be applied immediately after
        the character purchases this Charm. Subsequent purchases
        of the Charm provide three Attribute points and
        one gift per purchase. A character can purchase this
        Charm no more times than he has points of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        Each Attribute point represents the war-shape's
        enhanced physical capabilities. One Attribute point
        raises the character's Strength or Stamina by 1 while he
        is in his beastman form, and two Attribute points can
        raise the character's beastman form's Dexterity by 1.
        Once allocated, these bonuses are fixed and cannot be
        modified. These points must be allocated immediately
        when the Charm is purchased - characters cannot save
        up points between purchases of this Charm. When the
        character is in his hybrid war-shape, these bonus Attributes
        are considered to be a natural part of the
        character's Attribute for the purposes of Charms that
        double Attributes and for the purposes of Charms that
        allow the character to convert Attribute dice to auto-
        matic successes on a roll.&lt;br&gt;
        Gifts represent special capabilities the hybrid shape
        offers and give the character some sort of special bonus
        beyond increased Attributes. Gifts often have prerequisite
        gifts, which their effects build on and enhance. A
        character cannot take a gift without taking all of its
        prerequisites. Characters cannot take a gift more than
        once unless the gift specifically permits it. Gifts, like
        the Attribute bonuses, apply only while in hybrid form.
        If the Lunar wishes to take advantage of his gifts in
        human or totem animal form, he must learn Charms
        that have similar effects or else use the Charm Calling
        Luna's Favor.&lt;br&gt;
        In beastman form, weapons and armor worn by the
        Lunar in human form are present in hybrid form as well,
        magically adjusted to suit the size of the hybrid form.
        While the Lunar's adjusted Attributes might allow him
        to wield huge weapons or bear the weight of superheavy
        armor, this Charm does not turn the Lunar's accoutrements
        into such gear. Though the weapons may change
        somewhat in size and shape to accommodate the hybrid's
        large grip, the weapons' and armor's statistics do not
        alter. Defensive gifts (Rugged Hide, Impenetrable Beast-Armor)
        combine with any armor worn by the Lunar.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters can gain large dice pools by means of
        the Deadly Beastman Transformation. Keep in mind
        that the Lunar's running speed, jumping distance and
        lifting ability will likewise change. Players should remember
        that they may use the automatic successes rules
        (Exalted, p. 90-91) rather than rolling dice for many
        Athletics feats.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters in their hybrid shape may spend 5
        motes activate this Charm and assume human form.
        This Charm can be used only once per turn. Because
        assuming totem animal shape with Finding the Spirit's
        Shape requires only 1 mote of Essence and the Lunar
        can then change to human shape with another activation
        of that Charm, it is significantly cheaper for a
        Lunar to pass through animal shape when returning to
        human form (2 motes versus 5). However, this takes an
        extra turn, so Lunars in a hurry sometimes directly
        return to human shape.&lt;br&gt;
        Members of the Eclipse Caste may not learn this
        Charm, for it draws on a natural power of the Lunar
        Exalted that Solars cannot master or emulate.

        From immediately after the character activates this Charm
        until the end of the scene or until the character ends the
        Charm's effects, he enjoys the benefits of one of his
        Deadly Beastman Transformation gifts. The gift actually
        manifests and is probably an obvious mark of supernatural
        character. Characters can manifest any gift they
        possess, regardless of whether or not it has prerequisites.

        Beastman Transformation gift until he ends the
        Charm's effects or he next enters hybrid form. As with
        Calling Luna's Favor, above, the gift actually manifests
        and is in no way concealed by this magic.

        then allows her to assume the victim's outward appearance
        and Physical Attributes and Appearance, but she
        does not gain the victim's knowledge, Mental or Social
        Attributes or Abilities. If the target is an Exalt, the Lunar
        gains his outward appearance but remains a Lunar. This
        Charm cannot be used to mimic the Fair Folk who,
        though humanoid, are something other.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can still dress and act any way she
        desires â€” she adopts the victim's outward appearance,
        not personality. A Lunar willing to consume many mor-
        tals can develop quite a diverse catalog of shapes. Just as
        with any other type of shapechanging, the appearance of
        the character's Tell and tattoos is unchanged. Lunars who
        wish to masquerade as the persons they consumed would
        thus be well-advised to use Charms to suppress these
        unmistakable signs. The Charm's effect includes a gender
        change if appropriate, with the same limitations to preg-
        nant characters as Many-Faced Moon Transformation.&lt;br&gt;
        Members of the Eclipse Caste may not learn this
        Charm, for it draws on a natural power of the Lunar
        Exalted that Solars cannot master or emulate.

        Prerequisite Charms: Shaping the Ideal Form&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        By allowing a subject to taste his blood and activating
        this Charm, the Lunar can make minor
        alterations to the form of another willing subject. The
        range of possible changes are as per Shaping the Ideal
        Form - this Charm cannot be used to change a
        target's shape or to give her the appearance of a specific
        other human. Unlike modifications the Lunar makes
        to himself, the changes fade after a day. The subject
        must also spend a temporary Willpower point (two if
        she is an Exalt). Unwilling subjects, tattooed Lunars,
        non-humans, the undead and unmaterialized spirits
        cannot be shaped by this Charm. Once the Charm is
        activated, the player rolls Manipulation + Craft
        (Body Shaping) at standard difficulty. One
        success or more indicates success, while if
        the roll fails, the subject's form is unaltered.
        A botch, however, results in an unexpected
        â€” and usually unpleasant - outcome.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A more powerful version of the Lunar
        Blood Reshaping Technique, this Charm
        allows the Lunar to alter the subject's form to
        match one of the patterns in the Lunar's
        &amp;quot;library.&amp;quot; This process is a difficult one, both
        painful for the subject and requiring immense skill
        by the Lunar, but it allows the subject to attain a non-human
        form or to masquerade as another human. In
        addition to the costs to the Lunar, the subject must
        spend 2 temporary Willpower points (3 if an Exalt).
        Unwilling subjects, tattooed Lunars, non-humans, the
        undead and unmaterialized spirits cannot be shaped
        by this Charm. Once the Charm is activated, the
        Lunar's player rolls Manipulation + Craft (Body
        Shaping) at difficulty 3. Three or more suc-
        cesses indicates success, while if the roll fails (or
        gets only one or two successes), the subject's
        form is unaltered. A botch, however, results in
        an unexpected â€” and usually unpleasant â€”
        outcome, probably a subject twisted and
        crippled for the duration or possibly suffering
        permanent damage.

        Prerequisite Charms: Lunar Blood Reshaping Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can reshape inert
        once-living material into another form. He can turn a
        fallen tree into a shelter, a bone into a weapon or a hide
        into clothing. He cannot, however, use the Charm to
        create complex objects (a simple buckle is about as
        sophisticated as it gets), nor can it be used to reshape
        objects that are already under the influence of Charms,
        sorcery or other supernatural effects. The item to be
        shaped must be smeared in the Lunar's blood, costing
        him a single health level (unsoakable lethal damage)
        before Essence can be channeled into the object.&lt;br&gt;
        The texture, appearance and so on of the original
        material remains unaltered â€” a bone weapon is clearly
        bone, not metal â€” but the product may be modified by
        conventional methods (dyes, paint and so forth). The
        Essence cost for activating the Charm reflects the amount
        of raw material affected. If the target object is roughly the
        same size as the raw material, the Essence cost of the
        Charm is unaltered. If a size change is part of the process,
        the Lunar must spend additional Essence motes, each
        extra mote allowing the final product's size to be twice
        (or half) that of the raw material. An object fashioned in
        this manner are not permanent, but rather remains while
        the Lunar commits the Essence. If the Lunar uses the
        Essence for other purposes, the object reverts to its
        original form. A Lunar can, however, make his construct
        permanent by spending a point of Willpower, but this
        may only be done at the moment of creation. In this case,
        the Charm is instant, and the Essence returns normally.&lt;br&gt;
        Shaping the object requires a Manipulation + Craft
        roll, usually of difficulty 1. The Storyteller may, however,
        increase this difficulty for more complex shapes.
        This Charm cannot effect the undead.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar transforms his limbs to
        enhance his swimming abilities, turning his limbs into
        flippers, webbing hands and feet or performing other
        similar effects (at the Lunar's discretion) to enhance his
        swimming abilities, allowing him to move through water
        unimpeded at twice his normal movement rate. If the
        Lunar is in a form with innate swimming abilities, such
        as that of a shark or a seal, the Fish Tail Technique
        confers no additional benefits. This Charm does not
        confer the ability to breath water, and the character must
        surface to breathe (per the holding breath rules on p. 243
        of Exalted) or risk drowning.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Most Lunars abhor the trappings of civilization, but
        this does not mean that they don't occasionally require
        tools. Unlike mortals, who must keep a range of prefabricated
        tools for such circumstances, a Lunar can reshape
        his body to provide the necessary instruments. Hands
        are strengthened and fingers and claws sharpened and
        reshaped to provide any tool the Exalt might need.
        While using the Tool-Hand Technique, the Lunar can
        naturally perform tasks that would normally require
        tools (for example, boring a hole in wood, hammering a
        peg or picking at stone). The Lunar's hands, feet or
        whatever else is shaped into the tool takes on a superficial
        resemblance to the tool in question but remains
        indisputably flesh and bone (albeit flesh and bone
        surrounded by a nimbus of Essence). A Lunar with
        multiple limbs can equip the multiple limbs at a cost of
        1 mote per limb and suffers no injury from the pounding.
        cutting or rasping of using the &amp;quot;tools.&amp;quot; The Tool-Hand
        Technique cannot be used to form weapons or to otherwise
        give the Lunar an advantage in inflicting or
        withstanding damage, nor does the Lunar work any
        faster than she would with normal tools. Any rolls
        involving Craft gain +2 dice when the Lunar uses this
        Charm.

        By means of this Charm, the Lunar's bones, muscles
        and organs become capable of immense deformation, allowing
        him to squeeze his body through gaps it would not
        normally fit through. By means of this Charm, a human-sized
        Lunar could wriggle through a hole as small as a mouse
        hole or a knothole in a fence. The process is very unsettling
        to watch and is likewise uncomfortable for the Lunar.&lt;br&gt;
        The Rat-Head Technique cannot be used as part of
        any Combo or while the Lunar is under the effects of a
        Charm or sorcery that hardens or reinforces his limbs in
        any manner (such as the Body Weapon Technique). While
        using this Charm, the Lunar's natural soak cannot exceed
        2B/2L under any circumstances, and he cannot parry lethal
        attacks without an appropriate stunt â€” his &amp;quot;softened&amp;quot; body
        lacks the strength to do so effectively. A Lunar under the
        effect of Rat-Head Technique may dodge normally.

            Lunars employ Essence to enhance their muscles via
            this Charm, using a series of stances and static exercises
            to focus Essence into their limbs, increasing their strength
            and resilience. A Lunar using this Charm swells into an
            intimidating, muscular brute. Her tendons stand out like
            taught rope, and her muscles seem ready to burst through
            her skin. The Exalt's player makes a Strength + Athletics
            roll. For every success, add one to the Lunar's Strength.
            That character cannot more than double her initial
            Strength through the use of this Charm. This is a dice
            bonus added by a Charm and should be considered as

            the Crouching Tiger Exercise require the character's
            undivided dice action for a number of turns equal to 10
            + (the Lunar's Strength prior to this performance of the
            exercise). These turns of preparation must be concurrent
            and uninterrupted and cannot be combined with the
            preparation periods of other, similar exercises.

            By performing a series of limbering up exercises and

            Lunar Exalt can temporarily boost his hand-eye coordination,

            Using this Charm, the Lunar gains preternatural
            balance beyond that of even the greatest feline hunter.
            The Exalt can walk across surfaces as fragile as bamboo
            and string with ease and casually resists efforts to unbalance
            him. By spending motes of Essence, the Lunar's
            player may convert Dexterity dice into automatic successes
            when making a single Athletics roll related to
            balance and climbing or when rolling to resist or escape
            sweeps, clinches, holds and tackles. Upon activating the
            Charm, the Lunar's body and features undergo subtle
            changes, resulting in a lithe and graceful appearance that
            shifts to give him the best balance and grip possible in the
            present circumstances.

            Using this Charm, the Lunar's legs shift into the
            likeness of the legs of a giant cat, and his whole body
            twists slightly, becoming lower and more streamlined.
            For the remainder of the scene, the character can move
            at twice his normal movement rate and leap three times
            his normal jumping distance. If the target surface is
            uncertain, the Lunar's player must still make a (Dexterity
            or Wits) + Athletics roll normally for the character to
            land successfully (see p. 252 of Exalted) after such a leap.
            A Lunar may carry a &amp;quot;passenger&amp;quot; on such a leap, though
            doing so reduces his effective Dexterity by one and his
            effective Strength by two. A Full Moon who uses this
            Charm in conjunction with his anima power moves at
            three times his normal movement rate and can leap five
            times his normal jumping distance.

            &lt;br&gt;
            By creating a flap of skin between his arms and legs,
            a Lunar can drastically extend his leaping abilities.
            Using the skin flap as crude gliding wings, a Lunar using
            this technique can extend his horizontal leaping abilities
            in excess of 10 times his normal leaping distance, though
            this depends on his trading height for distance. He can
            travel 20 yards per dot of Strength and Athletics, and
            another two yards for every yard of altitude he descends.
            For example, a Lunar with Strength 3, Athletics 3 who
            leaps from a branch 100 yards up may glide to a point on
            the ground 320 yards away ([3 x 20] + [3 x 20] + [2 Ã— 100]
            yards). The Lunar may attempt to extend this distance
            by rolling Dexterity + Athletics, each success adding 10
            percent to the range. The anima powers of a Full Moon
            Lunar, the effect of Panther Stride Stance and other
            movement-enhancing Charms do not add to the gliding
            distance of the Skin-Flap Flying Method.

            Using this Charm, a Lunar greatly improves his
            ability to avoid damage from a fall. He will always land
            on his feet and suffers only one level of bashing damage
            for every 10 feet fallen. Furthermore, he only suffers
            lethal damage if he falls more than 100 feet or onto a
            treacherous surface such as spikes.

            &lt;br&gt;
            Using his protean abilities to grow claws and to
            adapt his skeleton and muscles, a Lunar Exalted can
            ascend trees (or other surfaces where his claws can
            grip) with surprising ease. The Lunar normally uses
            half his movement rate when climbing but may use his
            full movement rate without penalty if his player makes
            a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll. When faced
            with difficult climbing conditions (high winds, overhangs,
            etc.) a Lunar using this Charm reduces the
            difficulty of the Dexterity + Athletics roll by l (but not
            below 1). If the Lunar makes unarmed Brawl or Martial
            Arts attacks while the Charm is active, his attacks
            inflict lethal damage.

            Using this Charm, a Lunar may ascend, descend or
            traverse any surface with relative ease, even if there are
            no obvious handholds. Instead, he relies on minute
            adjustments to his fingers and toes to exploit minute
            variations in surface texture. The Lunar may move up to
            half his normal movement rate either horizontally or
            vertically and reduces the difficulty of all Dexterity +
            Athletics rolls by 2 (but not below 1). Lunar characters
            may carry up to 100 pounds per point of Strength while
            using this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A Lunar may use this Charm to enhance his unarmed-combat
        abilities, making his blows more deadly
        by focusing Essence into his limbs. Rather than inflicting
        bashing damage when executing a single unarmed Brawl
        or Martial Arts attack (not a wrestling maneuver), his
        blow causes lethal damage.

        The Lunar uses the Sinuous Striking Grace Charm
        to guide his actions, allowing Essence flows to suggest the
        likely actions of allies and enemies alike. When rolling
        initiative, the Lunar may spend motes of Essence to
        improve his initiative rating, 1 mote buying a +1 modifier
        to a maximum of the Lunar's Dexterity score.

        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can instinctively
        perceive the flows of Essence in his target, using the
        victim's intentions to easily guide the Exalt's blows
        through the enemy's defenses, making the Lunar's claws
        and teeth incredibly accurate. For each mote of Essence
        spent on this Charm, the Lunar gains an additional
        attack die on a single unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack. These bonus dice may not exceed the character's
        Dexterity.

        A skilled Lunar can use Essence to enhance his
        reactions, giving him preternatural reflexes and allowing
        him to attack multiple times in a turn. For every 3 motes
        of Essence spent activating this Charm, the Lunar gains
        an additional unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack. A
        Lunar can buy no more extra actions than his permanent
        Essence, nor more than (the initiative on which he
        activated this Charm + 3, rounded down). This normally
        means (the character's initiative + 3), but Lunars who
        hold their action and then invoke this Charm may lose
        their ability to make many extra actions.

        Prerequisite Charms: Sinuous Striking Grace&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        By utilizing the sinuous movements of a snake, the
        Lunar can use a civilized enemy's strengths against him.
        When attacked by a Melee or Martial Arts attack but
        before damage is rolled, the Exalt's player can make a
        reflexive Dexterity + Dodge roll against a difficulty equal
        to the number of successes rolled on the attack. If the roll
        succeeds, any damage from the attack is applied to the
        attacker instead of the Lunar, with extra successes by the
        Lunar increasing the number of damage dice. Even if the
        Exalt fails to reflect the attack, Lunar's successes on the
        Dexterity + Dodge roll still reduce the attack's successes
        normally. The Snake Body Technique is a form of dodge
        and cannot be used against undodgeable attacks, nor can
        it be used to avoid counterattack-type effects.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By holding his body in anticipation of the opponent's
        actions, a Lunar using this Charm can ready a devastating
        blow against his foe, timing that blow with deadly
        precision. The Lunar activates the Charm before rolling
        initiative and chooses a self-inflicted initiative penalty.
        For every point of penalty on the initiative roll, the
        Lunar gains a bonus die to his attack roll. This bonus
        cannot exceed the Lunar's Dexterity, counts against the
        Exalted's Dexterity Charm dice and only applies during
        turns when the character plans to make Brawl or Martial
        Arts attacks. If the Lunar does not attack in the turn in
        which the Charm is activated, the advantages of the
        Coiled Cobra Stance are lost. If the Lunar full dodges or
        aborts to a parry, the effects of the Charm are lost. Coiled
        Cobra Stance cannot be used in a Combo with Charms
        that grant extra actions. A character cannot split his dice
        pool in a turn when he uses the Coiled Cobra Stance.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: After the first turn of combat, Kajeha
        Lef knows she is faster than her opponent does and opts
        to use the Coiled Cobra Stance. Kajeha is in hybrid form
        and has a Dexterity of 6 but opts to delay her initiative
        by only 5 points rather than risk the opponent acting
        first. In the second turn of combat, her initiative score is
        14 (reduced to 9), while her opponent gets a 7 total.
        Kajeha still acts first, but her use of the Coiled Cobra
        Stance adds 5 dice to her attack pool.

        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Dexterity: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Body Weapon Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the Lunar to harness his bestial
        prowess to become a killing machine. He becomes instinctively
        aware of an opponent's weak spots and how to
        exploit them, allowing him to target his attacks to
        maximum effect. He may spend Essence to turn his
        Dexterity dice into automatic successes when making a
        single unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack. The dice
        converted into automatic successes are not rolled as part
        of his dice pool but the remaining dice (including Ability
        dice and any Attribute dice not converted to successes)
        are rolled normally. Each Attribute die converted costs
        2 motes of Essence. The precision of the Deadly Claw
        Blow allows the Lunar to harm beings not wholly in the
        material world, allowing him to target spirits even if they
        are dematerialized.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Swims in Shadows uses Deadly Claw
        Blow to enhance his abilities in combat with the Fair Folk. His
        player spends 6 motes of Swims in Shadows' Essence to
        convert his 3 Dexterity dice into automatic successes, then
        rolls the four dice of his Brawl Ability to see if he can increase
        this number. He rolls 3, 4, 8 and 1, adding one additional
        success, for a total of four successes.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this technique, the Lunar temporarily trans-
        forms his claws and fangs into moonsilver, drastically
        improving his combat abilities. When using the Charm,
        the Lunar may make unarmed claw attacks with his Brawl
        or Martial Arts at Spd +6, Acc +1, Dmg +3L, Pry +1. He
        may make unarmed bite attacks with those Abilities at
        Spd +0, Acc + 2, Dmg +5L, Pry +0. Claws of the Silver
        Moon can harm spirits even if they are dematerialized
        and Charms that enhance moonsilver weapons may be
        used in conjunction with Claws of the Silver Moon.

        but he also enlarges and reshapes them into vicious rending
        weapons, well capable of disemboweling an ill-prepared
        foe. When using the Charm, the Lunar's claw attacks are

        Lunars who know the Adder Fang Method can
        enhance their attacks with venom. The Charm momentarily
        creates poison generating glands or ducts,
        releasing toxins whenever the Lunar successfully
        makes an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts bite attack.
        In addition to the normal damage of the attack, if the
        target takes damage, she suffers an additional number
        of dice of lethal damage equal to the Stamina +
        Essence of the Lunar. This damage is soaked separately
        and does not add extra successes. However, it
        ignores the target's armor â€” only Stamina and other
        natural soak apply.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar channels Essence
        into his digestive system, momentarily transforming
        his stomach acids into a lethal weapon. He can spit
        this corrosive phlegm at a target within 10 yards. The
        attack uses Dexterity + Thrown or Athletics with a -
        1 accuracy modifier. The opponent may dodge but
        not parry. The attack inflicts 8L + extra successes.
        The Burning Saliva Attack continues to harm the
        opponent each turn until it is washed off or otherwise
        removed. Scraping the acid off requires a Dexterity +
        Athletics roll and is not a reflexive action - the
        victim or one of his associates must use a dice action
        to do so, though she need not roll.&lt;br&gt;
        Rather than directly attacking an enemy with
        his acid saliva, the Lunar can target the opponent's
        weapon. The accuracy of such attacks is -2, and
        rather than the opponent soaking the damage, her
        weapon must do so. Its soak is equal to its damage
        value (so a straight sword that inflicts +3L has a soak
        of 3). Roll unsoaked damage dice normally, and every
        two successes reduce the weapon's damage value by
        one. If the weapon's damage reaches 0, the weapon is
        rendered useless. The acid continues to harm the
        weapon until it is removed, which requires a non-reflexive
        Dexterity + Athletics action, though the player of
        the character removing the acid need not actually roll.
        Such an attack doesn't affect weapons made of the Five
        Magical Materials.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A sufficiently skilled Lunar can adjust the lethality
        of his acid saliva, adjusting its damage and efficacy to
        meet specific requirements. One such alternative is to
        reduce the damage of the attack in favor of more precise
        targeting of the attack. A Lunar may attack as per the
        Burning Saliva Attack (range 10 yards, accuracy - 1,
        damage 8L + extra successes, opponent may not parry),
        and if the attack is successful, his player rolls damage
        normally. However, as well as inflicting health levels of
        damage, such an attack can reduces of the target's
        Physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity and Stamina),
        his Appearance or his Perception. After rolling for
        damage, the Lunar may sacrifice a health level of
        damage to reduce one of the target's Physical Attributes,
        his Appearance or his Perception by one dot.
        An Attribute cannot be reduced below 1 with this
        Charm. An Exalt requires a week of healing to recover
        each Attribute point lost, but such injuries are permanent
        if inflicted on mortals.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By adjusting the composition of his saliva, the
        Lunar can transform the Burning Saliva Attack from
        an agonizing assault into a means of subduing a foe.
        The Soporific Venom Attack functions as per the
        Burning Saliva Attack, attacking at - 1 accuracy at a
        range of 10 yards. However, the damage it inflicts is
        14B + extra successes. The target may be rendered
        insensate in two ways: He may sustain sufficient bashing
        damage to render him incapacitated, or the toxin
        may shock him into unconsciousness. The latter may
        happen if the number of bashing health levels inflicted
        by a single attack after damage is rolled exceeds
        the target's Stamina Attribute. If it does, the target's
        player must make a reflexive Stamina + Endurance
        roll against a difficulty equal to the Lunar's Essence. If
        the defender succeeds, he simply takes the bashing
        damage from the attack. Otherwise, he is immediately
        rendered unconscious for a number of minutes equal
        to the Lunar's Stamina + Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Deadly Viper Strike allows the Lunar to create
        and use a more toxic variant of the venom in the Adder
        Fang Method. This Charm must be used as part of an
        unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack. In addition to
        the normal attack damage, the venom injected into the
        target causes injury and pain, though the immediate
        damage is less than for the Adder Fang Method toxin.
        Instead, if the Lunar's attack was successful and does
        damage, the victim's player must roll Stamina + Endurance
        against a difficulty equal to the Lunar's Essence. If
        the roll fails, the target suffers an automatic level of
        lethal damage, and his player must roll again (at the
        same difficulty) next turn. Success indicates that the
        target sustains no injury, and any additional successes
        reduce the difficulty of resisting next turn. If the difficulty
        is reduced to 0, the poison is no longer effective.
        A botch indicates that the target suffers two automatic
        levels of lethal damage, and the difficulty of resisting
        next turn increases by one.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Fists, fangs and talons are only the most obvious
        components of a Lunar's arsenal. Using the Rabid Beast
        Bite, a Lunar Exalt can focus tainted traces of Essence
        into an injury, no matter how insignificant. Any wounds
        caused by a Brawl or Martial Arts attack supplemented
        by Rabid Beast Bite are likely to become infected, even
        if the attack inflicted only bashing damage.&lt;br&gt;
        Players must make a roll for their characters to
        avoid infection on any injury caused by such an
        attack. Wounds that would normally have a chance of
        infection (those inflicting lethal or aggravated damage)
        increase the difficulty of the roll to avoid infection
        by the Lunar's Essence, and rolls for the unExalted to
        recover from the infection are also increased by the
        Lunar's Essence. The difficulty of avoiding infection
        from bashing damage is 1. The cost of this Charm must
        be paid before the Lunar makes his attack roll. Using
        the Rabid Beast Bite on another Lunar is considered
        a sign of great disrespect.

        Prerequisite Charms: Rabid Beast Bite&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Some Lunars regard rending an opponent's body as
        too swift a punishment for whatever her offense has been
        and seek to prolong the agony and distress of their
        opponent. By means of the Form-Destroying Touch, the
        Lunar uses his protean abilities to disrupt the body of his
        opponent. The effects are weak at first but persist, with
        increasing effectiveness. If the technique is successful,
        wild mutations spring up on the victim's body, slowly
        consuming and warping her form until nothing is left but
        a shapeless mass.&lt;br&gt;
        The Form-Destroying Touch must be activated
        before the Lunar makes an unarmed Brawl or Martial
        Arts attack. The Charm has no effect unless the Exalt
        gets at least one success on his attack roll â€” if the attack
        roll fails or if the target blocks or dodges the attack, the
        Charm has no effect, and the motes and Willpower are
        lost. However, if the attack lands, the Lunar's player
        rolls damage dice as normal â€” which the target cannot
        soak - though no actual damage is recorded on the
        target's health levels. Instead, if the successes inflicted
        by the attack equal or exceed the target's Stamina, the
        Lunar has implanted part of his protean power in the
        victim, with potentially devastating consequences. If
        the phantom damage does not exceed the victim's
        Stamina, the Charm dissipates with no lasting effect.&lt;br&gt;
        The target of a successful Form-Destroying Touch
        suffers no ill effects for the first day after she has been
        attacked, though the corrupt Essence is already at
        work. Each day after the first, anomalies begin to
        emerge, and the target must attempt to resist the
        corruption (roll Stamina + Endurance against a difficulty
        equal to the Lunar's Essence). If the roll succeeds,
        she resists ill effects for that day. If the roll fails, she
        suffers aggravated damage; the first time this happens,
        the damage is a single die, but it increases to two dice
        the second time the roll fails, three the third, and so
        forth, as the contagion continues to spread its mutations
        and damage. These damage dice are rolled
        normally. If the number of contagion-inflicted aggravated
        health levels of damage exceeds the victim's
        Essence + Stamina, the victim's body looses cohesion,
        and she dies, transmuted into a chaotic jumble of
        mutated organs and protoplasmic sludge.&lt;br&gt;
        Form-Destroying Touch cannot be used on those
        immune to shapeshifting (such as Lunars) or where a
        Charm or sorcery prevents the Lunar from touching his
        victim or shields the target from Wyld mutation. Mortal
        medicine is powerless to cure the Form-Destroying Touch,
        though Charms such as Bodily Regeneration Prana can
        negate the effect of Form-Destroying Touch if they cure
        all the aggravated damage from the character's health
        track. Disease-curing Charms and magical remedies do
        nothing unless they are of incredible power (the legendary
        Panacea Pipe might cure an afflicted character, for
        example). The notable exception is the cure-all Sweet
        Cordial (see Exalted, p. 336, which allows the victim's
        player a regular Stamina + Resistance roll at difficulty 1
        to defeat the infection.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can fashion part of his
        body â€” usually the hair or a tail â€” into the form of a
        venomous snake or snakes. If doesn't matter if the Lunar
        has one large snake or many smaller ones, the effect is the
        same. These snake-buds act pseudo-independently of
        the Lunar. Though limited in reach to half the Lunar's
        Essence in yards (rounded down), the snakes can attack
        independently of the character. The snake or snakes
        attack targets of the Exalt's player's choosing and act on
        the Lunar's initiative. The snake-extensions fight with
        half (round down, minimum 1) the Lunar's Attribute
        and Ability scores and do Strength + 1L base damage.
        They act once per turn but can split their dice pool
        normally. Though lacking the raw strength of the Exalt,
        a serpent's bite is venomous, acting in the same manner
        as the Deadly Viper Strike (see above). However, the
        venom is less than the Lunar's own, and the victim's
        player need only roll Stamina + Endurance against a
        difficulty equal to half the Lunar's Essence (rounded
        down, minimum 1).&lt;br&gt;
        A snake may be attacked independently of the
        Lunar and has 3 health levels: -1, -2 and -4. A fourth
        point of damage &amp;quot;kills&amp;quot; or disables the snake. These
        wounds do not affect the Lunar while the snake remains
        in existence, but if he chooses to discontinue the
        Charm, half (round up) of any wounds suffered by the
        character's ophidian offshoots transfer to the Exalt.
        Damaged snakes heal at the same rate as an Exalt (not
        as fast as the Lunar using the Charm); dead snakes do
        not heal. While a snake remains &amp;quot;alive,&amp;quot; a Lunar Exalted
        cannot be subjected to an unanticipated attack by
        a visible foe. The snakes cannot parry or dodge, but a
        Lunar whose snake-extensions are attacked can parry or
        dodge the attack as if it was against the Lunar himself.
        A Lunar cannot use this Charm more than once at a
        time on himself.

        Ordinarily, a Lunar can only attack targets within
        arm's reach. The Monkey Arm Style allows the Lunar to surprise
        his opponents by extending his reach by a number of yards equal to his
        Essence. The Charm causes one or both of the Lunar's
        arms to elongate, reshaping bone and muscle to create a
        long, sinuous limb that, despite its snake-like appearance,
        remains fully functional. The hand can grasp objects or targets
        but lacks the finesse required to wield a weapon
        effectively. The Monkey Arm Style can be used on its own to
        extend the Lunar's reach for an instant, but it is most commonly
        used as part of a Brawl or Martial Arts attack, allowing
        the character to make unarmed attacks or wrestling
        maneuvers at a distance equal to his Essence in yards.

        multiple, writhing tentacles. Anything held in that
        limb is dropped, and while the Exalted's natural weaponry
        functions as normal, the damage is always converted
        to bashing before it is applied to the target. Each of the
        tentacles is capable of making a separate attack at the
        Lunar's full Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts dice,
        although all must attack the same target within a
        number of yards equal to twice the Lunar's Essence. If
        the defender dodges, make one roll and apply it to all
        attacks. However, parry attempts must be made against
        each attack. The tentacles re-form into the original
        limb after the attacks are made. The Exalted cannot
        create more tentacles than his permanent Essence.

        Prerequisite Charms: Startling Tentacle Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        By increasing the amount of Essence he commits
        when creating tentacles, the Lunar can strike at targets
        further away, allowing him to make hand-to-hand at-
        tacks at incredible range. The Lunar can make a number
        of tentacle attacks up to his permanent Essence, and
        each tentacle may make a separate attack at the Lunar's
        full Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts. A tentacle does
        damage as if it were a normal unarmed attack by the
        Lunar. Each tentacle may attack the same target, or they
        may attack different victims, but each defender must be
        in sight and within a number of yards of the Lunar equal
        to (the Lunar's Essence x 10). Roll each attack sepa-
        rately, but if the target parries or dodges the attack, make
        one roll and apply it to all attacks directed against him.
        As a result, the Lunar's opponent may avoid some none,
        some or all of the tentacles. The tentacles re-form into
        the original limb immediately after the attacks are made.
        The cost of the Charm is 4 motes per tentacle if all are
        directed at a single target, or 5 motes per tentacle if the
        attacks are targeted at multiple foes.

        Prerequisite Charms: Tentacle-Spear Strike&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        By directing his pseudopodia at an opponent's
        weapon, the Lunar can use the multiplicity of the
        tentacles and their speed and reach to foil the
        opponent's attacks. The maximum number and reach
        of the tentacles is as per the Tentacle-Spear Strike
        (Essence x 10 in yards, no more than Essence tentacles),
        but rather than rolling Dexterity + Brawl, the
        Lunar's player rolls Strength + Brawl, adding 1 die for
        each tentacle formed. The opponent may seek to parry
        or dodge the attack, but if the number of successes
        remaining after defense still exceeds the target's Dexterity,
        she is disarmed. Weapon-Snatching Coils do
        not inflict damage on the target, and the attack cannot
        be split between multiple foes.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Lunars revel in the visceral nature of hand-to-hand
        combat, particularly when they can feel the breath of
        their opponents on their face. As a consequence, grap-
        pling is a favored technique. This Charm allows the
        Lunar to fortify his musculature, allowing his player to
        purchase additional dice up to the character's Dexterity
        when rolling a single wrestling attack with Martial Arts
        or Brawl. The Charm allows the addition of dice to
        enact, continue or escape from such maneuvers or to do
        extra points of damage in a clinch attack.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The pinnacle of their wrestling abilities, the Spine-Breaking
        Technique demonstrates the awesome power
        of the Lunars' bestial nature. By means of this Charm,
        the Lunar turns a painful and often incapacitating
        attack into a lethal demonstration of his prowess. The
        Lunar makes a clinch attack as normal, but rather than
        the normal bashing damage, the Spine-Breaking Technique
        inflicts lethal damage. The Spine-Breaking
        Technique is also very difficult for the victim to escape
        from, and the player of a Lunar who activated the
        technique with his last action adds the Lunar's Strength
        in automatic successes to the roll to resist any escape
        attempt. A Lunar caught in a clinch may activate this
        Charm on his action to do lethal damage. The Spine-Breaking
        Technique can be used in a Combo with
        Charms that increase the character's Strength but not
        with any that enhance Dexterity.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the Lunar to imbue his muscles
        with Essence, giving flesh and bone the strength and
        consistency of steel hawsers. When the character has
        successfully executed a clinch, tackle or throw or is doing
        damage from maintaining a clinch, this Charm allows
        the Lunar to transform dice up to his Strength into
        automatic damage successes. However, the maximum
        number of dice the Lunar can transform is equal to his
        Essence or Strength, whichever is lower. The Essence for
        this Charm is spent after soak is applied, so characters
        need not worry about wagering Essence. The Mighty
        Bear Crush can be used against any target the Lunar
        perceives, including dematerialized spirits.

        Prerequisite Charms: Mighty Bear Crush&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Lunars revel in close combat, and many are unafraid
        to place themselves in a disadvantageous position if
        doing so will aid their hunting companions. Indeed,
        doing so is seen by many as both a test of strength and
        courage. The Throat-Baring Hold is one of the most
        powerful expressions of this, allowing a Lunar who has
        his opponent in a hold to &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; the opponent's defenses
        to other attackers.&lt;br&gt;
        The Lunar must make a successful hold attack.
        Any extra successes reduce the target's lethal and
        bashing soak totals until the Lunar's next action or
        until the opponent breaks free. As with normal hold
        attacks, the Lunar's attack does not inflict damage. The
        Throat-Baring Hold may be maintained for multiple
        turns, but the Lunar must spend 5 motes and his action
        (and Charm) for the turn in order to maintain the
        Charm, and the target may break out, just as if it were
        a normal hold.&lt;br&gt;
        The penalty inflicted remains the same from turn
        to turn, until the hold is broken â€” a Lunar whose
        initial attack fares poorly must release his foe and apply
        the hold again to get a new result. In all turns after the
        initial attack, the Lunar's player may add the Exalt's
        Strength as automatic successes to the roll for the
        purposes of combating the target's escape attempts and
        reducing soak totals. Attacks against the target will
        not harm the Lunar - the Charm helps keep him clear
        of the incoming strikes - but a botched attack may
        still strike him.

        Prerequisite Charms: Mighty Bear Crush
        Despite their formidable strength and unparalleled
        martial prowess, a foe is sometimes able to resist
        the Lunar's attentions for a protracted period. Activating
        the Hyena Jaw Technique allows a Lunar who has
        his opponent in a clinch or hold to subdue the foe
        quickly. The Charm, usable only in beastman form,
        allows the Lunar to extend his neck and muzzle, allowing
        him to clamp his jaws on the opponent's throat.
        Every turn the Charm is in effect, the target loses a dot
        of temporary Stamina and falls unconscious if reduced
        to 0 Stamina. If the target attempts to break away from
        the clinch or hold, she must soak lethal damage equal
        to the Lunar's Strength + 2, irrespective of the success
        (or otherwise) of her player's escape roll. If the target
        falls unconscious as a result of Stamina loss or her
        injuries, further damage inflicted by the Hyena Jaw
        Technique reduces one of the target's Mental Attributes
        (Perception, Intelligence or Wits) by one, but
        not below 0. If all four targeted Attributes are reduced
        to 0, the target dies. A victim of Hyena Jaw Technique
        regains one Attribute dot per day.

        Prerequisite Charms: Bear Embrace Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Though reveling in close combat, there are times
        Lunars seek to escape the clutches of their opponents
        and brute strength is not enough. This Charm, which
        can only be used when in the hybrid beastman form,
        allows the Lunar to give his foe a deadly surprise. After
        activating the Charm, the Lunar sprouts a number of 6-inch
        long, razor-sharp spines. Anyone who is clinching
        the Lunar when the spines form or who thereafter
        clinches, holds or otherwise engages in wrestling with
        the Lunar, risks grave injury. Those clinching or holding
        the Lunar suffer damage equal to the Lunar's Strength +
        5L, and the Lunar substitutes this for his normal damage
        when he does damage in a clinch.&lt;br&gt;
        Any unarmed attacks made by the Lunar while the
        spines are extended inflict lethal damage rather than
        bashing. Players of characters who make unarmed
        attacks against a Lunar using the Cunning Porcupine
        Defense must make a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics
        roll (Difficulty 3) or else their characters suffer lethal
        damage equal to their own Strength. Regardless, the
        Lunar takes damage from the opponent's attack as
        normal. The Cunning Porcupine Defense remains in
        effect as long as the Lunar commits Essence to the
        Charm and stays in beastman form. If the Lunar leaves
        hybrid form or stops committing Essence, the spines
        merge back into his body.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can tear a fragment from
        her bones and reform her muscles to launch it from her
        body, hurling it at an opponent within a range of (her
        Perception x 10) in yards. This attack is horrible to
        behold, as the shard tears free of the Lunar's body in a
        shower of blood and torn tissue, which, like the bone,
        regenerates near-instantly. The attack is made with
        Dexterity + Archery or Thrown, at - 1 accuracy, and it
        inflicts (9L + extra successes) damage.

        Rather than simply wounding an opponent, a Lunar
        may use her strength and body mass to overbear the
        opponent and force him into a disadvantageous position.
        Using the Angry Rhino Charge after making a successful
        Brawl or Martial Arts attack allows the Lunar's player to
        purchase extra dice of damage up to the Exalt's Strength
        Attribute. These bonus dice do not add to the damage
        inflicted by the attack, but they do count toward deter-
        mining knockdown and/or knockback (see Exalted, pp.
        234-235) and also determine the difficulty of the target's
        roll to avoid knockdown.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Ma-Ha-Suchi, in beastman form, uses
        the Angry Rhino Charge in his battle with the Terrestrial
        Gavus. After Ma-Ha-Suchi successfully strikes the Dragon-
        Blooded, 3 motes are spent to purchase six extra dice to
        supplement the ancient Lunar's natural Strength. Gavus has
        a combined Stamina + Resistance of 8, which Ma-Ha-
        Suchi's damage dice exceed. Gavus' player must therefore get
        five successes (the number of dice purchased by Ma-Ha-Suchi),
        or the Dragon-Blood suffers knockdown.

        The Lunars can grow not only tentacles, but also
        other enhancements as well. Through the use of this
        Charm, the Lunar reshapes his head to be like that of a
        bull, including the bull's deadly horns, for the instant of
        an attack. Using the Bull Head Technique, a Lunar who
        is charging into combat (that is, who moves his full
        movement allowance for the turn) may focus his Essence
        to maximize damage to his opponent. After the Lunar
        makes a successful Brawl or Martial Arts attack, his
        player can purchase additional damage dice up to the
        value of the Exalt's Strength Attribute. All damage from
        the Bull Head Technique is lethal. Bonus damage is
        applied before soak, not after.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Though Lunars enjoy the thrill of combat, they
        don't always want to kill their foes. In many cases, they
        seek simply to subdue them, as part of a ritual or demonstrative
        duel or to claim a ransom from the defeated foe.
        This Charm envelopes the Lunar's limbs in Essence,
        lending his blows considerable weight but also cushioning
        the target from the worst effects of the blow. When
        rolling damage for an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack, the Lunar's player can transform a number of dice
        up to a maximum of his character's Essence into automatic
        successes at the cost of 1 mote per die. Attacks
        enhanced with Subduing the Honored Foe automatically do bashing damage only.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm's effects take place immediately after
        soak is applied, but the player must pick before he makes
        the attack roll how many motes to spend converting dice
        of damage into automatic successes. If the player pays to
        convert more damage dice than he rolls, the extra
        Essence invested is wasted. If the target remains conscious
        after the attack but suffered more levels of bashing
        damage than her Stamina, she is dazed, and her player
        must make a successful reflexive Willpower roll (difficulty
        of the Lunar's Strength) or have her character
        spend her next action shaking off the attack's effects.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Some Lunars employ finesse in combat, but most
        prefer brute force, and the Body Breaking Kata reflects
        this fact. It is not a subtle attack, but instead, employs a
        combination of size, strength and outright aggression to
        overwhelm an opponent. The Charm is only effective if
        the Lunar charges into close combat with her opponent
        - she must move half her movement allowance before
        engaging the foe. The Lunar channels Essence through
        her body while making a single unarmed Martial Arts or
        Brawl attack. This Essence charge seems to cause the
        Lunar's form to swell and take on giant proportions for an
        instant. As far as observers are concerned, the target is
        charged by a monstrous version of the Lunar's totem.
        The player of the attacking Lunar should roll Dexterity
        + Brawl or Martial Arts as normal for the attack but
        double the number of extra successes before applying the
        target's soak. All damage from the Body Breaking Kata is
        lethal.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Maintaining the initiative in combat is often as
        important as the amount of damage inflicted on the
        opponent. Keeping control of the direction of a fight
        often takes precedence over inflicting injuries in the
        short term. The Foot-Confusing Buffet allows the Lunar
        to keep an opponent off balance, sacrificing one or more
        damage dice from a successful Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack in favor of an initiative penalty for the foe in the
        following turn. The Charm surrounds the Lunar's attacking
        limbs with a nimbus of light, creating a
        mesmerizing series of patterns that distract the foe. The
        Lunar must activate the Charm before making his attack,
        paying the basic Essence cost even if the attack
        misses. Only if the attacking Lunar gets at least one extra
        success does the Foot-Confusing Buffet come into play.
        The Lunar may sacrifice a number of dice of damage up
        to his Essence or Strength score, whichever is lowest.
        Damage dice are sacrificed before soak is applied. The
        number of points sacrificed is applied as a penalty to the
        target's player's initiative roll in the next turn.

        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can focus his wrath
        on an inanimate object, dealing it a devastating blow to
        rend it into splinters. This attack is particularly effective
        against man-made objects, but it may be used against any
        non-living, non-magical item. When striking the object,
        the Lunar focuses his strength and aggression into
        the blow, as well as Essence. Every mote expended adds
        one die of damage to a single attack by the Lunar against
        an item. If the item is man-made, then each mote spent
        is worth two automatic damage successes instead. The
        Lunar's player cannot spend more motes when using this
        Charm than the character's Strength.

        Strength is only part of winning a fight. Knowing
        where to hit the opponent to gain maximum effect is an
        equally important consideration â€” perhaps more important
        in the case of fast, agile Lunars. Using this Charm,
        the Lunar guides a single unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        blow to the enemy's weak point, circumventing his
        armor and defenses. For every 2 motes spent, the Lunar
        may reduce the soak rating of her opponent's armor by 1.
        This applies to armor soak only â€” the target's natural
        soak is unaffected. The attack cannot reduce the soak of
        an opponent's armor by more than the Lunar's own
        Dexterity or below O. The soak reduction applies only for
        the enhanced single attack. This Charm is of instant
        duration â€” if the Lunar makes multiple attacks in a turn
        and desires to reduce the opponent's armor soak each
        time, she must pay for each reduction separately.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A Lunar's claws are formidable weapons, but the
        protective effects of armor can blunt the strikes of even
        the mightiest Exalts. By means of this Charm, a Lunar
        can reduce the efficacy of his opponent's armor, directing
        his attacks at the protective layers rather than
        directly at the opponent. To do so, he transforms his
        claws into vicious, hooked rending devices, lacking the
        length to cause serious harm to the opponent but grant-
        ing them sufficient strength and resilience to rend even
        the hardest armors.&lt;br&gt;
        The Lunar makes an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack as normal, including determining the amount of
        raw damage before soak. The opponent may reduce the
        attack's damage only using his armor's lethal soak rating,
        not his Stamina or any enhancements, unless they specifically
        reinforce the armor. Unlike a normal soak, this
        may reduce the damage of the attack to O. Roll any
        remaining damage dice normally, and subtract the number
        of successes from all of the armor's soak ratings. This
        reduction is a permanent one, reflecting the Lunar's
        efforts to shred and rend the armor, though a skilled
        armorer may be able to affect repairs. If the number of
        successful damage dice exceeds the armor's soak rating,
        the armor is destroyed (irreparably), with the excess
        applied to the opponent (who may soak with her Stamina)
        as health levels of lethal damage. The Armor-Rending
        Claw Fist is not effective against armor made from the
        Five Magical Materials.

        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can perceive the
        flows of Essence around his target, using them to guide
        his blows to best effect. For each mote of Essence spent
        on this Charm, the Lunar gains an additional attack die
        on a single Melee attack. These bonus dice may not
        exceed the character's Dexterity.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can imbue his weapon
        with preternatural speed, using his Essence and instincts
        to enhance the tempo of his attack. When rolling initiative
        for a turn in which the character plans to make a
        Melee attack, the Lunar may spend Essence to improve
        his initiative rating for a single turn, each mote buying a
        +1 modifier. The character cannot spend more motes
        than he has points of Dexterity. The Essence cost of the
        Charm is paid before making the initiative roll. The
        Striking Raptor Method cannot be used in a Combo with
        any other Charm that gives an initiative bonus.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By fortifying his attacking weapon with Essence, a
        Lunar can make it very difficult for his opponent to block
        a single attack with a hand-to-hand weapon. Players
        rolling to defend against this attack must roll two successes
        for each of the Exalt's own successes they seek to
        negate. If a defender rolls an odd number of successes, the
        extra success is wasted.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Red Jaw uses the Ferocious Biting Sword
        to enhance his attacks on a Solar. His reaver daiklave,
        Winter's Heart, arcs round at the enemy, and Red Jaw's
        player gets four successes on the attack. The Storyteller rolls
        the Solar's parry and gets seven successes. Ordinarily, this
        would cancel out Red Jaw's attack, but as the Ferocious
        Biting Sword Charm was in effect, it only cancels three of the
        successes, with the seventh success on the parry discarded.
        With one success remaining, Red Jaw's attack succeeds.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By using the Dance of the Living Blade, the
        Lunar can make multiple Melee attacks per turn.
        These may be against the same foe or against multiple
        foes within a distance in yards equal to the Lunar's
        Dexterity. Each additional attack costs 3 motes of
        Essence, and the Lunar may purchase no more additional
        attacks than he has points of Essence. Each
        attack is made with the Lunar's full dice pool and must
        be parried or dodged separately. A Lunar can buy no
        more extra actions than (the initiative on which he
        activated this Charm Ã· 3, rounded down). This
        normally means (the character's initiative Ã· 3), but
        Lunars who hold their action and then invoke this
        Charm may lose extra actions.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can face multiple
        foes and force them onto the defensive. The Irresistible
        Storm Attack allows the Lunar to make a
        number of Melee attacks equal to his Essence. All
        the foes targeted by this Charm must be within a
        number of yards of the Lunar equal to twice his
        Dexterity. Each target of the Irresistible Storm Attack
        is subject to a full attack. In addition, for each
        additional mote the character spends, he may force
        all his opponents to either give up one yard of
        ground or give him a bonus Dexterity die, as per the
        Ferocious Avalanche Technique. The Irresistible
        Storm Attack cannot be used in a Combo with
        Charms that grant extra attack dice or extra actions.
        As with the Ferocious Avalanche Technique, the
        maximum number of bonus dice the character can
        gain is equal to his Dexterity. Each attack must be at
        a different foe, and no foe can be attacked more than
        once. Unused extra attacks are wasted.

        By means of this Charm, activated immediately
        after rolling initiative, a Lunar armed with two hand-to-hand
        weapons can attack a single opponent twice in a
        single turn. One action is made with each weapon. Each
        attack uses the Lunar's full dice pool at the character's
        full initiative score, and neither attack is considered to
        be with the character's off hand. The Lunar using the
        Spinning Blade Attack may abort one or both of these
        attacks to parries and, thus, can attack twice, attack and
        parry or parry twice at his full dice pool in the same turn,
        provided the actions are against the same opponent.

        The Lightning Sword Method allows a Lunar armed
        with two weapons to attack one or two opponents in the
        same turn. The mechanics are as per the Spinning Blade
        Attack, save that both actions need not be directed
        against the same target, though the Lunar's attack has no
        greater range than normal, so both foes must be within
        the distance the Lunar can move for the turn.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, the Lunar becomes a whirling
        killing machine, constantly moving and attacking, ever
        aware of his surroundings. While using this Charm, the
        Lunar gets an initiative bonus equal to half (round down)
        the number of yards he moved the previous turn. The
        Charm remains active so long as the Lunar keeps moving
        and commits Essence to it. If he is forced to stop moving,
        the Charm ends. Additionally, while the Charm is active,
        the Lunar can turn to meet any attack and cannot be
        ambushed or attacked from the rear. The Dust Devil
        Advance cannot be used in a Combo with any other
        Charm that gives an initiative bonus. This Charm cannot
        give the Lunar more bonus dice than his Dexterity.

        By suddenly transforming his body â€” extending
        his reach, adding an extra joint in an arm and so forth
        â€” the Lunar performs an &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot; maneuver. As
        a result, he automatically wins initiative against a
        single opponent. This Charm can be activated at any
        point prior to the Lunar's actual action, so the player
        could roll initiative as normal but choose to activate
        this Charm depending on the actions of others. When
        used in a Combo with extra action type Charms, the
        Charm does not need to be applied to every action in
        that Combo. The Twisting Surprise Attack cannot be
        used in a Combo with any other Charm that gives an

        This Charm allows the Lunar to extend his body in
        wild and improbable ways, wrong-footing his opponent,
        keeping her off balance by force of arms and wearing
        down her defenses until she makes a deadly error. When
        activating this Charm, the Lunar's player rolls the attack
        dice normally, but if the player gets 3 or more successes
        (not extra successes) on the attack roll, the Lunar may
        immediately attack the same target again. If the second
        attack also gets 3 successes, the Lunar can attack again,
        and so on, up to a maximum number of attacks equal to
        the Lunar's Dexterity. All attacks must be at the same
        target. Damage for each attack is resolved normally
        before the next attack is launched, so unless the target
        has powerful defensive Charms, she will surely falter.
        The Foe-Driving Attack may not be used in any Combo
        that includes Charms that provide automatic successes
        on the attack roll.

        The Lunar may combine his mastery of weapons and
        his protean nature to counter the efforts of an unwary
        foe, adjusting his weapon's path at the last moment to
        negate defensive moves. If an opponent attempts to
        parry a Lunar's Melee attack but does not completely
        block it, the Lunar's player can use the Monkey Paw
        Advantage to reroll the parried successes as another
        attack with the same weapon, paying 1 mote per die
        rerolled. If the opponent has actions remaining, she can
        attempt to parry these rerolled attack dice. The Monkey
        Paw Advantage confers no benefit if the target dodges.
        The Monkey Paw Advantage cannot be included in a

        Using this Charm, the Lunar can elongate one of his
        arms to retrieve a weapon that has been knocked from his
        grasp or to otherwise arm himself. The arm may extend
        to a number of yards equal to twice the Lunar's Essence,
        grabs the weapon, then returns to its normal length with
        the weapon ready to use. The extension and contraction
        of the arm are almost simultaneous, and so, the Weapon
        Clutching Method cannot be used to attack at a distance.
        Lunars who wish to make a ranged Melee attack
        will need to use the Surprising Gibbon Attack.

        In addition to proving a major advantage in weaving
        past an opponents defenses, a Lunar's protean flexibility
        helps to make disarming opponents easy. The Lunar
        merely extends her limbs and alters the way her joints
        move in order to give her a considerable edge. When
        attempting a disarming attack (see Exalted, pp. 238-
        239), the Lunar can purchase additional dice up to her
        Dexterity. When using this Charm, the difficulty of
        disarming in melee combat decreases to 2. The target
        may parry the attempt as usual, but his player's reflexive
        Wits + Melee roll requires one more success than the
        Lunar's disarming roll to be effective.

        Even allowing for the reach of limbs and weapons,
        melee combat requires the combatants to be within a
        few yards of each other. Longer weapons â€” such as
        pole arms â€” can confer considerable advantages,
        particularly when facing mounted opponents. Lunar
        Exalted may adjust their bodies to adjust circum-
        stances in their favor â€” they can elongate one or both
        limbs, allowing them to attack opponents some dis-
        tance. A Lunar using this Charm may attack at a
        distance of up to his Essence in yards. If the opponent
        is more than three yards from the Lunar, she will be
        unable to make a hand-to-hand counterattack and
        must move before engaging the Exalt in hand-to-hand
        combat. Any weapon wielded in this manner â€” even
        a knife â€” is considered a long weapon, and the Lunar
        does not suffer the usual penalties for attacking mounted
        opponents from on foot.

        By means of this Charm, a Lunar's control over his
        weapon is without peer, and he can steer his attack to its
        most deadly effect: Blades carve through flesh, and blunt
        weapons break bones like porcelain. After an opponent
        has applied his soak to an attack the Lunar makes using
        a hand-to-hand weapon, the Lunar may pay 3 motes of
        Essence per remaining damage point of damage. Each
        point paid for in this manner becomes an automatic
        success. The Lunar cannot buy more automatic successes
        than his permanent Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By lunging at his foe and binding Essence into his
        attacks, a Lunar can inflict monstrous damage on his
        opponent. The shocking impact of such an attack is
        devastating and quite often ends the battle in the Lunar's
        favor. The Lunar may enhance a single Melee attack by
        buying additional damage dice at a cost of 3 motes per
        die. The maximum number of points that can be added
        is equal to the Lunar's Strength rating. This must be done
        before the attack is rolled.&lt;br&gt;
        The attack may be dodged as normal, but the
        difficulty of parrying an attack augmented with this
        Charm is greatly increased. All parry attempts must first
        overcome a base difficulty equal to the number of motes
        spent fueling Tiger Claw Swat before they subtract
        successes from the attack. This doesn't enhance the
        attack. They simply increase the difficulty of the target's
        parry and do not add to the damage of the Lunar's
        attack. The difficulty modifier is applied first and must
        be overcome before the extra successes can be applied
        to defending against the Lunar's blow. Tiger Claw Swat
        cannot be used in a Combo with other Charms that
        increase damage dice.

        Scars are an integral part of Lunar Exalted society,
        maintaining the Lunars' form and used as a means of
        counting coup. Scarring an opponent, without causing
        serious injury, is an unsubtle means of demonstrating
        martial superiority. A Lunar enacting this Charm can
        turn the Dexterity dice in his Dexterity + Melee attack
        pool into automatic successes when attempting to mark
        a target (see Exalted, p. 238). The opponent may parry
        or dodge as normal, reducing the net successes for the
        marking attempt.&lt;br&gt;
        Ritual scarring forms part of several Lunar events,
        and the Scar-Making Blow is used in some cases to
        impart the markings. In such cases, the target willingly
        undergoes the marking, and the number of successes
        needed to mark the target is reduced to 1. Scars imparted
        by this Charm are simply the product of healing and lack
        the magical strength of those imparted by the No Moon
        Caste's Form-Fixing Method.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By making a series of swift and decisive blows, a
        Lunar can unbalance his opponent. By using the
        Ferocious Avalanche Technique, the Lunar forces
        his opponent to give ground. For each mote of Essence
        spent by the Lunar, his target must either back
        off a yard or allow the Lunar to gain a bonus attack
        die. If the opponent has not yet acted this turn or has
        moved less than half his move allowance, he may
        back off as a reflexive action. If the opponent does not
        (or cannot) back away, the Lunar gains a number of
        bonus attack dice equal to the distance the target
        didn't move. The maximum bonus the Lunar can
        gain from this attack is equal to his Dexterity, and
        these are Dexterity bonus dice.&lt;br&gt;
        For example: A Lunar attacks and puts 3 motes of
        Essence into the Ferocious Avalanche Technique. His opponent
        must either back up three yards or else the Lunar gains
        +3 attack dice. If the opponent backed up a yard but could go
        no further due to an obstacle, the Lunar would gain + 2 attack
        dice (3 - the distance in yards moved).

        Using the Limb-Maiming Flourish, a Lunar uses
        Essence to maximize the lethal effect of her weapon,
        guiding it to the points that will do most damage.
        When rolling damage, any 10s on the damage dice
        count as two successes. After determining the actual
        amount of damage inflicted, the Lunar may reduce one
        of the victim's Physical Attributes or Appearance by
        one instead of inflicting two health levels of damage.
        This may not reduce an Attribute below 1, nor may it
        be used to convert all damage into Attribute loss â€” the
        target must loose at least one health level per Attribute
        point lost. An Exalted requires a week of healing to
        recover each Attribute point lost, but such injuries are
        permanent if inflicted on mortals. Limb-Maiming Flourish
        cannot be used in a Combo with other Charms that
        increase damage dice.

        Most competent swordsmen can adjust their blows
        so as to cause bashing damage to their targets. The
        Lunar Exalted are considerably more formidable than
        any mortal swordsman, and their Essence-laden blows
        can fell even a Terrestrial. By means of the Thunderclap
        Method, a Lunar increases the strength of a Melee
        attack while softening its impact, so that it will only
        fell an enemy, rather than slay her. A blow enhanced
        by this Charm rings like thunder, stunning the opponent.
        Any attack enhanced with this Charm
        automatically does only bashing damage, but after
        subtracting soak from the damage of the attack, the
        Lunar can activate this Charm and pay 1 mote to
        change a remaining die of damage to an automatic
        success. Each remaining die becomes an automatic
        success, inflicting a level of bashing damage. A Lunar
        cannot buy more automatic damage successes in this
        fashion than he has points of Strength. The Charm
        cannot be part of a Combo with any other Charm that
        grants automatic damage successes.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Moonsilver weapons have an innate link to the
        Lunar Exalted, affording them considerable advantages
        in combat. Combining this Charm with a moonsilver
        weapon's fluid nature increases the difficulty of parrying
        or dodging the weapon; the weapon simply flows around
        the opponent's defenses or anticipates the defensive
        moves. Increase the number of successes needed to parry
        or dodge a single attack with a moonsilver weapon by up
        to the Exalt's Essence, at a cost of 2 per additional success
        required. These simply increase the difficulty of the
        target's parry roll and do not add to the damage of the
        Lunar's attack. The difficulty modifier is applied first and
        must be overcome before the extra successes can be
        applied to defend against the Lunar's blow. This Charm
        has no effect if the parrying weapon is also made of
        moonsilver, nor is it effective when attacking with
        moonsilver talons or teeth.

        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can further
        exploit his weapon's fluid form, rendering it into a truly
        devastating tool, for the edge flows into blows, seeking
        to widen and deepen cuts or reshaping itself to smash
        bones for maximum effect. When making a damage
        roll for a moonsilver weapon, the Lunar's player can
        purchase additional damage dice up to the weapon's
        damage rating. These points are added before soak is
        applied. Bonus dice of damage up to the Lunar's
        Strength cost 1 mote each, while those that exceed the
        character's Strength cost 3 motes each. Deadly
        Moonsilver Affinity cannot be used as part of a Combo

        A moonsilver weapon's edge is its most lethal aspect,
        inflicting heinous damage on the Lunar's foes. It is
        not, however, the only harm such weapons can inflict. A
        more insidious option is open to appropriately minded
        Lunars. By activating this Charm, the Lunar empowers
        his moonsilver weapon so that it gains a purpose even
        when beyond his hands. If the blow is successful, a
        fragment of the blade breaks off in the wound, remaining
        to cause grievous harm to the victim. The player must
        pay for the Charm before making the attack roll. For the
        magic to have effect, the attack must be successful and
        must inflict at least one health level of damage.&lt;br&gt;
        The attack does damage as normal, and a shard of
        moonsilver remains in the wound, slowly working its way
        through the victim's body. This causes one die of lethal
        damage per day and continues to cause damage until it is
        removed. Removing the shard requires at least Medicine
        3 and is Challenging (requires 3 successes). The removal
        procedure causes five dice of lethal damage, minus one
        die per extra success (to a minimum of 1L). Charms that
        heal aggravated damage, such as Bodily Regeneration
        Prana, can also be used to expel a moonsilver shard, as
        can a shapeshifting stunt. Activating this Charm lowers
        the weapon's damage rating by 1 until the next night the
        moon is full.

        A Lunar Exalted can use this Charm to sharpen his
        hand-eye coordination, making it easier to strike ranged
        targets. Careful observers (a reflexive Perception +
        Awareness roll, difficulty 3) will notice a change in the
        Lunar's eyes â€” they take on an avian aspect - but
        otherwise, his form is unchanged. When making an
        Archery or Thrown attack against a ranged target, the
        Lunar may convert attack dice into automatic successes.
        He may not, however, purchase more successes than his
        Dexterity score.

        By listening to his animal instincts, a Lunar can
        compensate for adverse environmental effects such as
        wind and rain on the flight path of his missile. The arrow
        always flies true, allowing the Exalt to ignore all environmental
        penalties during an Archery or Thrown attack.
        Nature's Harmony Advantage does not compensate for
        reduced visibility and must be included in a Combo with
        the Wolf Eye Advantage if the Lunar is to avoid all
        environmental penalties for ranged attacks.

        Cover is a target's best defense against missile attacks,
        but the preternaturally enhanced senses and reflexes
        of the Lunar Exalted can degrade its effectiveness. Using
        Knowing the Arrow's Path allows the Lunar to ignore
        cover penalties, including those of a shield, when firing
        at an opponent.

        By using his Essence to alter the arrow's flight, a
        Lunar can attack two targets with a single arrow, usually
        by shooting through the first target into the second. Both
        victims must be within two yards of each other. The
        Lunar's player makes a single Archery + Dexterity attack
        roll. If it succeeds, the successes are split as equally as
        possible between the two targets, who each may attempt
        to parry or dodge the attack as normal. If the Lunar's
        player rolls only one success, he picks who he attacks.
        Regardless of how the attack is described, determine the
        arrow's damage normally against target hit (i.e., arrows
        boosted by this Charm are not &amp;quot;slowed down&amp;quot; by passing
        through the chest of the first target, beyond dividing the
        successes of the attack).

        Shifting her body to give it an efficient, fluid grace,
        a Lunar archer can load and fire her bow with preternatural
        speed. For every 3 motes spent activating the Charm,
        the Lunar can make an additional Thrown or Archery
        attack, which may be at her first target or at any other
        target in range. The player must declare the number of
        attacks the Lunar is making before paying to activate the
        Charm. The player cannot buy more extra attacks than
        her character's permanent Essence Trait, nor can she buy
        more extra actions than (the initiative on which the
        character activated this Charm Ã· 3, rounded down).
        This normally means (the character's initiative + 3), but
        Lunars who hold their action and then invoke this
        Charm may lose extra actions. Each attack uses the
        character's full dice pool. The character cannot make an
        attack unless she has the ammunition to do so.

        Using this Charm to speed his drawing and firing,
        the Lunar can loft a series of arrows before the first has
        hit its target. Unlike regular shots, which are aimed at
        an individual, the Rain of Feathered Doom targets an
        area. The Lunar may fire as many arrows as (his
        Dexterity x the rate of the bow), subject to the number
        of arrows and motes of Essence available. For every
        two arrows fired, the Lunar may target a single individual,
        and each individual targeted costs 2 motes of
        Essence. All of the targets must be within (the Lunar's
        Dexterity) yards equal to of a center point picked by
        the Lunar. The targets do not gain the benefits of any
        movement or cover, so thick do the arrows fly. Make
        one attack roll, and apply it to all the targets, increasing
        the base difficulty of each attack by 1. Irrespective
        of the number of arrows fired, the Lunar may attack
        each target only once during the turn (the extra
        arrows are wasted).

        To an Exalt who can hit a dipping swallow at 100
        yards, striking a projectile in flight is only slightly more
        challenging. Using this Charm, the Lunar can attempt
        to deflect a ranged attack aimed at him by using a
        missile of his own. Toattempt this, the Lunar must have
        the bow and ammunition ready. The player makes a
        reflexive Dexterity + Archery or Thrown roll, with
        each success reducing the attacker's successes. If the
        Lunar's player rolls at least as many successes as the
        attacker's, the attack is disrupted in flight and causes no
        damage. If the Lunar's player does not equal or exceed
        the attacker's successes, then the attacker's successes
        are still reduced. This defense is only effective against
        ranged attacks, and the Lunar must expend one arrow
        per activation of this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        While Finding the Needle's Eye allows an Exalt to
        use arrows to defend himself from enemy missile
        attacks, protecting his allies is a more difficult task.
        Not only must he observe the path of projectiles
        inbound against multiple targets, but firing at those
        targets often requires him to hit a crossing target, not
        an issue when the Lunar himself was the target. The
        Arrow-Breaking Shot functions like Finding the
        Needle's Eye, save that that each deflection attempt
        costs more Essence and requires the number of successes
        to exceed those of the attacker for the deflection
        to be successful. As with Finding the Needle's Eye,
        above, the Charm can be used only against ranged
        attacks, and the Lunar must expend one arrow with
        each activation of the Charm.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can negate an opponent's
        cover by bouncing his missile off of several surfaces, his
        enhanced senses allowing him to calculate an unerring
        trajectory for a single Thrown or Archery attack. Each
        surface the missile must bounce off of to reach its target
        subtracts 1 from the attack's damage (meaning the
        character's Strength + the weapon's damage bonus). If
        the total damage reaches 0, the weapon's energy is spent,
        and it falls to the ground.

        So long as he is surrounded by raw materials â€” stones,
        twigs, bones, reeds, long blades of grass and the like â€” a
        Lunar will not run out of ammunition. Instead of drawing
        arrows from his quiver, the Lunar may instead pick up an
        appropriate piece of raw material â€” anything long and
        thin for arrows, and anything of roughly the correct shape
        for thrown weapons - and transform it into a missile
        suitable for firing from the bow or for throwing. The arrow
        retains the appearance of the raw material, but in the
        hands of the Lunar, it is a functional but non-magical item
        of that type. Only the Lunar can use weapons he has
        shaped. He can shape a maximum number of missiles equal
        to his Dexterity in a single turn and must use them within
        a number of turns equal to his Essence, for at the end of
        that time they revert to their raw form. Missiles embedded
        in their victims when they revert do an extra IL damage.

        By sharpening his senses, a Lunar can offset the
        disadvantage of poor visibility (but not for the effects of
        wind, rain and the like) on a missile's flight path. Activating
        this Charm allows the Lunar to treat visibility ranges
        as double their value for the purposes of a single Archery
        or Thrown attack. For example, on a foggy day the Lunar
        can attacks targets without penalty out to 20 yards and
        with +1 difficulty out to 60 yards. Furthermore, when
        using this Charm, a Lunar can make a blind attack out to
        200 yards and treats all night conditions as day (further
        including increasing visibility distances). See page 237 of
        Exalted for the visibility table.

        Range is the main enemy of archers, but by enhancing
        his senses to observe the flows of Essence within the
        air, the Lunar can use them to steer the shot to the target.
        The Lunar can attack out to two times the weapon's
        listed range at -1 die and out to three times the weapon's
        range at only -2 dice. Additionally, a Lunar using this

        All bows have a pull, and beyond this upper limit, the
        archer's strength has no appreciable effect, except perhaps
        to break the bow. Using this Charm to control his actions
        and Essence to reinforce the weapon, the Lunar can coax
        extra performance out of the bow. When firing, the Lunar's
        player must state the Strength the Lunar is using and can
        as much as double a bow's maximum Strength without
        harming the weapon. The player may increase the maximum
        Strength beyond double, but doing so requires him to
        make an immediate â€” before the shot is fired â€” reflexive
        Dexterity + Archery roll against a difficulty equal to the
        number of points by which he exceeded the weapon's
        maximum Strength. If he succeeds, the shot takes place as
        usual. If he fails, the bow breaks, and the Essence is wasted.
        If making multiple missile attacks, this Charm must be
        activated once for each shot, as usual for instant Charms.

        Ranged attacks incorporating the Lightning Stroke Attack
        exploit the Lunar's powers to this end, misdirecting
        the opponent's eye by warping limbs and the missile in
        flight. The attack is rolled normally, but the target cannot
        attempt to dodge or parry. Instead, she must rely on her
        soak to absorb the arrow's damage. The perfect defenses of
        the Solar Exalted, Charms such as Seven Shadow Evasion

        By using this Charm, the Lunar can tap into the
        flows of Essence and the senses of beasts in the area
        to target any opponent within reach of his weapon.
        He may attack any target in range with a single
        Thrown or Archery attack, even if no direct line of
        sight exists between Lunar and target. As long as
        there is some unblocked route the missile could
        take to the target, it will attempt to strike the
        victim. The normal range penalties apply to the
        attack, but the target cannot claim any cover modifiers.
        The target may attempt to parry or dodge and
        soak the attack normally, though she is unlikely to
        be aware of it and, so, should probably check for
        blindside. Riding the Secret Wind cannot be included
        in a Combo with any Charms with automatic
        damage successes.

        By means of this Charm, the Lunar focuses Essence
        into the skin of his hands and forearms, briefly
        causing them to become iron-hard. This allows the
        Lunar to parry hand-to-hand or ranged attacks, even
        if unarmed, though it confers no bonus to the parry
        and cannot be used as part of an offensive action.

        Cost: 2 motes per enemy denied&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One turn&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Steel Paw Style&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        In clear terrain, up to five opponents can attack a
        single target in a turn. By using the Ground-Denying
        Defense to focus his instincts, a Lunar can use the
        terrain and the opponent's own actions to limit the
        number of attackers he faces in a given turn. For every
        2 motes spent, the Lunar can reduce the maximum
        number of opponents able to attack him in a turn by
        one. Essence spent to activate this Charm must be spent
        before initiative is rolled for the turn. The Lunar has no
        control over which opponent he avoids â€” those with
        the highest initiative scores are still able to attack,
        while those with lower initiative values are evaded -
        nor can he reduce the maximum number of opponents
        by more than his Dexterity or below one. The Ground-Denying
        Defense can be used in any terrain, even open
        ground. If the terrain naturally reduces the number of
        potential attackers, for example a narrow passage, the
        Ground-Denying Defense reduces the modified maxi-
        mum number of attackers for that terrain but still
        cannot reduce the value below one.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: A Lunar with a Dexterity 3 could reduce
        the maximum number of opponents he faces by three at the
        cost of 6 motes. If he is facing five enemies, the two with the
        highest initiative totals could still attack him. If he was facing
        only three opponents, two would still be able to attack him â€”
        the Charm reduces the MAXIMUM number of attackers,
        not the actual number. In a narrow tunnel that allows a
        maximum of two attackers, a Lunar would only need to spend
        2 motes to reduce the number of attackers to one.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The preternatural speed of a Lunar Exalted gives
        him a substantial advantage when seeking to parry an
        opponent's attacks. Indeed, a sufficiently dexterous
        Lunar can use the Golden Tiger block to render himself
        almost unassailable. When making a parry, he may
        spend 1 mote to convert a die into an automatic
        success. He may only purchase as many automatic
        successes as he has points of Dexterity in that pool. A
        Lunar using the Golden Tiger Block may parry lethal
        damage even if unarmed.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can attempt to parry an
        attack directed at him, even if he is unaware of it (for
        example, an attack from the rear or by an invisible
        character). The Exalt allows instinct to guide his
        actions and, thus, can respond to events that have yet
        to register in his conscious mind. The Lunar gains no
        advantage in the parry action, but he may use his full
        dice pool in the attempt if he has not yet acted during
        the turn. The Lunar may postpone his action, but once
        he has taken it, he may not use Wary Swallow Method
        to gain a parry.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Like a cat, the Lunar is always ready to respond to
        attacks. By means of the Feline Guard Technique, a
        Lunar may parry an attack with his full relevant
        Ability pool total (meaning Dexterity + Ability + any
        weapon modifiers). The character cannot activate
        this Charm more times in a turn than he has points of
        permanent Essence. A Lunar cannot dodge during a
        turn in which he activates the Feline Guard Technique.
        A Lunar may not move more than half his
        movement allowance. Feline Guard Technique cannot
        be used in any Combos that contain extra action
        Charms. This Charm is not effective against attacks
        the character is not aware of.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using his superhuman reflexes, a Lunar Exalted
        who has yet to act may activate this Charm and abort
        his action to parry an attack directed at another
        character. This Charm is effective so long as the
        Lunar is aware of the attack, it is possible to parry it
        and the target is within (the Lunar's permanent
        Essence) yards. If the Lunar has already acted, then
        this Charm has no effect. The Lunar uses his entire
        dice pool to parry the attack, and any parry successes
        he gets are added to those achieved by the character
        he is aiding.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A skilled Lunar can turn his opponent's attack
        into a deadly counter, the Lunar extending and twist-
        ing his limbs in a manner that allows him to go on the
        offensive in hand-to-hand attacks. He parries at his
        full dice pool +2 Dexterity bonus dice in the parry
        attempt he enhances with the Crouching Tiger Stance,
        and if he completely blocks the attack, the Lunar may
        immediately make a reflexive Melee, Martial Arts or
        Brawl counterattack with his full dice pool against his
        opponent. If he only partially parries the blow, he
        cannot counterattack.&lt;br&gt;
        The Lunar must activate this Charm before he acts
        for the turn â€” he may postpone his action, as normal,
        but if the Lunar has already acted, then this Charm
        cannot be used in the turn. The Crouching Tiger
        Stance confers no advantages against a ranged attack,
        nor can it be used to counter counterattacks or against
        attacks the Lunar is not aware of.

        Mobility and agility are innate characteristics of the
        Lunar Exalted, who can use them to considerable effect
        when seeking to avoid damage. By activating this Charm
        when the player declares a full dodge (see Exalted, p.
        231), the Lunar does not suffer any dice-pool penalties
        for dodging multiple attacks for the rest of the turn. She
        may use her full Dexterity + Dodge pool against all
        attacks for the remainder of the turn, providing she is
        able to maneuver away from attacks. A Lunar rendered
        immobile by terrain, magic or other effects gains no
        advantage from the Bowing Reed Technique.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can use his Essence to
        enhance his dodging efforts. Upon activating this Charm,
        he moves as gracefully as a swan and as sure-footedly as
        a mountain goat. Before making a dodge roll, the Lunar's
        player may spend Essence to transform some of his dice
        on a dodge attempt into automatic successes at a cost of
        I mote per die converted. The Lunar's player may purchase
        as many automatic successes as the character's
        Dexterity Attribute, even if circumstances - such as
        making multiple evasion attempts while using full dodge
        â€” reduce the total dodge dice pool. If modifiers reduce
        the number of dice in the dodge pool below the character's
        Dexterity, then the size of the pool is the maximum
        number of successes that may be purchased. The successes
        must be purchased separately for each dodge
        attempt, so a Lunar whose player sought to gain five
        automatic successes on each of three dodge attempts in
        the same turn would spend a total of 15 motes. A Lunar
        rendered immobile by terrain, magic or other effects
        gains no advantage from Bending Before the Storm and
        must rely on parry or soak to avoid the attack.

        Prerequisite Charms: Bending Before the Storm&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Simply dodging an attack may not be enough to save
        an Exalt from harm â€” his opponent may have multiple
        actions and may keep attacking until the character's
        defenses fail. Using the Wind-Dancing Method, a Lunar
        can use his agility to both avoid an attack and make
        it much harder for an opponent to press her advantage.
        By using this Charm, when dodging, if he
        succeeds in dodging an attack, the Lunar can move
        up to eight yards from the opponent as a reflexive part
        of the dodge action, even if the Lunar has already
        moved this turn. In hand-to-hand combat, this means
        the opponent must herself move or use some reach-
        extending magic if she wishes to attack again. If the
        attacker cannot reach the Lunar for her next attack,
        she may make no further attacks against the Lunar
        this turn. A Lunar who is attacked repeatedly can
        activate this Charm after each attack and continue
        moving away from the attacker, hoping to exhaust
        her movement. Note that this Charm does not allow
        the Lunar to take a dodge action if he could not
        normally do so - Lunars wishing to defend themselves
        without splitting their dice pools or going full
        dodge will have to put this Charm in a Combo.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By locking his eyes with his attacker and activating
        this Charm, the Lunar may distract his opponent
        and cause the attack to go wide. The attacker must be
        within a number of yards equal to (5 x the target's
        Perception) for the Charm to be effective - the
        opponent needs to be able to see the Lunar's eyes for
        them to distract him. If the attacker does no use her
        visual senses â€” for example, if she is blind or blind-folded
        â€” then the Charm is wasted. If the victim is
        deliberately avoiding the Lunar's gaze, this increases
        the difficulty of all actions involving the Lunar (including
        attack and defense rolls) by 2, and the
        avoidance must be declared before the Charm is
        activated. Once stung, the opponent may begin avoiding
        the Lunar's gaze, but the target cannot suddenly
        decide to begin when the Lunar activates this Charm.
        If the Charm takes effect, the attacker is momentarily
        confused as to the Lunar's position, and the
        Lunar may add a number of dice to his dodge pool
        equal to his Charisma. These are not Dexterity bonus
        dice, they are Charisma dice, and thus, they circumvent
        the normal ceiling on dodge bonus dice.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Dodges usually require the defender to maneuver
        and are thus impossible if the character cannot give
        ground. Using the Unmoving Bear Defense, a Lunar
        Exalted can dodge attacks without moving, instead using
        his protean abilities to twist and deform his body to avoid
        the attacks. The Lunar must be conscious and able to
        maneuver to use this Charm, though he does not need to
        actually move his feet. When dodging, he may add his
        Essence to his dodge pool. If the character has no dodge
        action, he may use his Essence as his dice pool in a dodge
        attempt. This Charm is not compatible with other Charms
        that add dice to the character's dodge attempts but does
        not preclude Charms that allow dodge attempts at the
        character's full dice pool.

        If, during hand-to-hand combat, an opponent seeks
        to move away from the Lunar, he may activate this
        Charm to hinder the move. The opponent's player
        makes a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics roll against a
        difficulty equal to the Lunar's Dexterity. If the opponent
        succeeds, she may move as intended; otherwise, she must
        remain in the same position. This can stop Charm-powered
        escapes such as the Lunar Charm Wind-Dancing
        Method and the Terrestrial Hopping Firecracker Evasion
        and even a high-speed flyby attacks such as the Solar
        Eagle-Wing Style.

        &lt;br&gt;
        For a dodge to be effective, the character must be
        able to move away from the source of possible injury.
        Most attacks â€” a fist, a sword, an arrow â€” are concentrated
        on a single point and are, thus, avoidable, but not
        all attacks are. Some attacks are so magically enhanced
        they are unavoidable, while others affect an area, perhaps
        encompassing sufficient space that a character
        doesn't have the speed to get clear before the blow lands.
        In such cases, the character would ordinarily be unable
        to dodge avoid the attack. However, a Lunar who knows
        Flowing Body Evasion may attempt to cheat fate, using
        speed, agility and his shapeshifting nature to avoid harm.
        The exact method will vary â€” perhaps the Lunar puts on
        a burst of speed, dodges with godlike agility or squeezes
        into a tiny hole â€” but the end result is the same; a nearly
        perfect dodge. Properly used, this technique provides a
        nearly impenetrable defense.&lt;br&gt;
        When the Lunar activates this Charm, his player
        must make a reflexive Dexterity + Dodge roll. If the
        player gets at least one success, the Exalt avoids the
        attack totally. If the roll fails, the attack affects the Lunar
        normally. This is a dodge action, so a Lunar who fails to
        dodge with this Charm cannot attempt to make an
        &amp;quot;actual&amp;quot; dodge roll for the turn. This Charm cannot be
        placed in a Combo with any Charm that would cause the
        Lunar's player to automatically succeed on the Dexterity
        + Dodge roll. A Lunar can only use this Charm before he
        takes his action for the turn â€” he may postpone his
        action, but once he acts, he is unable to invoke Flowing
        Body Evasion.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can use his preternatural
        abilities to help defend his associates. If an ally is attacked,
        the Lunar may abort his action and seek to wrest
        the friend out of harm's way. The associate must be
        within a number of yards equal to the Lunar's Dexterity
        for him to be able to use the Charm, and the Lunar must
        pay the Essence cost as soon as his player declares the
        action. The Essence cost is usually 3 motes per attempt,
        but if the ally is bound to the Lunar by the Charm
        Brotherhood of Lake and River, the cost is only 2 motes.
        The Lunar's player makes a Dexterity + Dodge roll, and
        if the player rolls but a single success, the original target
        avoids taking damage from the attack. The Lunar takes
        the attack instead, with the dodge roll applied as a
        normal defense. If the roll botches, both the Lunar and
        the target take the attack, and neither can make any
        further defense against it. Lunars may use this Charm
        more than once in a turn, but it must be used before they
        take their action for the turn. The Lunar can postpone
        his action, but once he has made his dice action, he can
        no longer use this Charm. The shielded character cannot
        decline the effects of this Charm.

        Using a mix of Dexterity, shapeshifting and illusion to
        confuse his opponent, a Lunar can employ this Charm to
        mislead an opponent into attacking the wrong person. To
        use this Charm, the Lunar must be in close proximity to his
        intended target (who must be less than the Lunar's Dexterity
        in yards away). The Lunar spends the Essence to activate
        the Charm, then his player reflexively rolls the Exalt's
        Dexterity + Dodge. For the Charm to take effect, the
        Lunar's player must get as many successes as the attacker's
        Perception. If the Lunar succeeds, the Lunar avoids damage,
        and the new target is subject to the attack. The new
        target may attempt to parry or dodge as normal if she has
        actions available. If the redirection attempt fails, the Lunar
        takes damage normally â€” he sacrificed his dodge attempt in
        the redirection effort. This Charm cannot be used to avoid
        counterattacks, nor is it compatible with Charms that cause
        the Lunar to gain automatic dodge successes.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar's skin thickens and
        strengthens, providing the Lunar with additional soak
        against bashing damage. When this Charm is invoked,
        or as a simple action at any time later in the
        scene, the Lunar's player may purchase bonus points of
        bashing soak for his character. A player cannot purchase
        more points of bashing soak than his character
        has dots of Stamina. The player must purchase at least
        one point when the Charm is activated. The Lunar's
        outward appearance is largely unchanged, though
        closer examination will show the modifications to his
        hide. The character can wear armor as normal while
        under the effects of this Charm. The Lunar's bashing
        soak cannot be raised above 12 by the combined
        effects of this Charm and Deadly Beastman
        Transformation's gifts and effects on the character's
        Stamina. Instead, the character may ignore bashing
        attacks that do less raw damage less than the difference
        between 12 and what the character's soak would
        be without the limit. A character may never ignore
        attacks doing more than 12 points of raw damage,
        regardless of what his soak should be.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Armor-Forming Technique creates bony plates
        in the Exalt's body and limbs and hides vital organs
        behind multiple sheets of moonsilver-laced bone. These
        defenses allow the character to bolster his resistance to
        even lethal damage. The bone grows up and around the
        character's armor, sealing his weak points and reinforcing
        his armor's strength. Thus, this Charm is compatible
        with the use of armor. When this Charm is invoked or at
        any time thereafter during the scene, the player may
        spend motes of Essence to purchase extra soak against
        lethal damage for his character. The player must pur-
        chase at least one point when the Charm is activated.
        The maximum number of points of soak the player can
        purchase is equal to half (round down, minimum of 1) his
        character's Stamina Attribute.&lt;br&gt;
        Unlike the Hide-Toughening Essence, the changes
        wrought by the Armor-Forming Technique are pro-
        found and immediately obvious to any observers.
        Furthermore, each point purchased with the Charm
        reduces the Lunar's Appearance by 1 (to a minimum of
        0, at which point the character is hideous to behold).
        The Lunar's lethal soak cannot be raised above 12 by
        the combined effects of this Charm and Deadly
        Beastman Transformation's gifts and effects on the
        character's Stamina. Instead, the character may ignore
        bashing attacks that do less raw damage less than the
        difference between 12 and what the character's soak
        would be without the limit. A character may never
        ignore attacks doing more than 12 points of raw dam-
        age, regardless of what his soak should be.

        Using this Charm, the Lunar causes a large bony
        growth to appear on one of his arms (usually the off
        hand). He can use this &amp;quot;shield&amp;quot; to protect his body from
        hand-to-hand and ranged attacks alike, gaining the
        benefits of a target shield, automatically reducing attackers'
        success dice by one. The Lunar does not suffer
        a mobility penalty for using Limb-Shielding Growth,
        nor does it add to his fatigue value, but any attacks
        made using the hand upon which the shield has grown
        are at - 1 dice.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can transform his skin
        to resemble the hide of a ferocious Celestial dragon. His
        body is covered with a series of overlapping moonsilver-reinforced
        scales that glisten coldly in the light and
        provide formidable protection against all forms of attack.
        It is as if the character is swathed in articulated
        plate armor, and the Lunar gains a +9L/+9B soak
        bonus, while incurring only a - 1 mobility penalty. The
        armor has no fatigue value, and it is not counted as
        armor for the purposes of attacks that ignore armor, but
        it does count as armor for the purposes of stopping
        aggravated attacks.&lt;br&gt;
        Unlike the other armor-enhancing Charms known
        to the Lunar Exalted, Scales of the Dragon is not
        compatible with the use of armor. However, the Lunar's
        player continues to add his character's Stamina (or one
        half Stamina against lethal damage) to the character's
        soak. The Lunar still gains the benefits of a shield (if
        carried) and can reinforce his defense with Hide-
        Toughening Technique and Armor-Forming Style. No
        combination of this Charm, those two Charms or the
        effects of Deadly Beastman Transformation can increase
        either of the character's natural soaks above 12.
        If the character's soak would rise above 12, then the
        character will ignore attacks that have a raw damage
        less than the difference between 12 and what the
        Lunar's soak should be, to a maximum of 12.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By activating this Charm, the Lunar shields
        herself in a carapace of moonsilver, which appears to
        flow out of her pores to completely cover her body in
        shimmering plates. There are no gaps or weak points
        in this armor, which glistens fluidly as the Lunar
        moves. Though appearing to be liquid, the Invulnerable
        Moonsilver Carapace is nigh invulnerable to
        any form of attack. It adds 15B/15L to the Lunar's
        soak until the end of the turn. This soak stacks with
        armor and cannot be circumvented by any stratagem,
        Charm or sorcery (this is a perfect effect) and is not
        armor for the purposes of Charms that do not stack
        with armor. Its Essence cost is, however, crippling.
        During turns when the Invulnerable Moonsilver
        Carapace is activated, the Lunar suffers a -3 penalty
        to her Dexterity and Perception, though this cannot
        reduce the Attributes below 1.

        A Lunar's ties to the wild allow him to survive in
        conditions where others would suffer great hardship. By
        using this Charm, the Lunar taps into his bestial nature,
        using instinct and cunning rather than rational thought
        to guide his actions. When attempting any form of
        Survival roll that involves Wits, the Lunar's player may
        purchase additional dice up to his character's unmodified
        Wits score.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar replicates the breath
        control of a diving whale and need not breath for a
        considerable period of time (Stamina x 10 minutes). The
        Lunar can survive underwater, in poison gas or even
        where there's no air at all. However, the Lunar cannot
        speak without compromising the effects of the Charm â€”
        doing so requires him to expel air from his lungs. The
        Lunar may speak a few words, perhaps a short sentence,
        but if he does so, the duration of the Charm decreases to
        one minute. If he speaks a longer sentence or speaks
        again, the duration decreases to five turns. A third
        attempt at speech or any form of longer communication
        cancels the Charm. As part of activating the Charm, the
        Lunar must take a deep breath and so cannot simply
        reactivate it in hostile conditions.

        By activating this Charm, the Lunar protects himself
        from cold conditions. The exact method differs from
        Lunar to Lunar â€” some may grow a layer of blubber,
        others a pelt of warm fur. Regardless, the effects are the
        same. For the duration of the Charm, the Lunar can exist
        in relative comfort even in the coldest conditions. He
        does not suffer from hypothermia, frostbite or immersion,
        nor does he suffer the effects of snow blindness.
        He is not, however, protected from the harshest
        rigors of the Elemental Poles, nor from magically
        conjured cold.

        This Charm has the opposite effect of Sealskin
        Endurance, resulting in a lean, sleek Lunar adapted to
        the rigors of warm environments. His body becomes
        highly efficient at conserving water and adept at
        radiating excess heat without the need for sweating.
        For the duration of the Charm, the Lunar can exist in
        relative comfort in even the warmest conditions. He
        does not suffer heatstroke or sand blindness, nor does
        his skin blister and burn after exposure to the sun. The
        Heat Adapting Method does not protect the Lunar
        from the effects of fire.

        through flames and across burning coals without
        suffering ill effects. He is not, however, immune to
        the effects of prolonged heat. The character adds his
        Essence to his soak against magical fire. While under
        the protection of this Charm, the character is also
        immune to the effects of smoke inhalation and to
        overheating caused by exposure to flames.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can unerringly find
        shelter for himself and a number of associates. The
        exact sort of shelter will depend on the environment
        â€” in rocky terrain, the Lunar's senses may lead him
        to a cave or cleft, while, in a forest, he may divine a
        hollow tree of suitable size. The Lunar's player makes
        a Perception + Survival roll, each success indicating
        capacity for one person, irrespective of the environmental
        conditions. However, this protection merely shields
        the characters from the elements â€” it does not guarantee
        there is firewood or food in the vicinity.

        By using this Charm, a Lunar will never go hungry.
        If he is traveling during the day in hospitable terrain,
        the Lunar is guaranteed to find enough nuts, berries,
        ants and fungi to keep him well fed. If he actively
        forages for food (see Exalted, p. 245), he may gather
        sufficient food to feed a number of people equal to his
        Perception + Survival, though doing so will take
        approximately an hour of his time. In harsher environments,
        the Lunar is still able to feed himself, though
        the Storyteller may wish the Lunar's player to roll his
        character's Perception + Survival, perhaps even at an
        increased difficulty level, to determine how many
        people he can feed. In no case should the difficulty
        increase above 3 unless the Lunar is stranded on pack
        ice, in the midst of a vast loose-sand desert or in some
        other wildly hostile environment.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can find sufficient water
        to meet his needs for a day. This moisture may be from
        concealed springs, condensation on leaves or the pulp of
        vegetation. Lunars in dire straits have gathered the film of
        moisture from around individual grains of sand, so sensitive
        are their tongues. If the Exalt seeks water for others,
        he may gather sufficient moisture to meet the needs of a
        number of people equal to his Perception + Survival,
        though harsh conditions may require his player to roll
        against a difficulty depending on the circumstances, each
        success indicating sufficient water for a person. Finding
        water takes 30 minutes per person (including the Lunar),
        and as with the Food-Scenting Method above, the difficulty
        of the roll to find water should never rise above 3.

        Many wild beasts can go for days without nourishment,
        and the Wolf Endurance Method allows the Lunar
        Exalted to do likewise. On a day that the Charm is active,
        the Lunar does not need to eat or drink and does not
        suffer any hunger pangs. Unfortunately, while Essence
        can support the body for a short while, it is very inefficient
        at powering the metabolism of an Exalted. As a
        result, the Wolf Endurance Method can be used for a
        number of weeks equal to the character's Stamina. After
        that point, the Lunar must temporarily loose a point of
        Strength or Stamina for each additional week. Attribute
        points lost in this manner cannot be recovered until the
        Charm is discontinued and the character has had several
        square and nutritious meals.

        By activating this Charm, the Lunar can place
        himself in a deep sleep, during which time he need not
        eat and drink. Instead, Essence and body fat reserves
        sustain the Lunar. The character may place himself in
        this hibernation for a number of months up to his
        Stamina score, paying 3 motes of Essence and 1 point of
        temporary Stamina to maintain his body during this
        time. However long he sleeps, the Lunar will be ravenous
        upon waking. The Lunar must have a solid meal within
        24 hours of waking, or else, he loses an additional point
        of Stamina each day until he does. The Wolf Endurance
        Method cannot offset this Stamina loss â€” after hibernating,
        the Lunar is beyond mere hunger. If his Stamina
        declines to 0, the Lunar dies. Every day after waking
        during which he eats properly allows the character to
        recover one of the points of Stamina (including the one
        spent when activating the Charm).

        Constant activity places a great strain on the body,
        and even Exalts become fatigued after prolonged activity.
        By using Fortitude of the Aurochs, a Lunar can
        reinvigorate his body with Essence, manipulating the
        muscles and blood of his body to allow him to remain
        active. With this Charm in use, a Lunar can work for 24
        hours without worry of fatigue, nor can he become
        fatigued as a result of Charms, sorcery or other effects.
        Fortitude of the Aurochs does not eliminate any penalties
        already in effect as a result of fatigue, nor does it
        negate the need for sleep, only weariness from labor.
        Fortitude of the Aurochs also negates the need to make
        fatigue rolls for wearing armor, irrespective of environmental
        conditions.

        By using Essence to reinvigorate his limbs, a Lunar
        can go for 24 hours without sleep and suffer no penalties
        (see Exalted, p. 241, for the normal penalties). He
        remains fully alert during this time and can keep acting,
        though the Charm does nothing to alleviate the symptoms
        of fatigue. The character can activate this Charm
        every day, but doing so for a prolonged period of time is
        not recommended â€” after a number of days equal to the
        character's Stamina, Essence alone is not sufficient to
        reinvigorate the Lunar. Each day thereafter, he must also
        spend a temporary Willpower, which he cannot recover
        without a prolonged period of sleep. After the Charm is
        discontinued, the Lunar must sleep for six hours for each
        day he was awake.

        By calling on Luna's Fortitude, a Lunar ignores all
        wounds, period. Any wounds already present remain,
        and he may sustain new ones, but he suffers no action
        penalties while the Charm is in effect and is not rendered
        unconscious (or killed) no matter how far past incapacitated
        his injuries would take him. A character may
        sustain use of this Charm for a number of turns equal to
        his Stamina but must pay for the Charm in each turn.
        When the Charm ends, all wound effects immediately
        come into play; if the Lunar has suffered more points of
        lethal damage than he has health levels (including the

        Stamina), he dies immediately.

        Though diseases and infections are rarely a problem
        for the Exalted, the harsh lifestyles of the Lunar Exalted
        expose them to a wide range of contagions, and so, they
        have learned to use Essence to fortify their metabolisms.
        When making a roll to resist disease or infection, the
        Lunar's player may activate this Charm to convert
        Stamina dice into automatic successes. He may convert
        as many dice into successes as the Lunar has points of
        Stamina. The Infection-Resisting Method only helps to
        avoid disease; it does not help resist or to cure disease
        once the Lunar has become infected.

        Exalted is able to quickly deal with cuts and other
        wounds, causing the flesh around gashes to flow together
        and broken bones to magically reknit. The Exalt may
        spend 2 motes to transform a level of lethal damage into
        bashing damage. A Lunar cannot heal more lethal damage
        in a turn than he has points of Stamina. In addition,
        if even one health level is healed, any bleeding wounds
        automatically close, preventing the loss of further health
        levels. The Lunar does not have to repair all of his lethal
        damage with this Charm â€” he may leave some to heal

        By infusing his hands with Essence and touching a
        subject's wounds, a Lunar is able to heal or alleviate those
        wounds. These healing hands can remove bashing damage
        and transform lethal wounds into bashing. Mother's
        Touch also closes bleeding wounds, preventing the loss
        of additional health levels. Each level of bashing damage
        healed costs 2 motes of Essence, while each level of lethal
        transformed costs 3 motes. Mother's Touch can be used
        to transform aggravated damage (into lethal), but each
        health level removed costs 3 motes and a temporary
        Willpower point. With each use of Mother's Touch, the
        Lunar may transform/cure as many levels of damage as he
        has points of Stamina.

        Using this Charm, the Lunar can heighten all of his
        senses far beyond those of normal humans. His ears grow
        to better hear sound, his nostrils flare to enhance his
        ability to smell, and his eyes grow and dilate to enhance
        his sight â€” he can even taste individual ingredients in a
        meal and feel the slightest wind on his skin. For the
        duration of the Charm, the Lunar's player adds bonus
        dice equal to the amount of Essence spent to Perception
        rolls. He may not increase the character's pool by more
        dice through this Charm than the Lunar has dots of
        Perception. This enhancement, though powered by Essence,
        does not grant the Lunar supernatural powers â€”
        it merely enhances his mortal senses.

        This Charm is actually three different Charms,
        one each for sight, for scent and taste and for hearing
        and touch. Through it, the Lunar can hone his senses
        far beyond those of most animals. When making a
        Perception test with the heightened sense, the Lunar's
        Perception dice are automatically successes, and the
        Lunar's player need only roll the character's Ability
        dice (usually Awareness or Survival). Charms that
        reduce successes in Perception tests affect these automatic
        successes normally. The Charm must be purchased
        separately for each of the three sense groups
        and only provides a bonus when used in conjunction
        with that sense group. A Lunar may use a maximum of
        two Heightened (Sense) Charms at any time. If he
        wishes to enhance a third, he must cease using the
        Charm on one of the already-heightened senses.
        Heightened (Sense) Method Charms may not be used
        at the same time as the Sense-Sharpening Change or
        any other Charm that boosts the Lunar's Perception,
        though they may be used in conjunction with sense-
        enhancing Charms that do not directly enhance the
        Perception Trait, such as Night Is Day.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can attach his perceptions
        to the senses of another human or an animal. The
        Lunar must touch the target when activating the Charm,
        but once it is functioning, the subject may travel up to
        a mile from the Lunar per point of the Exalt's permanent
        Essence and still serve as a source of sensory
        information. If the subject is willing, no roll is required
        to activate the Charm. Otherwise, the Lunar's player
        must make a Wits + Awareness roll, with a difficulty
        equal to the target's Essence. Animals of the Lunar's
        totem species are automatically willing, while other
        animals are not unless charmed or befriended. To
        succeed, the Lunar's player must roll a number of
        successes equal to or exceeding the target's Essence.
        Otherwise, the Charm fails, and if the target is an Exalt
        or other supernatural creature, he knows the Lunar
        attempted to use a Charm on him. Mortals and mortal
        beasts cannot detect the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        While the Charm is active, the Lunar senses
        everything his subject does. For all intents and pur-
        poses, the subject becomes the Lunar's eyes and ears.
        The Lunar has some semblance of his own senses, but
        borrowed senses dominate his perceptions. Any ac-
        tions taken by the Lunar while the Sense-Borrowing
        Method is being used â€” including reflexive actions â€”
        are at +2 difficulty. As a consequence, most Lunars
        simply meditate while using the Charm. If the either
        the Lunar or his subject sustain an injury (at least one
        health level of damage), the Charm ends. This Charm
        gives the Lunar no control over the creature, he
        simply shares its senses.

        Lunars are very aware of their environments and,
        thus, very difficult to ambush. When the character is
        attacked from surprise, the Lunar may choose to activate
        this Charm automatically if the character has sufficient
        Essence to power it. When it does activate, the Lunar's
        player's reflexive Perception + Awareness roll to avoid
        being ambushed (see Exalted, p. 238) gains a number of
        bonus dice equal to the Lunar's Perception.

        This reflexive Charm allows a Lunar to know if he is
        being watched, either by normal senses or magic. It activates
        automatically if the Lunar comes under sustained
        observation â€” a casual glance or a flirtatious look are not
        enough to trigger it. The Charm guides his perceptions to
        gather further information, allowing a reflexive Perception
        + Awareness roll. The number of successes determines
        the information gathered. A single success merely confirms
        that the Lunar is being observed, while additional
        successes will pinpoint the number and direction of observers
        (one per success). A Lunar observed by magical
        means will know the viewpoint from which he is being
        watched but not the actual location of the observer.

        Lunars with this Charm can track and predict the
        weather, using Essence to build on and extend their
        natural perceptions. The number of successes from a
        Wits + Survival roll determines the scope of information
        a Lunar can divine. Each success garners him either
        knowledge of conditions within a 10-mile radius or for
        the next day (cumulative). A Lunar may purchase information
        on both area and time, but he must do so in as
        even a manner as possible. For example, a Lunar who gets
        4 successes cannot purchase information on a 40-mile
        radius or about a 10-mile radius for 4 days in advance, but
        rather learns about a 20-mile radius for two days in
        advance. If there are an odd number of successes, the
        Lunar's player may choose which aspect has the additional
        die. The Weather-Scenting Method may not be
        used to predict future conditions under the influence of
        magic, though it may be used to gather information on
        the prevailing conditions when the Charm is activated.

        After activating this Charm, the Lunar instinctively
        knows the direction of the Imperial Mountain.
        This works irrespective of the Lunar's situation â€” it is as
        effective inside a building or underground as it is in
        plains or forest â€” and works as well in darkness as in
        daylight. If the Lunar simply desires to know the direction
        of the Imperial Mountain, no roll is required
        However, he may also use this Charm to identify his
        location, though this requires a Wits + Awareness roll,
        the number of successes indicating the precision of the
        information. One success gives him little more than
        what he already knows, three successes allows him to
        narrow his location down to the county or district, and
        five or more let him know precisely where he stands.

        The Moonsilver-Scenting Sense hones the Lunar's
        olfactory nerves, allowing her to scent deposits of
        moonsilver in the surrounding lands or moonsilver weapons
        not attuned to a Lunar. The Lunar's player must make
        a Wits + Awareness roll, the number of successes determining
        what â€” if anything â€” the character learns of the
        moonsilver deposits and unattuned items in the region.
        One success allows the Lunar to ascertain whether there
        is any moonsilver within a number of miles equal to the
        Lunar's Perception + Essence. Three successes also pro-
        vide a direction and approximate distance. Five or more
        successes allow the Lunar to judge the quality and condition
        (e.g., concealed by Dragon-Blooded machinations)
        of the deposits or items. The Lunar's player may make one
        roll for every 10 minutes that the Charm is active.

        Having existed on the edge of the world, Lunar Exalted
        are ever watchful for the warping effects of the Wyld.
        Though their nature and their tattoos protect them from
        its deforming effects, their associates and non-Lunar kin
        are less fortunate, and their gear is often vulnerable as well.
        Provided the Lunar has sufficient motes available, Wyld-Sensing
        Instincts activates reflexively to alert the Lunar to
        these malign changes. Immediately after it does, the Lunar's
        player may make a (non-reflexive) Perception + Survival
        roll. The number of successes indicates the amount of time
        the Lunar has to act before changes occur. One success
        gives the Lunar a few turns to escape the transformations,
        while three successes indicates he has several minutes to
        reach safety. Five or more successes indicate that, while
        approaching dangerous levels, the chaos is not yet sufficient
        to warp items, and he has as much as 30 minutes to
        seek refuge â€” or to otherwise protect â€” his associates.

        cannot replace these powers, it can provide sanctuary
        from the effects of the Wyld for a time. The use of this
        Charm requires that the Lunar first pace out the area she
        wishes to protect, encircling it with her scent and
        presence; this area can be no larger than a number of
        square miles equal to her permanent Essence. Once this
        is done, she uses the Charm, and her player rolls Wits +
        Lore. For every three successes scored, the level of the
        Wyld in the area protected is reduced by one (so if she
        scored six successes, she would reduce an area of Deep
        Wyld down in intensity to be equivalent to
        Bordermarches). This effect lasts a number of weeks
        equal to her permanent Essence.

        and does not suffer penalties for being caught unawares
        by visible attacks. However, comprehending such a vista
        forces the Lunar to focus on the &amp;quot;big picture&amp;quot; rather than
        the details and, as a result, increases by 1 the difficulty of
        any Perception rolls involving spotting details.

        Night Is Day does not allow the Lunar to see in absolute
        darkness â€” there must be some light, even if just a

        Some animals can see light incomprehensible to
        humans, most often the spectral glows of heat and cold.
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can do likewise, allowing him
        to perceive radiated heat and other forms of light normally
        beyond his experience. This allows him to see in
        perfect darkness, though his ability to distinguish detail
        is greatly impaired (+2 difficulty to all Perception rolls
        involving discerning fine detail).

        This Charm allows a Lunar to understand - in
        general terms if not the exact meaning of words â€” any
        language spoken in his presence. The Lunar's player
        must roll Wits + Linguistics, with the number of successes
        indicating the level of comprehension. One success
        allows him to get the general gist of what's being said,
        while three successes afford solid comprehension. Five or
        more successes allow the Lunar to discern nuances in
        what has been said, be they insults or flattery. The
        Comprehending Ears Meditation does not allow the
        Lunar to speak in a foreign tongue. Comprehending Ears
        Meditation does not allow the Lunar to understand
        nonverbal communication.

        By activating this Charm, a Lunar can attempt to
        both understand and speak any language or dialect
        known by people he has consumed. The Lunar's player
        makes a Wits + Linguistics roll when the Lunar activates
        the Charm. The difficulty is 5 - (the number of people
        who spoke the language the Lunar has eaten the heart's
        blood of). The number of successes on the roll determines
        the Lunar's level of comprehension and fluency.
        One success indicates linguistic abilities comparable
        with a young child, while three successes denote average
        adult abilities. Five or more successes grant the skills of
        a poet. Calls of the Human Prey does not allow the Lunar
        to read or write the language, nor does it make her a
        perfect mimic. If the Lunar has eaten only a few victims
        fluent in a single language, his voice may possess a
        distinct accent that damages his ability to socialize with
        those who dislike his dialect.

        This Charm allows a Lunar to understand and communicate
        with â€” in general if not in precise terms â€” any
        animals in his presence. It functions as per the Comprehending
        Ears Meditation, save with regard to its subjects.
        The Lunar's player makes a Wits + Linguistics roll when
        the Lunar activates the Charm, with a difficulty of 5 -
        (the number of beasts of that species the Lunar has eaten
        the heart's blood of). The Lunar need get only one
        success in most cases, as natural animals are not generally
        articulate. However, if the animal is a complex thinker
        normally unable to communicate, then more successes
        may be relevant. A Lunar using this Charm can automatically
        understand the language of his totem animal
        form (no roll needed).

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm â€” which, in any form, causes his
        ears to enlarge and resemble those of a rabbit or stiff-eared
        dog â€” a Lunar can use his enhanced hearing to
        keep track of others in his immediate vicinity without
        needing to have them in sight. He is dimly aware of the
        others' presence and may reach out with his senses to
        pinpoint them and provide extra information. Doing so
        requires a Perception + Awareness roll, difficulty 1 in
        wilderness conditions, 2 in the streets of a town and 3
        inside a structure. One success indicates that the Lunar
        is aware of those around him, but only in a general sense,
        while three successes provide him with an approximate
        direction and range to each. Five or more successes allow
        the Lunar to pinpoint the others and also provide information
        on their activities, equipment carried and
        movement. The Lunar may use this Charm to track a
        number of others equal to (his Essence x 5) and may
        perceive them out to (his Perception x 100) yards.
        Unless concealed by Charms, those closest to the Lunar
        are revealed first, and those furthest from him last. A
        Storyteller may, at his discretion, identify more distant
        targets first if they are somehow &amp;quot;broadcasting&amp;quot; their
        presence by making lots of noise.

        Prerequisite Charms: Rabbit Ear Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        By focusing his hearing, a Lunar can build a mental
        picture of the surrounding area. Unlike the Rabbit Ear
        Method, which only tracks individuals, Seeing Without
        Looking also allows the Lunar to build up an idea of the
        objects and materials that make up the environs by
        analyzing subtle alterations in the sound of echoes.&lt;br&gt;
        Analyzing the sounds he hears takes the Lunar five
        turns, during which time he may move about at a
        walking pace but cannot take any other actions. If he
        does, the Charm fails. After five turns have elapsed, the
        Exalt's player makes a Perception + Awareness roll.
        The number of successes on this roll determines the
        quality of the Lunar's mental picture and the range to
        which the sense applies.&lt;br&gt;
        One success indicates that the Lunar has a general
        picture of the surroundings, including the position of
        people, beasts and major obstacles. However, he knows
        little about their composition and size and cannot tell
        the difference between two small objects placed close
        together. Three successes let the Lunar refine his
        search, allowing him to identify the materials and
        giving him a finer &amp;quot;resolution&amp;quot; in his mind. Five or
        more successes allow the Lunar to identify most details
        in his immediate area, save those that can only be
        gleaned by sight (such as color). With five successes,
        the Lunar can also identify hidden people and items in
        the vicinity, even if Charms were used as part of the
        concealment process. The Lunar's mental picture extends
        a number of yards equal to (the number of
        successes on the Perception roll x 5). Provided he
        maintains the Charm and carries out no actions other
        than walking, the mental image remains current. However,
        as soon as he carries out a dice action or ceases to
        spend Essence, the picture &amp;quot;locks&amp;quot; though the Lunar
        may still act on the details for the remainder of the
        scene. Thus, a Lunar who wishes to fight blind will
        need to use this Charm to build up a picture of his
        surroundings and Rabbit Ear Method to sense his foes.
        However, such a Lunar might be deceived by sliding
        walls, silently opening pits or other changes that make
        the static picture of his environment obsolete.

        player may make a Perception + Awareness roll when
        the character targets the Blood-Kin Sense on an individual.
        If the player gets at least one success, the Lunar
        knows if the person is related to someone else the Lunar
        is familiar with, while three successes give some indication
        of the relationship. Five or more successes allow
        the Lunar to sense firm details of the subjects lineage,
        including a capsule history of the being's ancestor's
        physical abilities for a number of generations back
        equal to the Lunar's Essence. The Blood-Kin Sense
        assumes the Lunar is using scent to study his subject. If
        the Lunar tastes the target's blood, his player gains
        three bonus dice for the roll.

        By means of the Charm, a Lunar can track an
        opponent (or opponents) through almost any terrain.
        To the Lunar, the trail is as clear on solid stone as it is
        in the woodlands or on soft ground. When making a
        tracking roll (Perception + Survival) for the Lunar, her
        player need roll only a single success for the character to
        follow any mundane prey. Furthermore, if the Lunar is
        in beastman form when using this Charm, he is considered
        to be a supernatural tracker, can automatically
        track any mortal target and has a number of automatic
        successes in the tracking contest against other super-
        natural trackers equal to his Essence.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can sense the emotional
        state of her subject, even if there are no outward signs.
        Even if the target appears perfectly calm, his body scent
        will betray him, allowing the Lunar to clearly scent
        strong emotions such as fear, anger, hate and love. Doing
        this does not require a dice roll, though it does count as
        a dice action. The Charm does not, however, automatically
        divine the cause of this emotion or its focus. To
        divine a deeper understanding of the target, the Lunar's
        player must roll Perception + Investigation, the number
        of successes indicating the degree of information gathered.
        One success merely confirms the initial impression,
        while three successes denote the source, target or object
        causing the emotions. Five or more successes allow the
        Lunar to deduce the reason for the emotion.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By observing subtle physical and chemical responses
        in his subject, a Lunar can determine whether a person
        in his presence is speaking the truth. The Lunar may
        target the Charm at an individual â€” in which case, it
        works automatically â€” or he may use it more generally
        on a body of people. In this latter case, the Lunar's player
        must roll Perception + Investigation, the number of
        successes being the number of people the Exalt can
        successfully observe. The Truth-Scenting Method does
        not detect evasions or statements that twist the truth
        without actually being falsehoods. Furthermore, some
        &amp;quot;truths&amp;quot; are subjective, and it is the target's view, not
        that of the perceiving Lunar, which determines truth.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: If a subject says, &amp;quot;I saw him do it,&amp;quot; when
        he saw no such thing, the Lunar can detect the lie. However,
        the Charm will not detect a lie if the subject states, &amp;quot;No, Janek
        didn't pay me anything&amp;quot; (because Marcos did), as it is an
        evasion, not an outright lie.

        Using this Charm. a Lunar can call on his feral instincts
        to enhance any attempts to hide or use stealth. By
        honing both his senses and his agility, the Lunar exploits all
        cover to the maximum possible extent, avoiding obstacles
        that might alert others to his presence, and moves in such
        a graceful manner as to avoid catching the attention of
        unwary observers. For the rest of the scene, when making a
        roll to move stealthily or to hide, the Lunar's player may add
        as many dice to the character's Stealth pool as the Exalt has
        dots of Dexterity, at a cost of 2 motes per die.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can mimic the skin of the
        chameleon and becomes able to adjust the texture and color
        of his hide to better aid in concealment. The player may
        convert the character's Dexterity into automatic successes.
        For the rest of the scene, as long as the character stays still, he
        may convert a number of dice up to his Dexterity Attribute
        into automatic successes. The character must spend 2 motes
        of Essence when the Charm is activated per dot of Dexterity
        the player wants to convert. If the character moves any
        distance, the Lunar must reflexively spend 2 motes at the end
        of the movement to adapt the camouflage to his new back-
        ground. The Charm's benefits are negated until the character
        pays these 2 motes. The Chameleon Skin Method provides
        the Lunar with no advantage if he is clothed or armored.

        The Object-Concealing Method allows a Lunar
        both to find a suitable place of concealment for an item
        and to enhance its protections against even a deliberate
        search. The Lunar's player rolls Wits + Survival, usually
        against a difficulty of 1 but perhaps higher in terrain with
        very few hiding places. If she succeeds, the Lunar has
        found a place of concealment for the item within (her
        Wits x 10) yards. Furthermore, the number of successes
        are the difficulty of Perception + Investigation rolls of
        others trying to find the object in a deliberate search.
        The object cannot be discovered by accident. It takes
        (10 - the Lunar's Essence) turns to find a hiding place for
        the concealed item.

        Lunar may conceal as many people at once as his
        Essence Trait, each costing 5 motes. A Lunar cannot
        use Ally Concealing Method to hide himself. It takes

        Lunars are crafty in the ways of the wild, adept at
        following â€” or hiding â€” signs of passage. There are
        times, however, when a Lunar wishes to truly disappear,
        throwing even the craftiest pursuers off the
        scent. Traceless Passage Technique allows him to do
        so, concealing evidence of his passage and disguising
        anywhere he rested. Trackers without magical enhancements
        are unable to follow his trail while the
        Charm is active, and those with Charms or sorcery to
        aid their endeavors suffer a difficulty modifier equal to
        the Lunar's Essence. Traceless Passage Technique
        does not provide the automatic successes against
        other Lunars.

        of Traceless Passage Technique to his companions,
        and his instincts help to guide their actions as well as
        his own. Enacting the Charm costs 4 motes, and each
        person encompassed in Track-Sweeping Essence costs
        an additional 2 motes. If the Lunar wants to conceal his
        own passage, he must pay for himself as well. The Lunar
        may conceal the passage of as many people as he has
        points of Essence.

        Lunar society has little in the way of a written
        tradition, instead preferring to pass information down
        orally. Much of the history and many of the traditions of
        the Lunar Exalted take the form of stories â€” some based
        on history, others simply parables â€” and learning how to
        tell a story is an important skill in Lunar society, particularly
        among the No Moons. Much of this is simply
        learned, part of the Performance Ability, but a master
        storyteller knows how to use Essence and his shapeshifting
        powers to enhance the tale. The exact method will
        depend on the audience â€” speaking to youngsters might
        involve lots of noise and action, while, with adults,
        delivery may be a major factor â€” but the Lunar can use
        his abilities to shape his voice and actions accordingly.
        Normally, the Charm affects five subjects, but for each
        additional mote spent, the speaker can increase his
        audience by a further five people. A Lunar with sufficient
        Essence can use Tale-Spinning Mastery to address a
        crowd, though it is an inefficient method.
        While Tale-Spinning Mastery is in effect, the
        Lunar's player can add bonus dice to any test involving
        storytelling, though the bonus may not exceed the
        character's Charisma. The Storyteller may increase the
        difficulty of the roll if the audience is hostile, disinclined
        to listen or otherwise distracted. The audience
        must be able to comprehend the Lunar's speech for the
        Charm to work.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Most Lunars do not believe in writing. Instead,
        their history, traditions and knowledge are conveyed
        orally. Each No Moon teaches the rudiments to the
        youngsters whose bodies he tattoos. By using the Lore-Speaking
        Method, a Lunar can enter a meditative
        trance and search his memories for relevant information.
        The trance lasts for a minimum of 30 minutes, but
        may be extended if he wishes, providing the Lunar
        with additional time to search his memories. At the
        end of the meditation, the Lunar's player makes an
        Intelligence + Wits roll, adding a bonus die for each
        additional 10 minutes the character spent in meditation,
        to a maximum bonus of his dots of Intelligence.
        The difficulty of the roll depends on the nature of the
        information he seeks â€” 1 for routine matters, 3 for
        more obscure facts and 5 for esoteric knowledge the No
        Moon may have mentioned in passing â€” and the net
        successes determine the strength and clarity of the
        recollection. The Storyteller may keep the exact difficulty
        secret, instead telling the Lunar how sure he is of
        the memory. If the Lunar's player rolls no successes or
        if the Exalt is interrupted before 30 minutes have
        elapsed, the Charm fails.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Sometimes, a Lunar has need of information he does
        not know. In routine matters, he can turn to the No
        Moons, who may be able to provide what he needs in
        return for a boon, but even the No Moons are fallible.
        Some information can only be acquired from outside
        sources. A civilized Lunar might trek into the Threshold
        or even the Realm proper in his quest for information.
        Those with closer ties to the Wyld, however, do not allow
        the restrictive trappings of civilization to bind their
        thought patterns and will seek knowledge from their
        ancestors and friendly sprits by means of a vision quest.&lt;br&gt;
        Entering a deep trance, the Lunar allows his mind
        and spirit to wander free, perhaps aided by psychotropic
        fungi or the crushed essence of certain beetles. This
        trance may last for hours or days, and there is no guaran-
        tee of success. The Lunar's mind wanders in search of the
        truth it desires, traversing the landscape of his own
        psyche. He may encounter &amp;quot;spirits,&amp;quot; which are, in fact,
        creations of his mind, guiding him on his quest for divine
        inspiration. The difficulty of the vision quest is knowing
        when to trust his senses and instincts and when to reject
        them; a Lunar in this trance cannot easily distinguish
        between what is a real insight and what is his imagination.
        The Lunar may emerge enlightened, or he may be
        confounded by what he has seen. Indeed, external forces
        aware of the Lunar's endeavor might seek to manipulate
        the quest to their own ends, passing on their interference
        as &amp;quot;divine&amp;quot; inspiration.&lt;br&gt;
        At the end of the vision quest, which lasts a number
        of hours equal to the Lunar's Essence, his player may ask
        a single question and roll Perception + Lore. The difficulty
        of the roll is at the Storyteller's discretion and
        depends on the nature of the information sought. &amp;quot;Routine&amp;quot;
        information requires only a single success, while
        hidden knowledge â€” obscured deliberately or otherwise
        â€” requires at least three successes and possibly
        even five. Irrespective of the size of his dice pool, a Lunar
        may not count more successes than his permanent
        Essence Trait. He must discard any extras. Failing this
        roll can have devastating effects. If the Lunar gets at
        least one success but not enough to succeed, he simply
        wakes none the wiser. Failure, however, leaves the
        Lunar disoriented and forced to soak a number of dice of
        bashing damage equal to his Essence. A botch leaves him
        catatonic for a number of days equal to his Essence and may
        also result in a derangement.

        Using this Charm to expand his lungs and vocal cords,
        a Lunar can transform his normal voice into a formidable
        roar. Anything the Lunar says while the Charm is in effect is
        clearly audible to anyone within a number of yards equal
        to (the Lunar's Essence x 100) and to those with acute hearing
        for twice that distance. A Lunar can also use the Lion
        Roar Method as a pseudo- weapon by roaring at an
        individual within 10 yards. That individual must make a
        reflexive Stamina + Endurance roll against a difficulty
        equal to his own Perception. If the target fails, he temporarily
        loses a point of Perception and must attempt
        to soak a number of levels of bashing damage equal to the
        Lunar's Stamina. The Charm actually changes the
        character's body, and the Essence is committed (and the
        effect available) until the character releases the Essence
        committed to the effect.

        Winds circulate around the world, and while not as
        skilled as the Dragon-Blooded at manipulating the elements,
        some Lunars do know how to call upon the wind
        and use it to convey messages to their allies. Upon
        activating this Charm, the Lunar whispers a few words
        (his Essence score x 5 in words maximum) and names a
        recipient. The Exalt's player then rolls Wits + Linguistics.
        The difficulty of the roll depends on the range to the
        intended recipient; if he is within a 1,000 yards, it is
        difficulty 1, while up to a mile requires two successes.
        Three or more successes allow the message to travel up to
        five miles. The recipient must be known to the Lunar
        and must have spoken to him at some point in the past.
        The target is the only person to hear the message -
        sending messages to multiple recipients requires multiple
        invocations of the Charm.

        Method, River of Words allows messages that are more
        complex, longer distance and multiple recipients. There
        is no range limitation to the message transmission,
        though there may be a delay in delivery dependant on
        the range; it takes one hour for the message to cross 600
        miles. The Storyteller may require a Wits + Performance
        roll to determine the clarity of the message at its destination.
        The maximum number of recipients for a River of
        Words communiquÃ© is equal to the Lunar's Essence, and
        the maximum number of words message may contain is

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Emotion Shaping Technique enhances a Lunar's
        already considerable presence, using a combination of
        charisma, insight and timing to allow the Exalt to manipulate
        the emotional responses of his audience. The
        target must be capable of understanding the Exalt for the
        Charm to function correctly but need not be paying full
        attention to what is being said; the Lunar's words and the
        Charm work on the subconscious as much as on the
        conscious mind. The Lunar's player rolls Manipulation +
        Presence, and each success allows the Lunar to temporarily
        increase or decrease one of the target's Virtues by
        a point. This may not increase the Virtue above 5, nor
        may it reduce it below 1. Additionally, a Virtue may not
        be altered by more than two â€” even under the influence
        of this Charm, a paragon of valor will not become a
        sniveling coward. The Lunar's successes need not, however,
        be applied to the same Virtue or even to the same
        target. Two successes could be applied one to each of two
        Virtues or two to one or even one to a Virtue of one
        character and one to a Virtue of another. However, other
        Charms such as the Crowd-Inciting Method and Courage-Building
        Address are better able to manipulate large
        numbers of people. This power does not work on spirits
        or any sort.

        In broad terms, the Crowd-Inciting Method follows
        the same principals as the Emotion-Shaping
        Technique but is better able to influence large numbers
        of people, albeit in a restricted manner. The Lunar must
        address and be heard by the crowd, his player rolling
        Manipulation + Performance against a difficulty dependant
        on the size of the crowd (difficulty +1 per 50
        people or fraction thereof). If the roll succeeds, the
        player may spend successes to temporarily reduce the
        Temperance or Compassion Virtues of the crowd by a
        maximum of 2 dots each and not below 1 (meaning that
        if the Exalt has more than four successes, they are
        wasted), perhaps making it more amenable to other
        suggestions. A failed roll has no effect, but a botch may
        result in the crowd turning on the speaker.

        that it allows the Lunar to temporarily increase the
        Compassion or Temperance of the crowd by up to 2 dots
        (but not above 5). The base Essence cost is higher than
        for the Crowd-Inciting Method, and the difficulty is + 1
        per 30 people in the crowd â€” it is harder for the Lunar
        to calm a mob than to stir one into action. A failed roll
        has no effect, but a botch may result on the address
        fanning the flames of discontent.

        In battle, numbers are rarely the deciding factor.
        Instead, troop quality is often the key, and courage is the
        cornerstone of troop quality. By means of the Courage-Building
        Address, a Lunar can instill a sense of bravery
        in his troops, increasing their Valor Virtue for the
        duration of the battle by means of an inspirational
        speech (which requires at least five minutes). While the
        Lunar makes the speech, his player should make a Manipulation
        + Performance roll (difficulty 2 if the Lunar
        is the unit commander or another notable individual, 3
        otherwise). For every two successes gained, the Valor of
        the troops temporarily increases by a dot for the duration
        of the battle. A failed roll has no effect, but a botch may
        harm the resolve of the troops. The Courage-Building
        Address cannot be used during a battle.

        Lunars are adept at combat, and they excel on the

        to an enemy and inspirational to their own troops. By
        means of this Charm, a Lunar can influence the performance
        of his troops in a battle. His commands are clearly
        audible to troops within (his Essence x 100) yards, and his
        player gains bonus dice equal to the character's Charisma
        when attempting any rolls involving leadership. Furthermore,
        any friendly troops within (the Lunar's Essence x
        10) yards are immune to any effects that would reduce
        their Willpower or Valor and cannot fail Valor checks.
        Any enemy troops within the same radius increase by l
        the difficulty of resisting intimidation or demoralization.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Insults are part of Lunar combat ritual â€” deriding an
        opponent's reputation is almost as effective a wound as
        that caused by a blade. However, most Lunars are inured
        to the taunts, ignoring them as part of the formalities. By
        means of this Charm, however, the Lunar gains insight
        into what barbs will get under an opponent's skin and
        make her react. The Lunar's player makes a Manipulation
        + Presence roll against a difficulty equal to the
        opponent's Temperance. If the roll succeeds, the target
        may be angered by the comments and fight badly, or he
        may even fly into a howling rage.&lt;br&gt;
        With one or two successes, the target is distracted
        and subtracts one success from all attacks, dodges and
        parries until the end of the next turn. Three or four
        successes indicate the comments have really gotten
        under the opponent's skin. In addition to the previous
        penalties, the target's player's next initiative roll is
        reduced by 3. Five or more successes indicate the target
        goes wild; she may not parry or dodge any attacks, nor
        may she attack anyone other than the Lunar who taunted
        her for the remainder of the battle. However, the target
        is not subject to any initiative or attack roll penalties.
        This Charm may only be used on a single foe. The target
        may use Willpower to offset its effects, each point allow-
        ing her to offset all the taunt-induced penalties for the
        turn. The target must be within (the Lunar's Essence x
        10) yards.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Glib Tongue Technique builds on a Lunar's
        presence, allowing him to persuade an individual to act
        (or not) as the Lunar sees fit. The Lunar's player makes
        a Manipulation + Presence roll with a difficulty equal
        to the target's permanent Essence. The net successes
        determine if the Lunar's manipulation succeeds or not.
        If the Lunar's player rolled one extra success, the
        subject is predisposed to the Exalt's suggestion and will
        likely do as the Lunar desires providing no other influences
        (Charms, other persuasion attempts) come into
        to play. Three additional successes guarantee the
        subject's immunity of mortal persuasion, but she is still
        open to magical manipulations that convince her to do
        other than what the Lunar says. Five or more extra
        successes mean the subject will do as desired and
        cannot be swayed. Furthermore, she will do so as soon
        as possible, even at great risk to herself.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can overwhelm someone
        he is speaking to with his physical presence. Some use
        Essence to modify their size, making themselves physically
        larger, while others take on a more terrifying visage.
        A few are less obvious, simply exuding menace and using
        barely controlled fury to scare the person they are facing.
        When the Lunar makes an intimidation attempt (see
        Exalted, p. 242), his player may purchase additional dice
        up to the Exalt's unmodified Manipulation score.

        effort. When making an intimidation roll, the Lunar's
        player may convert a number of dice up to his character's
        Manipulation Attribute into automatic successes. Fearful
        Lunar Form is as effective against groups as it is against
        individuals; make one roll, and apply it to all who behold
        the Exalt's deadly glory.

        A Lunar may focus his intimidation efforts on a
        single individual, seeking not only to force him into
        submission, but also to shatter his will. If successful, the
        subject's mind will be overwhelmed, perhaps rendering
        him unconscious or causing a derangement but certainly
        damaging his short-term memory. The Lunar's player
        rolls Manipulation + Presence against a difficulty equal
        to the target's Essence. Success indicates that the target
        has forgotten what happened in the last minute and each
        additional success increases this mind-blanking period
        by a minute. Mind-Blanking Fear Technique may only
        be targeted on an individual, and the Lunar employing it
        must be in beastman form.

        Speech is only one method of manipulating others.
        Scent and body language can also play a part, particularly
        in more feral circumstances. A Lunar may attempt to use
        his protean nature to manipulate others by such nonverbal
        means, altering his posture, scent and a host of other
        factors to better influence others. When making a Social
        roll, the Lunar's player may purchase additional dice up
        to his character's Charisma at a cost of 3 motes each.
        Such manipulation only works on targets within a num-
        ber of yards equal to the Lunar's Essence, though they
        need not understand his language (or even be able to
        hear him) to be affected.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can modify the mental
        state of a beast or a group of animals. This may be a
        ravening pack of wolves he seeks to pacify, or it may be
        a skittish packhorse he wants to calm. The difficulty of
        the Manipulation + Survival roll depends on the nature
        of and number of the animals he seeks to influence. One
        success would allow the Lunar to walk past a rabbit
        without causing it to bolt, while three successes would
        hold a ravening pack of wolves in check. Five or more
        successes would cause even the mighty tyrant lizard to
        stand in abeyance. The target animals need not understand
        the words of an Exalt seeking to calm them to be
        affected by the Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can seek to command
        beasts to do his bidding. To do so, his player must make
        a series of Manipulation + Survival rolls over a period
        of several days of game time, during which time the
        Essence must remain committed. If the beasts are already
        friendly to the Lunar, he must accumulate one
        success for each beast he seeks to command, whereas, if
        they are neutral, three successes are needed for each.
        Hostile or fearful beasts cannot be easily commanded
        and must generally be convinced to give the Lunar a
        chance, usually by means of the Beast Calming Method.
        However, if the Lunar gets five successes with this
        Charm, even the most hostile beasts will acknowledge
        the Lunar as their pack-leader. Beasts commanded in
        this way remain loyal to the Lunar for a number of
        months equal to his Essence. After that time, he must
        either rework the Charm or trust to natural friendship.
        The Lunar may command a total number of beasts equal
        to (Charisma + Survival) x 10 via this Charm, though
        he may command more through natural loyalty.&lt;br&gt;
        The cost of this Charm is paid per group of beasts
        (if the beasts are social animals) or against individuals
        (if they are lone animals). If the character spends 1
        experience point when he uses the Charm and uses it
        only on a single creature, then he may spend an
        experience point to increase his Familiar rating with
        that beast by 1. A character cannot get a new familiar
        unless his old one has died and cannot have more than
        one familiar at a time. See the Solar Charm Spirit Tied
        Pet on page 179 of Exalted and the Familiar Background
        on page 143 for details.

        Though Lunars often live and act alone, they can
        form strong friendships and associations, similar to Solar
        Circles, which they call &amp;quot;packs.&amp;quot; This camaraderie is a
        rare gift, but it is not the ultimate expression of a Lunar's
        loyalty. That ultimate expression is the Brotherhood of
        Lake and River, a bond of blood and Essence forged
        between the Lunar and his adopted brother. To partake
        in the Brotherhood of Lake and River, the Lunar and his
        sibling-to-be must cut the palm of their fellow's hands
        and bind the wounds together for at least 10 minutes
        while the Charm is activated. From that point on, the
        Lunar is always dimly aware of his wolf-sibling's direction
        and distance and will know if the other sustains
        serious injury or is killed. When in close proximity â€”
        within 100 yards or so â€” the Lunar may even read his
        wolf-sibling's surface thoughts. If the two have used the
        Charm reciprocally, they may even speak without words
        when within 100 yards of one another. The effects of the
        Charm are permanent and can only be broken by death.
        The maximum number of wolf-siblings a Lunar may
        have is equal to twice his Essence, though only one bond
        is formed with each use of the Charm. If such a packmate
        dies, another may take his place in the Lunar's heart.
        This Charm's effects are not automatically reciprocal.
        To establish a reciprocal link, two Lunars must use the
        Charm on one another.

        A Lunar hunting alone is a fearsome sight. One
        hunting with her associates is a nightmare for her enemies.
        She can exploit the blood and Essence ties to her
        allies, tapping into their senses and battlefield knowl-
        edge to gain a decisive edge. Before rolling initiative
        each turn, the Lunar can activate Blood-Singing Instincts,
        paying motes of Essence up to the number of
        allies present who are wolf-siblings of the Lunar through
        the Charm Brotherhood of Lake and River. Each mote of
        Essence spent in this manner adds 1 to the Lunar's
        player's initiative roll for the turn. Multiple Lunars can
        use one another to increase their initiative, making
        Lunars who hunt as a pack into the deadliest of foes.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By crying into the wind and sounding the Pack-Calling
        Cry, a Lunar uses the blood ties to his wolf-siblings
        in the Brotherhood of Lake and River to summon them
        into his presence. The Lunar may attempt to summon
        any number of those bound to him by the Brotherhood
        of Lake and River, each costing 1 mote of Essence. If
        summoning less than his full pack, the Lunar can select
        which of his packmates receive the summons.&lt;br&gt;
        The call can be heard over any distance, implanting
        the desire to return to the Lunar's presence as soon as
        possible. The wolf-sibling has some leeway in deciding
        how quickly to heed the call (a few minutes if nearby,
        perhaps hours if miles away and days if hundreds or
        thousands of miles distant), but if she seeks to delay
        beyond this time, her player must make a Willpower roll
        against a difficulty equal to the calling Lunar's Charisma.
        Success allows the target to resist the call for the same
        time period again, and if her player is successful a number
        of times (which need not be consecutive) equal to the
        calling Lunar's Essence, the desire to return fades away.
        Failure means the target must immediately break off
        what she is doing and set off toward the caller, though she
        may attempt to resist after each day of travel.

        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; spirits in
        his immediate vicinity, gaining an approximate idea of
        their forms and actions. Provided he is circumspect, and
        no Charms aid the spirit, this observation is undetectable.
        Furthermore, this Charm allows the Lunar to sense
        the true form of a materialized spirit â€” a Lunar will know

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can adapt his senses to
        detect the flows and patterns of Essence in the world
        around him, as well as any dematerialized spirits present.
        The Exalt can instinctively sense the direction and
        strength of flows, as well as the locations and power of
        loci such as Manses and Demesnes. Ascertaining more
        detailed information requires a Perception + Occult
        roll. A single success grants the Lunar basic information
        about the examined Essence, such as identifying
        the nature of a sorcery or the general geomancy of a
        region, while additional successes provide more indepth
        and specific information. For example, three
        successes might allow the Lunar to judge the age and
        other specific details of the sorcery, while, with five
        successes, he may identify the sorcerer by &amp;quot;signature&amp;quot;
        traits. Likewise, three successes provides the sort of
        detailed survey information necessary to construct a
        Manse, while five allows a near-perfect comprehension
        of an area's geomancy.

        Devil-Restraining Grip&lt;br&gt;

        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Wits: 4&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Spirit-Scenting Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Using the Devil-Restraining Grip Charm, a Lunar
        can immobilize a spirit with a snare of Essence,
        binding it to her as if on a leash. If the spirit is
        dematerialized, she can drive it into the material
        world, and once the spirit is in physical form, it is
        prevented from dematerializing. To use this Charm,
        the Exalt's player makes a Manipulation + Occult roll
        against a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence. The
        spirit must be within (the Lunar's Essence x 10) yards.
        If she succeeds, the spirit cannot move further from
        the Exalt than its Essence Trait in yards and must
        materialize. If it does not have the Essence to materialize,
        then the additional Essence required is drained
        from the Lunar's reserves. If both the spirit and the
        Lunar cannot pay for the spirit's materialization, then
        the Essence is wasted, and the spirit remains immaterial.
        If the spirit is already further away than its Essence
        in yards, it may only move toward the Lunar. The
        Charm does not protect the Lunar from the spirit's
        actions, though each success beyond that needed to
        ensnare the spirit imposes a -1 die penalty to all of the
        spirit's actions. The spirit is held for a number of
        minutes equal to the Lunar's Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        If an encounter with a spirit goes wrong or if the
        being is intrinsically hostile, then the Lunar may have
        to fight it, a difficult proposition against a possibly
        incorporeal foe. The Spirit-Maiming Essence Attack
        is one of the Lunar's most potent weapons in such a
        conflict, allowing him to use his strength of will to
        bolster his material attacks. The Lunar must activate
        this Charm before he attacks. If the attack is successful,
        the damage caused by the attack is aggravated. In
        addition, the Lunar's player also reflexively rolls a
        number of dice equal to the Lunar's Manipulation +
        Essence and adds a bonus to the base damage of the
        attack equal to the number of successes rolled. Spirits
        destroyed with this Charm are gone forever, and they
        can sense Exalts who know it and threat them with the
        same wary respect reserved for those who can slay gods.
        Attacks enhanced with this Charm may explicitly be
        part of Combos with Charms of other Attributes.

        Terrestrial sorcery is the simplest magic wielded by
        Lunars, and the No Moons will initiate members of any
        caste as sorcerers provided an Exalt shows the appropriate
        intelligence and aptitude. Note that invoking this
        Charm only enables the character to cast a single
        Terrestrial Circle Sorcery spell. The actual spell itself
        has an Essence cost, often very high, that the character
        must pay to actualize the spell. This cost is listed in the
        spell's description. Terrestrial Circle Sorcery can never
        be part of a Combo.

        Knowledge of this Charm allows a Lunar to tattoo a newly
        Exalted Lunar, fixing his caste and allowing him to resist the
        physical (but not mental) warping properties of the Wyld. The
        Lunar can fix the newly tattooed Exalt's caste as whichever he
        chooses, but the tests of initiation are used to determined the
        Lunar's caste. The experience points spent are gone forever.
        This Charm is generally practiced only by Lunars of the No
        Moon Caste, but other Lunars know it. However, it is considered
        inappropriate for Lunars of castes other than No Moon to
        tattoo young Lunars. The use of this Charm requires a ceremony
        of several hours, where occult instruments are used to
        draw the moonsilver tattoos into the Lunar's skin.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can engrave or otherwise mark
        an item so that it is immune to the chaotic effects of the Wyld,
        an untamed Demesne or another source of shapechanging.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Though others may attempt to forge moonsilver,
        only a Lunar Exalted has the knowledge and spiritual
        connection to the Magical Material to shape it effectively.
        Enacting this Charm forges a bond between the
        Lunar and the moonsilver being worked. Moonsilver is
        essentially impossible to work without the use of this
        Charm, and the technique is a jealously guarded secret of
        the Lunars. This bond must be maintained â€” and the
        Essence committed â€” for the duration of the item-crafting
        effort, even when the object is not in the Lunar's
        immediate presence. Failing to maintain the Charm
        results in the immediate failure of the creation effort,
        though the moonsilver can be reused in a later project.
        The Essence cost of the Charm is twice the rating of the
        artifact the Lunar seeks to create. This is in addition to
        the basic Essence cost for creating the item (see Chapter
        Five of The Book of Three Circles for the specifics and
        rules of item creation).

        &lt;br&gt;
        Celestial sorcery is much harder to learn and master
        than Terrestrial magics, and its practice among the
        Lunar Exalted is restricted to members of the No Moon
        Caste, who must undergo a rigorous (and often deadly)
        training regime before they are entrusted with its secrets.
        Note that invoking this Charm only enables the character
        to cast a single Celestial Circle Sorcery spell. The
        actual spell itself has an Essence cost, often very high,
        that the character must pay to actualize the spell. This
        cost is listed in the spell's description. Celestial Circle
        Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.
