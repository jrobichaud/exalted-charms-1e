        The bodies of the Exalted are more durable than
        those of mere mortals. To help simulate this, an Exalt
        may buy extra health levels as if they were a Charm. A
        player may purchase this Charm up to once per dot of the
        Endurance Ability her character possesses. Each provides
        one -0 health level.

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The stars bathe the character in yellow stardust. It
        suffuses her, glittering beneath her skin, hair, clothing
        and eyes. She begins to run. She must keep her eyes
        focused straight forward, keep her course within 10
        degrees of its original heading and can take no other
        actions save walk, sprint, run, jump, ride, use a mobility-enhancing
        Charm or invoke the Lesser Sign of Mercury.
        Violating these strictures ends the Charm's effects. In
        exchange, for the duration of the Charm, the character
        receives an additional 5L/5B soak, needs no sleep, suffers
        no fatigue and adds her Essence to all Endurance rolls.
        Fatigue rolls do not need to be made for her wearing
        armor, regardless of environmental conditions. These
        benefits also apply to any horse she rides.&lt;br&gt;
        The character's journey is a thing of fate and not
        chance, interwoven with her reasons for traveling. If
        something renders her journey irrelevant or alters its
        appropriate destination, her player automatically makes
        a reflexive Perception + Awareness check for the Sidereal.
        Even on failure, she senses a change in the situation.
        Success gives her a hint of what it might be. Exalted who
        invoke this Charm while fleeing pursuit often know
        when it is safe to stop their flight.

        The character's world narrows to his journey. The
        strands of fate that bind him to things behind him
        loosen. This Charm includes all of the benefits of the
        Unswerving Juggernaut Principle. In addition, it grants
        an increased (10L/10B) soak bonus against attacks the
        character cannot see coming. He can dodge any attack
        reflexively with a dice pool of 0 and his permanent
        Essence in automatic successes. He can evade pursuit
        and cover his tracks without slowing down, deviating
        from his course or ending the Charm. This requires the
        normal Wits + Survival roll. This Charm does not defeat
        supernatural tracking such as Inevitable Pursuit. It ex-
        plicitly prevents trackers from noticing the straight-line
        travel the Forward-Thinking Technique enforces unless
        they succeed at the tracking contest.

        Type: Simple
        Minimum Endurance: 2
        Minimum Essence: 1
        Prerequisite Charms: None
        Reflecting on the great sacrifices she might someday
        make for others, the character passes her hand over the
        weave of fate and imbues events with her own generosity
        of spirit. Weapons and other damage sources turn aside
        from her skin. She adds her permanent Essence to her
        lethal and bashing soak. This soak specifically applies
        even to aggravated damage sources. Creatures with Essence
        lower than her Compassion must spend one
        Willpower point each time they attempt to damage or
        disable her, or the attack automatically fails. This Charm
        is incompatible with the use of armor.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character's calm certainty in his own destiny
        turns aside a single event that might otherwise do him
        harm. Players of attackers with an Essence lower than the
        Sidereal's Temperance must succeed at a Willpower roll,
        or the attackers falter, and their attacks automatically
        fail. Even if they succeed, the character adds his permanent
        Essence to his lethal and bashing soak. This soak
        specifically applies even to aggravated damage sources.

        The character's chest convulses as she swallows her
        heart. This suspends the normal functioning of her body.
        The Exalt no longer suffers nor accumulates penalties
        from disease, poison, degenerative effects, hunger, thirst,
        fatigue, exhaustion, cold, heat, wounds or blood loss. She
        does not need to breathe. She emerges from this Charm
        in the exact physical state she entered it, save for any new
        wounds taken and any poisons or diseases she contracted
        while under the effect - which, effectively, enter her
        system at that point. While this Charm lasts, the Exalt
        ignores all accrued penalties from debilitating conditions
        and wounds and is unaware of their existence. Sufficient
        injury yields a nagging tactical distress that encourages
        her to withdraw from combat, but she otherwise cannot
        accept the notion that she is sick, poisoned, hungry, cold,
        wounded or otherwise impaired. She does not regain
        Essence except through the use of Charms. She functions
        normally when Incapacitated and cannot be knocked
        unconscious, but she can be killed by doing more than her
        Stamina health levels beyond Incapacitated.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the scripture
        of the Eternal Maiden. The character releases it into
        the air, where it darts and dances randomly about, staying
        within 100 yards of him, trailing vivid afterimages of yellow
        light. The character names a goal, which can be as grandiose
        or minor as he chooses, and geases himself to fulfill it.&lt;br&gt;
        A character under the influence of this Charm
        forsakes his name and his identity. Rolls to remember the
        character suffer a -3 die penalty (in addition to the
        normal penalty for remembering a Sidereal). The Exalt
        cannot focus on any goal save the one he named in the
        Charm. Irrelevant actions are forbidden. He suffers a
        three die penalty on all rolls that — while helping him
        toward his goal - have another primary purpose. How-
        ever, any non-aggravated injury or impairment the
        character receives while the Charm is active heals at the
        rate of one lethal health level or all bashing health levels
        per turn. Aggravated damage taken under the Charm's
        effects heals at one level per hour. The character heals
        preexisting conditions at the normal rate.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can end the Charm at any time but
        cannot reclaim his name and identity until he achieves his
        goal. If his goal becomes impossible to achieve, these things
        are forever lost. He cannot personally establish a new
        identity or name, and all attempts to do so fail, but high-
        ranking members of his division can issue replacements.

        Ordained Bridle of Mercury&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 experience point&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Until the character applies Mercury's bridle&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character petitions Mercury to weave a mount
        into her destiny. Each time she invokes this Charm, she
        gains a dot of the Familiar Background, normally with a
        creature she can ride. She can use this Charm to instantly
        increase her bond with an existing familiar.
        Alternately, she can invoke Mercury's guidance in finding
        a new, &amp;quot;suitable&amp;quot; familiar. Her player specifies the
        species. The character must travel to find the familiar
        but always knows the way. The destined familiar always
        allows the character to approach and set a bridle of
        stardust upon its head. The bridle fades, but the Background
        dot remains. If the character cannot afford to
        establish a complete bond, Mercury can lead her to that
        animal again with another invocation of the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        It costs an extra experience point to summon forth
        the bridle of Mercury and apply it to an animal of the
        character's choosing rather than the Maiden's. Similarly,
        the first dot of the Familiar Background costs an extra
        experience point for animals unsuitable for riding - such
        as a hawk. Note that controlling a familiar mount requires
        a Ride roll in only the most extreme circumstances.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted can purchase a total number of
        familiars and acquaintances no greater than their permanent
        Essence, unmodified by Charms such as the
        Soul Fire Shaper Form (see p. 193).

        Drawing on her understanding of the spirit world,
        the character forces a metamorphosis upon one of her
        familiars. The creature adopts some of the characteristics
        of a spirit, as follows:&lt;br&gt;
        • Its Essence, Valor, and Intelligence increase to
        a minimum of 2.&lt;br&gt;
        • It acquires an Essence pool of (Essence x 10) +
        (Willpower x 3) + (Sum of Virtues x 2) — typically 51.&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar's health levels become equal to its
        Willpower + Conviction — typically 8.&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar's natural state is dematerialized. For
        a mote of Essence, it can manifest visually.&lt;br&gt;
        • It learns the Materialize Charm, which costs half
        its motes to use. It learns one additional spirit Charm
        of the Storyteller's choice if the Familiar Background is
        3 or more and another if it is 5,&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar develops an alternate shape, roughly
        human but still deeply reminiscent in appearance of
        the familiar's true nature.&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar ceases to depend upon ordinary
        nourishment.&lt;br&gt;
        • Yu-Shan registers the familiar as a small god. Its
        primary duty is service to the character. However, it
        may be called or reassigned to other duty.
        The numbers above assume that a typical beast
        familiar has Essence 2, Willpower 5, Compassion 2,
        Conviction 3, Temperance 1 and Valor 2 after the use
        of this Charm. Most non-familiar beasts have lower
        Essence, Willpower and Compassion.

        The character arranges a promotion for his
        familiar. Its Essence and Intelligence increase to
        a minimum of 3. It develops additional Virtues,
        if necessary, to bring the sum of its Virtues to 12
        or more. It learns two additional spirit Charms of
        the Storyteller's choice and one additional shape.
        It also acquires certain specific responsibilities:&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar is responsible for safely escorting the
        character to Yu-Shan and back when necessary and for
        the character's behavior while in Yu-Shan. As an Essence
        3 spirit, it possesses the innate ability to carry itself
        and others between Yu-Shan and Creation.&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar is responsible for delivering any
        messages Heaven has for the character and must be
        regularly available in Yu-Shan to collect them.&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar must file regular reports on the
        character's activities. Although these reports pass
        through the Bureau of Destiny mailroom and are vulner-
        able to interception, they are rarely read - all are
        ultimately forwarded to the august weaver Caturasya,
        who eats them.&lt;br&gt;
        • The familiar may receive additional miscellaneous
        duties in Yu-Shan.&lt;br&gt;

        The character petitions Mercury to weave a mortal
        companion into her destiny. Each time she invokes
        this Charm, she gains a dot of the Acquaintances
        Background, bonding first with a single mortal and
        then with those around him. She can use this Charm
        to instantly increase her connection with a specific
        acquaintance and his social context. Alternately, she
        can invoke Mercury's guidance in finding a new,
        &amp;quot;suitable&amp;quot; acquaintance. Her player specifies the general
        occupation and personality. The character must
        travel to find the acquaintance but always knows the
        way. The destined acquaintance always allows the
        character to approach and set a bit made of stardust in
        his mouth. Once it sinks in, the mortal loses the
        memory of that embarrassing moment, but the Background
        dot remains.&lt;br&gt;
        It costs an extra experience point to summon forth
        the bit of stardust and apply it to a person of the
        character's choosing rather than the Maiden's. Similarly,
        the first dot of the Acquaintances Background
        costs an extra experience point for people unsuitable for
        riding — such as humans. (Some Wyld barbarians might
        make acceptable mounts.)&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted can purchase a total number of
        familiars and acquaintances no greater than their permanent
        Essence, unmodified by Charms such as the Soul
        Fire Shaper Form (see p. 193).

        The character sees the glimmering yellow light of
        Mercury illumine the shortest path to his destination.
        This path is not necessarily safe, but the character can
        expect to overcome any obstacles thereupon. This Charm
        takes delays from such things as off-road travel, the need
        for food and rest and injuries from dangerous encounters
        into account. Roll the character's Essence. One success
        indicates a substantial improvement in his speed over
        ordinary travel. If the character has a deadline and any
        chance exists of making it on time, three successes
        indicate his timely arrival. Five or more successes allow
        him to make any appointment not already missed.

        A nimbus of Mercury's light wraps around the
        character's mount, and it develops the ability to overcome
        any obstacle to complete its journey. The player makes a
        Charisma + Ride roll. Each success adds five yards to the
        mount's base speed. In addition, the mount is undaunted by
        natural obstacles of any sort: for as many turns as necessary,
        it can gallop in the air across chasms, straight up a cliff face,
        across water or a swamp and weave through crowds of
        panicked yeddim. Only barriers built by people - such as
        walls of stone or sorcery - pose any obstacle. Sidereal
        Exalted may always use their Temperance with this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses a prayer strip inscribed with the
        scripture of the Desirable Maiden. The character affixes it to
        the forehead of a familiar or an acquaintance, either long-established
        or acquired through Charms. An indescribable
        sense of shock, horror and elation immediately fills the
        victim, who struggles for the next five turns to rip the strip
        free. Unless the victim is restrained, this requires no roll.&lt;br&gt;
        At the end of those five turns, the familiar or
        acquaintance undergoes a transformation, burning with
        a terrible golden celestial light. Its form twists and
        reshapes into a lesser elemental dragon. This Charm
        exerts a great toll on the victim's body and soul, and
        when the Charm runs its course, nothing but a burned-out
        husk remains — a person or animal able to accept
        food and mumble incoherently, but nothing more. That
        Familiar or Acquaintances Background is permanently
        lost, but at that moment, the character can choose either
        an air or a water dragon as her mount for a scene.&lt;br&gt;
        The transformed dragon, its back writhing with the
        symbols of the scripture, has no will of its own. The
        Sidereal must ride it and direct its actions with her own.
        The dragon flies at 500 mph, with effectively unlimited
        tactical movement. It has a Dodge pool of 10 and a soak of
        20 against all attacks. It attacks with 15 Speed, Accuracy
        and Defense for 19 lethal damage. For each successful
        Charisma + Ride roll the Sidereal's player makes in a given
        turn, the mount takes one action at its full dice pool. Note
        that the Sidereal must split her pool to make multiple Ride
        rolls. The dragon has 10 health levels, all at -O. It can use
        any spirit Charm or elemental power, with the exception
        of extra action Charms or those that grant permanent
        bonuses or penalties. The Sidereal pays for these Charms or
        powers with her own motes, Willpower and health levels.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        Clapping her hands, the character surrounds an elemental
        or spirit of water or the sea in a fiery yellow aura.
        Mercury calls that creature to journey. Its reasons to visit
        another place, where important unfinished business awaits
        it, press increasingly upon its mind. Simply by using the
        Charm, the Exalt proves and guarantees that such business
        already exists in some distant place. If necessary, the creature
        becomes aware of it. The creature must make a Willpower
        roll not to set forth immediately. For the duration of the
        scene, Mercury's call reduces the target number for any
        character's attempts to drive the creature away, physically or
        socially. This benefit applies to both attack and damage rolls.

        The character exhales a puff of wind that travels
        beyond the world and disentangles the destiny of ship,
        sky and sea. No matter how fierce the weather or the
        waves, the ship sails smoothly, isolated from the world.
        For the duration of the scene, Sail checks made for the
        character ignore environmental penalties. He sails on
        a placid sea, with a good wind behind him and the favor
        of the local spirits, even if a typhoon rages around his
        location. He still suffers penalties for any damage the
        ship has taken, but it takes on no further water, and its
        condition does not degenerate naturally for the remainder
        of the scene.

        The character casts salt into a puddle or body of
        water beneath her. Its surface breaks and dissolves into
        foaming whitecaps, and the character vanishes. From
        her perspective, the whitecaps rush out in all directions,
        and then, she stands atop a field of white that is — at any
        given moment — water, wind-blown flower petals or
        butterflies. The world around her fades away as she
        separates herself from the normal processes of fate.&lt;br&gt;
        While this Charm remains active, the character can
        travel at twice her normal pace, ignoring any obstacles.
        She remains in Creation, but her presence and location
        are obscured. Only the slightest shimmer in the wind
        marks her passing, which increases the difficulty of
        Awareness checks to notice her or Survival checks to
        track her by 2. She cannot sense the world around her at
        all. Nevertheless, when the Charm ends, she invariably
        finds herself in an auspicious location. If at all possible
        given the distance and general direction of her journey,
        she does not find herself in immediate danger, under
        observation or in a precarious location when she arrives.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can use this Charm when on board a
        ship (or any construct suspended entirely above a body
        of water) by casting salt into the water below. The entire
        ship and crew then travels with her. It sails at twice its
        normal speed across the field of white. An auspicious
        location for a ship's arrival includes the existence of
        water sufficient to keep it afloat.&lt;br&gt;
        As an alternative to mortal travel, a character using
        this Charm can travel to Yu-Shan. This requires five
        days on foot or a day on shipboard. Travel to other
        unusual locations, such as Malfeas, may be possible at the
        Storyteller's discretion. This always requires five days.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden at Sea. The character casts it at
        an adversarial force, and it hangs in the air, wreathed in
        dandelion-hued lightning, until the resolution of the
        Charm destroys it.&lt;br&gt;
        The character may use this Charm when faced with
        any meaningful hazard at sea: storms, thirst while be-
        calmed, pirates, monsters, reefs, mutiny and so forth.
        The character must then take action to remove the
        hazard as a practical threat to her life, health and progress.
        If she ensures that it cannot reasonably prevent a safe
        conclusion to her journey, the Charm marks her victory
        by wreaking massive damage upon the force that op-
        posed her. It tears storms from the sky, breaks the calm
        in a fierce wind, splits the pirate ship in two, consumes
        the monster's corpse with fire and so forth. It kills extras
        and shatters inanimate things. Defeated characters suf-
        fer sufficient bashing damage to reduce them instantly to
        Incapacitated, although fate restores their consciousness
        (healing them to -4) if they face an immediate threat to
        life and limb before waking. In general, the prayer strip
        accomplishes this devastation in the moment of its own
        destruction, casting forth fire, thunder and lightning.&lt;br&gt;
        Each travail speeds the character toward her destiny,
        granting an ever-greater attunement to the Essence
        flows of fate and the world. Each time the character
        invokes this Charm and permits it to run its full duration,
        increase her effective permanent Essence by 1, to a
        maximum of 8. Also, increase the effective permanent
        Essence of characters working closely with her by 1, to a
        maximum of 6. These bonuses last until the end of the
        story, but cannot be used as a basis for training or for
        gaining Charms.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm requires that the voyage have a purpose
        — the character cannot simply sail around in circles and
        must have some reason to travel across the sea. However,
        the character can freely favor sailing over other means of
        travel when it forms a reasonable alternative. Characters
        cannot learn otherwise unavailable Charms while under
        the effect of the Five Ordeals Odyssey.

        As she mirrors herself to the land, the character
        bends the wild directly to her will. Under the pressure of
        her intention, trees shift their places and river dragons
        cease to hunger. She can make cosmetic changes to the
        scenery in uncivilized regions and dictate the behavior of
        any wild beast she can see. She receives all the benefits
        of Adopting the Untamed Face. Unless they know
        better, Lunar Exalted perceive her as an eminent mem-
        ber of their own kind — that is, ikth-ya, as described on
        page 112 of Exalted: the Lunars. Sidereal characters
        with Essence 5 or more appear as murr-ya.&lt;br&gt;
        Lunars do not imagine a Tell or Caste Mark or other
        such indicators. The Sidereal Exalted simply carries
        herself like an ikth-ya and, therefore, must be a Lunar.&lt;br&gt;
        Even if a Lunar knows better, the impression is difficult

        The character extends her influence into the sky,
        adjusting the region's weather. Her player rolls Stamina +
        Survival. The number of successes determines how harsh
        the Exalt makes the weather. Specifically, other characters'
        players need at least that many successes on a Survival
        roll for their characters to survive the new conditions
        without hardship. The Sidereal can voluntarily reduce
        this difficulty when creating the storm. If the Exalt wishes
        to calm the weather, she needs only one success.
        Generally, this Charm takes effect within either
        minutes or hours, depending on the magnitude
        of the effects.

        The character strives to mirror the fate of an air
        spirit or elemental to the flows of her own Essence, and
        vice versa. Her player rolls Manipulation + Survival
        against a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence. If she
        succeeds, the Exalt imposes one of her goals upon the
        spirit. It appreciates the importance of that goal to the
        same degree and in the same fashion the Sidereal does.
        It can choose between that goal and its other beliefs
        when and if they clash dramatically. Using this Charm in
        a civilized region or against a civilized spirit adds +2 to
        the difficulty. It can be adapted for use against spirits and
        elementals of other elements, but this also adds +2
        difficulty. Sidereal Exalted may always use their Compassion

        This Charm co-opts a wild region and turns it
        against the Exalt's enemies. So long as the character
        remains within sight of the prayer strip, he notices
        anyone of interest within his Essence in miles, even
        those who are not able to be tracked by non-supernatural
        trackers. He can give anyone three automatic successes
        on all Survival rolls made within the region or reduce
        anyone's Survival pool to 0 before they benefit from
        Charms. Each effect requires a further commitment of 2
        motes per person so affected.
        The Sidereal can also convey the location of someone
        or something to a local beast or spirit. The Charm's
        target sees the indicated person or thing as a hated
        enemy. This requires 5 motes and a successful Manipulation
        + Survival roll against the beast or spirit's Essence.
        The 5 motes are not committed. Intelligent victims can
        change their minds if given reason to rethink the
        situation. Sidereal Exalted may always use their Valor
        with this Charm.

        The Sidereal's eyes reflect a yellow light as she looks
        away from the present and toward the pattern of impending
        fate. She casts the shadow of her weapon from her
        hand, and it speeds toward her target. The player makes
        an attack roll normally, ignoring penalties for range and
        weather. The Sidereal must be able to see the target, and
        the attack must be within the weapon's maximum range
        (normally triple the listed range).&lt;br&gt;
        Even if the character misses, the shadow inexorably
        approaches the target's heart. The next turn, the Sidereal
        can attempt the attack again with a new Thrown roll. This
        is a normal action but uses the shadow weapon already in
        the air. It can be enhanced with appropriate Charms. This
        attack ignores range limitations on the weapon.&lt;br&gt;
        If the shadow hits, the target loses two points of
        temporary Willpower as a spirit-bird screams in the
        mansion of the Gull and the house of Endings quietly
        takes note. In addition, the character's weapon appears,
        quivering, in the target's chest, doing normal damage. If
        the character does not spend a Thrown action every turn
        on this Charm, the shadow fades away.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Temperance
        with this Charm.

        The character makes the Inferior Sign of the Gull
        over his weapon, whispers to it to seek the heart (or some
        other desired organ) and throws. This attack adds his
        Essence to the raw damage of the attack. In addition, if
        the weapon hits, it emits a soft yellow radiance that calls
        to things traveling through the air. Once per turn, when
        someone in range misses with a Thrown or Archery
        attack, the Exalt can reflexively spend 2 motes to summon
        the projectile to the wound. The player of the
        person responsible for the attack must immediately reflexively
        reroll the attack against the target of this
        Charm. All Charms used on the original attack still
        apply except for those inapplicable to the new target and
        those that allow the attack to target multiple characters.
        The Charms need not be paid for again. Removing the
        weapon requires a simple Strength + Athletics action
        and ends the effects of this Charm. If left alone long
        enough, the embedded weapon eventually attracts stray
        insects, birds and flying debris.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The blade of a knife is the gate between life and
        death. The target's fate is to suffer its touch. The character
        dispenses with the intermediate steps, hurling a blade
        of Essence up to (his Essence x 20) yards. It moves at such
        speed that it cannot be blocked, only dodged, the wind
        of its passage dragging the character up to 20 yards in the
        direction of its travel. It suffers no penalties from range,
        has an accuracy equal to the character's Essence and does
        (Strength + 6L) damage. The character chooses how far
        the blade pulls him toward the target.&lt;br&gt;
        Creatures of the shadowlands have passed beyond
        death's gate, and the Essence Thorn drags them closer to
        life. Hit by the blade, they suffer no damage. Instead,
        convert damage successes one for one into points of temporary
        Willpower lost. Such being can be reduced to a
        minimum of 0 temporary Willpower. If brought to 0 Willpower
        by this attack, the creature suffers hallucinations
        and disorientation, taking no actions save to engage in
        reverie, self-defense or extended self-defense (i.e., escape)
        for the remainder of the scene. Abyssal Exalted are alive
        and take damage. Deathlords are immune to the Essence
        Thorn unless already at 0 Willpower when it strikes them.

        Before making a Thrown attack, the character
        touches her weapon to the skin beneath her eye. She
        bleeds three drops of blood onto the weapon, symbolizing
        the sorrow she might theoretically feel for her impending
        victim. It is the way of fate that pain begets pain. Apply
        the victim's current wound penalty to the target number
        for both the attack and damage rolls. For example, against
        a character with a -2 wound penalty, the target number
        for both rolls would be 5. Sidereal Exalted may always use
        their Compassion with this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and Shadow. The character casts
        it at an opponent or object as a Thrown weapon with a
        range of 100 yards and Accuracy +0. If it hits, it adheres,
        wreathing the target in an unpleasant, pulsing yellow
        glow. The Exalt can only have one such strip active at
        any given time, and it can only affix to someone with
        hostile intentions toward him.&lt;br&gt;
        While this Charm is in effect, whenever the character
        takes damage and has at least one mobile hand, a hatchet
        of Essence leaps from his hand to attack the target. It passes
        freely through obstacles and across any distance up to a
        quarter mile, screaming like a bird. There is no roll, and
        the strike can be averted only by perfect dodges and perfect
        parries that are specifically able to block any attack
        Ignoring non-perfect soaks, it inflicts the character's Essence
        in dice of unsoakable lethal damage. For each health
        level the target loses, the Sidereal heals one health level
        - the harsh fate inflicted upon him has been given to
        another. This is a reflexive action and does not count
        against the character's actions for that turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Sometimes, it is harder to stop a terrible journey
        than to embark upon it. The victim of this Charm suffers
        an overpowering, irrational desire to hurt the character.
        Despite the unpleasant consequences of each attack, she
        has difficulty remembering how to stop. Each turn, to
        avoid attacking the Sidereal with the greatest force
        available to her, her player must succeed at a Willpower
        roll. If the victim cannot see or hear the character, the
        effect subsides. She can spend a temporary Willpower to
        free herself from the compulsion until she sees or hears
        the character again.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        Elegant Patterns of Fate&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 2 motes per die&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Sidereals can normally use an Intelligence + Craft
        (Fate) roll to design aesthetic weaves of events and
        circumstance that appeal to the various planning committees
        as means for untangling the snarls in the Loom
        of Fate. However, shaping these weaves so that they still
        further the character's personal goals, by the time everyone
        involved sets their stamp on the project, requires a
        supernatural insight into the bureaucracy of Heaven.
        This Charm provides that insight.&lt;br&gt;
        Elegant Patterns of Fate adds up to the character's
        Essence in dice to the Craft roll and allows the result to
        steer the course of events. This uses the normal rules for
        using Craft to plan projects. The character literally
        designs a blueprint for the future. The difficulty depends
        on the scale and precision of the design. The number of
        successes provides a rough measure of its quality and
        robustness. Each success represents one horrible fluke,
        one heroic effort to escape the web of fate or one clash
        with the efforts of the Yozis or Malfeans that the
        character's plan endures.&lt;br&gt;
        Many such designs go into any given day's fate. A
        number of Sidereal Exalted have this Charm. Spirits
        with the Creation of Perfection Charm (see Games of
        Divinity, p. 127) can also compete at the destiny-
        designing game. Treat the relevant rolls as explicitly
        opposed but only to see what happens when two plans
        conflict. For example, if one plan focuses on the death of
        Cathak Cainan of House Cathak and the transfer of his
        power to his son, while another relies on Cainan's
        support for a joint venture with House V'neef, the
        opposed roll decides whether he lives or dies. However,
        even if he lives, his power likely drifts into his son's
        hands. Even if he dies, House Cathak probably supports
        the joint venture.&lt;br&gt;
        Members of the Eclipse and Moonshadow Castes can
        learn this Charm, but it does them no good unless some-
        one submits their proposals to the Bureau of Destiny.

        Having planned some work of mundane or magical
        craftsmanship, the character weaves that plan into the
        more general design for the world. This ensures a swift
        and precise implementation. The Charm can reduce the
        target number of the final Dexterity + Craft or Intelligence
        + Craft roll. Also, the Sidereal divides the required
        construction time by her Essence.

        Characters with this Charm develop skill in manipulating
        fate in a specific, personal fashion. Each
        purchase of this Charm creates a circumstance — with
        the same breadth as a specialty - during which she
        automatically reduces the target number of all her ac-
        tions by 1. The character can purchase this Charm up to
        three times, applying it to the same circumstance or to a
        new one each time. There is no cost to use this Charm's
        effects - learning this Charm simply enhances the
        Exalt's capabilities.&lt;br&gt;
        A Sidereal's appearance often shifts subtly as she
        develops this Charm. For example, a character with a
        specialty at fate alteration &amp;quot;In Cities&amp;quot; becomes more
        urbane. A character who specializes in using fate &amp;quot; Against
        Demons&amp;quot; develops a martial appearance. A gleam in her
        Maiden's color may skate down the starmetal of her
        sword when a demon's presence is revealed.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character can intertwine the fate of objects
        with her own, binding to her a total number of objects no
        greater than her Craft (Fate) score. To bind an object,
        she must handle it for an hour. This has no cost. After-
        ward, at any time, she can spend 2 motes of Essence to
        learn a general description of the object's circumstances
        - information on the order of &amp;quot;in a guarded vault in a
        rich man's house in the Scavenger Lands&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;traveling
        through the Wyld in the hands of a Lunar Exalt.&amp;quot; Given
        basic knowledge of its situation, she can instead spend 2
        Essence to call it back into her hands, describing a
        reasonable method by which fate could bring it closer to
        her. For example, &amp;quot;one of the guards decides he must
        have it for his own, steals it and flees the city to avoid
        retribution.&amp;quot; This might not work, but something hap-
        pens. If the guards are incorruptible, one experiences a
        strong temptation. An incompetent guard might steal it
        but get caught. If the character tries often enough,
        though, she eventually succeeds. She can freely release
        the binding on an object that no longer interests her.&lt;br&gt;
        In combat, the character can use this Charm and a
        stunt to recall a lost weapon or object into her hands. For
        example, a stumbling enemy might kick her daiklave back
        into her grasp, or a bracer fallen over a cliff might rise back
        up on a hybroc's head even as the character dives for it.

        The character can patch damage to the local pattern
        of fate. The Sidereal's player rolls Dexterity + Craft
        (Fate). Each success heals one health level that the
        target lost to a creature or effect of Malfeas, the Underworld
        or the Wyld. Alternately, success can heal minor
        debilitating effects caused by such creatures, requiring
        one success for each mote of Essence spent on that harm.
        Thus, three successes can break a demon's Possession
        Charm, while 60 successes can heal a region wounded by
        a Deathlord's Rain of Doom.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm has a limited ability to counter the
        direct effects of the Wyld. Five successes can cleanse a
        Wyld pox (see Exalted, p. 280). Twenty successes can
        remove a stronger Wyld mutation or Taint. Fifty successes
        can cleanse a small region within Creation of
        Wyld influence.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not permit extended rolls, but
        multiple Sidereal Exalted can apply it in the same turn,
        adding their successes. Sidereal Exalted may always use
        their Valor with this Charm.

        materials, the character twists the prayer strip and binds
        it around his wrists. It transforms into a band of cold blue
        light, slowly twisting and slithering around the bound
        extremities. The Sidereal suffers a +2 difficulty penalty
        to actions using his hands for the duration of this Charm.
        This Charm extends the Excellent Implementation
        of Objectives Charm. Instead of encouraging the swift
        implementation of the Exalt's design through fate, destiny
        literally constructs the object for him as it ticks,
        second by second, into the world. Ignoring the normal
        mechanisms by which things happen, the components of
        the design assemble and mold themselves, needing no
        direct intervention. The process takes a scene for mun-
        dane construction, a day for works involving the Magical
        Materials and a month for massive projects such as
        Manses and artifact ships. This Charm does not allow
        the Exalt to work with moonsilver.&lt;br&gt;
        The character automatically receives a perfect suc-
        cess on his Craft pool for building the item: All dice come
        up successes. In addition, all extra successes from the
        planning phase carry over as additional successes on the
        Craft roll. However, this form of Craft is not an extended
        action. The character cannot achieve any further successes
        through additional uses of this Charm or by making
        Craft rolls. Also, the Charm only shapes what is present.
        The character must procure the materials to be fabricated.&lt;br&gt;
        The character must have both the relevant Craft
        and Craft (Fate) at 4 or higher to use this Charm.
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Compassion with
        this Charm.

        Predicting the path of a blade or blow well in
        advance, the Exalted arranges to be somewhere else
        when it lands. He can reduce the target number of a

        The character sees impending danger rippling toward
        her in the skein of fate and, as with Absence,
        chooses not to meet it. Her player rolls Dexterity +
        Dodge against a difficulty equal to her opponent's Essence.
        If the roll succeeds, the Exalt avoids any undesirable
        effect, including attacks she is not aware of, attacks with
        an area of effect, attacks with no physical component
        such as the Irresistible Questioning Technique and continuous
        deleterious effects such as You and Yours Stance.
        She must Duck Fate before her opponent's player makes
        the attack roll or as soon as her player knows about the
        effect, whichever is applicable. She need evade a continuous
        effect only once.

        Sometimes, the best answer to trouble is not being
        there at all. In the first two turns of combat or the first
        minute of a social encounter, the Sidereal's player can
        declare, &amp;quot;I'm not there.&amp;quot; It turns out — at least as far as
        anyone can prove — that the Exalt anticipated the
        situation prophetically and was somewhere else, of the
        Storyteller's choosing, all along.&lt;br&gt;
        For this Charm's purposes, the first minute of a social
        encounter begins at the last chance the Exalt had to
        conveniently leave. If the character is chatting with a
        friend and Lilith shows up, a new social encounter has
        begun. The Sidereal can use this Charm, retroactively
        making her excuses and ducking out sometime before-
        hand. If the character is chatting with Lilith and a friend
        shows up, however, she's still in the encounter with Lilith.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Generous Sidereals learn to spot impending danger
        to others as well. When activating this Charm, the
        character chooses a number of targets whose total Essence
        does not exceed her own. While the Trouble
        Reduction Strategy is in force, the character can use any
        other Dodge Charm she knows to benefit a consenting
        target instead of herself. Simple and extra action Charms
        use the character's action and Dodge pool. Reflexive
        Charms use the character's Dodge pool. Supplemental
        Charms enhance the target's dice action.&lt;br&gt;
        Using a Charm on someone else's behalf counts as
        using that Charm that turn. The Exalt must pay for the
        Charm. She can only use other Charms that turn if she
        declares an appropriate Combo when using her first
        Charm. If the Combo includes non-reflexive Charms
        from other Abilities, the character cannot use it with the
        Trouble Reduction Strategy. If it includes reflexive
        Charms from other Abilities, she cannot use them on the
        target's behalf. She could, for example, Combo Absence
        and Shield of Mars (see p. 163). When she invoked the
        Combo, she could use Absence but not Shield of Mars to
        protect a friend. She must take a dodge action that turn,
        assisted by Absence, even if no one tries to hit her,
        because it is a supplemental Charm in a Combo. She can
        reflexively invoke the Shield of Mars.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Compassion
        with this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses a long prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Hunted Maiden. The character twists it
        and wraps it around her waist, whereupon it transforms
        into a band of crystalline Essence the color of the sky. Each
        hour the Exalted leaves this Charm in force, the band
        tightens, doing two levels of unsoakable bashing damage.
        This damage cannot be healed until the Charm ends.
        The character begins to walk or run. These are the
        only acceptable forms of motion, but she can enhance
        them with Charms or the Lesser Sign of Mercury. As the
        character travels, the weave of Creation shifts, dragging
        part of the world after her. Specifically, both the general
        terrain and all habitations within her Essence in miles
        move with her. In the planning rooms of fate, this Charm
        slowly changes the records of each transported thing's
        position. Thus, their fated interactions in the moments
        to come take place in a new location.
        This Charm alters divine records, which are then
        interpreted by those who feed fate into the world.
        Accordingly, it is an intelligent effect. The Sidereal
        cannot shear a mountain or city in two. If the Charm
        cannot logically divide such features, given the radius
        of effect, they do not travel at all. Further, Creation fills
        in the &amp;quot;vacant space&amp;quot; with something reasonable. Finally,
        the Sidereal cannot &amp;quot;erase&amp;quot; anything important
        by dragging land onto it. If she drags a desert onto a
        Manse in a forested region, the forest retreats but does
        not vanish. The Manse follows the forest or relocates to
        the desert. The new location seems correct and reasonable
        to all witnesses, although they remember the
        previous state of affairs.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm was first used to pull a key fortification
        out of the way of a Primordial assault, in the days when
        Exalted and Primordials warred. Using this Charm with-
        out authorization is a Severity 3 offense.

        Spoken properly, a person's name or nickname can
        pleasingly reflect the underlying pattern of his existence,
        forming a sense of completion in his heart. The character
        knows how to inflect a name in such a fashion. Her player
        rolls Charisma + Linguistics against the target's Essence.
        If the roll succeeds, the target experiences a momentary
        burst of warmth, happiness and connection to the Sidereal.
        If upset or violent, he loses his train of thought,
        forgetting what caused his unhappiness. He will not
        remember it naturally, but events may remind him. For
        example, seeing the Exalt standing over the murdered
        body of his bride with a bloody knife in her hand would
        immediately reinvoke his rage. This Charm fails before
        the Great Curse, and the character must know the
        target's name. Sidereal Exalted may always use their
        Compassion with this Charm.

        The Blue Vervain Binding is a minute-long formal
        blessing in the language of the Old Realm. It ties together
        two creatures' fates. (One creature can be the
        Sidereal himself.) Successfully reciting the binding requires
        perfect intonation, cadence and inflection
        throughout — and thus an Intelligence + Linguistics roll
        against difficulty 5. Forever after, to the limits of their
        intellects, each creature can understand the other perfectly
        and make herself understood.

        Reciting the Ice and Fire Binding is similarly complex
        and takes a full hour to complete. The player rolls Intelligence
        + Linguistics against a difficulty of 9. Each additional
        Sidereal who supports the Charm with her presence and
        words reduces the difficulty by 1, to a minimum of 5.
        Supporters need not know the Charm. This incantation
        summons a spirit or elemental of fire, with Essence less
        than the character's own and touches it with the essence
        of Serenity. For one season, it binds that spirit to seek the
        joy, health and pleasure of those around it. Afterward, it
        smoothly removes any details of the characters who summoned
        and bound it from the spirit's memory.

        This Charm uses a long prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Bride. The Sidereal and a consenting
        partner invoke it together. His partner need not know
        this Charm but must fully understand its implications.
        Together, they twist the strip and wind it around one
        finger each, reciting an oath in the language of the Old
        Realm. Both players roll Intelligence + Linguistics against
        difficulty 5. On a success, every detail of cant and
        expression is correct. The prayer strip shrivels and reshapes
        into two starmetal rings, set with sapphires.
        Neither character can ever directly or indirectly attempt
        to remove the rings. Others can destroy them using the
        standard rules for breaking a prayer strip.&lt;br&gt;
        While the rings endure, each character can reflexively
        spend the others' health levels, Essence and
        Willpower as his own. Treat motes of Essence drawn from
        the character's partner as Peripheral for the purpose of
        affecting the drawing characters' anima banner. A character
        automatically and involuntarily draws on the other's
        health levels when his partner has a smaller (pre-Charm)
        wound penalty than he. When defending or helping one's
        partner, treat all Compassion dice as automatic successes.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is tantamount to a wedding ceremony,
        and the Maidens expect their Exalted to treat it with
        reverence. The feelings between the characters need not
        be romantic love. They do not even have to be love at all
        — one can make a Lover's Oath of expedience. However,
        the bond remains sacred, and ill fate follows should
        one character treat his partner poorly.

        In many ways, Sidereals become the central figures
        in the lives of those around them — unrecognized,
        unknown, but nevertheless, the ones about whom events
        turn. When they call out for it, the world returns the
        love and service they have given it, offering its Essence
        to them freely. This Charm draws on the Exalt's ability
        to move through situations without taking overt action,
        encouraging spirits and the world to willingly take
        the actions she desires. It also draws on the sacrifices she
        makes, that the world should care for her so. Immediately
        after a successful roll using Compassion or
        immediately after a Performance roll that generated a
        significant surge of positive feeling toward the character,
        the Exalt regains twice her Compassion in motes of
        Essence, up to her normal maximum. There is no cost
        to use this Charm's effects - learning this Charm
        simply enhances the Exalt's capabilities.

        Misery fills the world, but it is an incomplete fate.
        Characters with this Charm would sketch a life of sorrow
        as a broken pattern, full of pain, casting forth strands of
        effort, desire, hope and fear that reach for fulfillment.
        Those strands blunt themselves on weakness and circumstance
        but implicitly define the rest of the pattern —
        the perfection that that person's life could be. The Exalt
        can manipulate events to temporarily complete such
        patterns. This is the dance of Venus. His words and
        actions, though apparently mundane, purify and brighten
        the lives around him. The cadence of his movements and
        his speech brings joy to the world. Though not a dance
        by normal definitions, his actions radiate an artistic
        elegance and precision.
        The player rolls Charisma + Performance. For one
        scene, the character and everyone he interacts with gains 1
        temporary Willpower point. This can increase Willpower
        past its normal maximum, but it cannot increase temporary
        Willpower past the number of successes rolled. Beneficiaries
        also feel fulfilled and happy. No character can gain Will-
        power from this Charm more than once per day. Sidereal
        Exalted may always use their Compassion with this Charm.

        this fashion, she bends the spirit to her ends.
        The Sidereal's player makes a Manipulation + Performance
        roll against the spirit's Essence. It must be able
        to hear the song, although it need not be awake or
        present. On a success, the spirit becomes one of the
        character's allies. Spending experience points equal to
        the spirit's Essence makes this permanent. Otherwise,
        the spirit forgets the Exalt at the end of the story.
        Spirits of fire and wood, embodying life and passion,
        are particularly vulnerable to this technique. Add a +2
        difficulty penalty when entrancing spirits of earth, water
        and air.

        The character closes the loose ends of fate, making a
        ceremony she participates in perfect and complete in the
        eyes of fate and the gods. Betrothals, funerals, banquets
        and other ceremonies all qualify. Her player rolls Charisma
        + Performance (as with a prayer roll, see Exalted,
        pp. 335-336) against a difficulty of (8 - the Resources cost
        of the ceremony). She adds her character's Essence in
        dice. She may lower the target number of this roll. Success
        provides a meaningful bias to fate, particularly in matters
        relevant to her caste. Thus, Chosen of Endings can easily
        arrange a smooth conclusion to a dead man's affairs, and
        the Chosen of Serenity can all but guarantee a couple's
        fertility. Active intervention from antagonists in Heaven
        or creatures outside of fate can muddle the result.

        Every time an audience's trust in the character is
        about to falter, the Exalt adapts her approach to form a
        better answer to its members' needs and desires. The
        player can add dice up to her character's Essence to
        Presence, Performance, Bureaucracy and Socialize rolls.
        This Charm is explicitly permitted to be used in a Combo
        with Charms of other Abilities.

        This Charm uses a long prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Dancer. The character binds it around
        her eyes, whereupon it transforms into a band of starmetal
        and blue jade. (It still abides by the normal rules for
        prayer strip destruction.) For the duration of this effect,
        the Exalt is genuinely blind and takes a +2 difficulty
        penalty on appropriate rolls.&lt;br&gt;
        The words of a character employing Harmonic
        Completion sound to others like the affirmations and
        truths they have waited their entire lives to hear. Each
        comes across as a measured antidote to every trouble
        written in their history and fate. The Exalt receives a
        perfect success on all Performance rolls to influence
        mortals. Anyone, mortal or Exalted, who does not deliberately
        tune her out falls in love. Any non-extra character
        can reflexively tune her out when he senses this effect.
        This Charm imposes a difficulty penalty on all rolls to
        attack, dodge or otherwise influence the Sidereal equal
        to her Performance.

        In taking those actions she considers necessary,
        whatever the personal cost, a Sidereal sets her order on
        the world. As she does so, it helplessly yields its Essence
        to her. This Charm draws on the Exalt's ability to play
        spirits and the world, manipulating Creation in Creation's
        service. Immediately after a successful roll using Conviction
        or immediately after a Socialize roll that substantially
        changed the local social environment in her favor, the
        Exalt regains twice her Conviction in motes of Essence,
        up to her normal maximum. There is no cost to use this
        Charm's effects - learning this Charm simply enhances
        the Exalt's capabilities.

        The character blots the target's name from the rolls
        of those destined to attract love. The target has an
        effective Appearance 1 for all non-magical effects. To
        invoke any form of supernatural appeal or to maintain it
        into a new scene, the target must spend a Willpower
        point, and his player must succeed at a Manipulation +
        Socialize roll against a difficulty of the Sidereal's Essence.
        He makes this roll after paying for the Charm or
        Ability used. If anyone with permanent Essence less than
        the Sidereal's own has romantic feelings for the target,
        those feelings are instantly severed. They do not return
        when the Charm ends.

        Quickly sketching a proposed relationship in the
        plans for future fate, the character increases the power
        one person has over another. The character names the
        fashion in which the beneficiary acquires dominion over
        the target — generally fear or desire, sexual or otherwise.
        The player rolls Manipulation + Socialize. To resist
        being intimidated, enthralled or impressed to the point
        of near-servitude, the target must spend one temporary
        Willpower per scene where he encounters the Charm's
        beneficiary. When he has spent Willpower equal to the
        number of successes rolled, the compulsion fades. Normally,
        the emotional impact does not entirely dissipate
        so much as mute itself to non-magical levels. The Sidereal
        can choose herself as the beneficiary. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Conviction with this Charm.

        As with legal crimes, the right tricks can make social
        crimes... disappear. The Sidereal can instantly erase the
        onus attached to herself or to someone else for some
        social blunder or taboo violation. Her player rolls Manipulation
        + Socialize. A single success makes people
        stop caring. With three successes, the character can
        choose instead either to make the relevant action generally
        acceptable or to make the person who committed it
        an admirable rebel (e.g., an ideologue who makes a bold,
        daring statement by digging up people's dead grandmothers,
        however disgusting that behavior would be in
        others). The Charm only affects communities where the
        relevant action significantly contributes to the target's
        notoriety. (To make theft socially acceptable through-
        out Creation, the Sidereal would have to arrange an act
        of theft infamous throughout Creation.) Socially acceptable
        acts often retain legal penalties. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Temperance with this Charm.

        The character wraps himself in the tenor of fate that
        gives rise to lust. He becomes impossible to recognize.
        Looking upon him, others perceive only a blazing sense
        that he is their greatest possession and that to harm or
        disappoint him is to risk losing their own hearts. For
        those actively hostile to him, it requires a Conviction
        roll to attack. For others, it requires a Temperance roll
        not to act as best they can, short of suicide, to please him.
        This Charm adds the character's Essence in automatic
        successes to any seduction roll.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses two prayer strips marked with the
        scripture of the Whore. The character holds them up,
        one at a time, and names a target for each. The targets
        must be within 10 miles. Each prayer strip burns lambent
        blue for a moment before disappearing, reappearing
        wrapped around one of its target's bones. Its light cannot
        shine through even the thinnest veil of flesh, but bursts
        forth brilliantly if that flesh is ever cut away. Extracting
        the strip requires 12 successes on an extended Dexterity
        + Medicine roll. Each attempt inflicts one level of
        unsoakable lethal damage.&lt;br&gt;
        The Sidereal's player rolls Manipulation + Socialize
        against the Essence of each target. If he succeeds both
        times, the character can dictate a new social and emo-
        tional relationship between the two targets. As fast and
        hard as plausible, for the duration of the Charm, events
        push the victims toward that social relationship. The
        imposed emotional relationship is partly a magical com-
        pulsion, which remains while the character commits
        Essence to the Charm. Under its influence, a target must
        spend a Willpower point to act significantly at odds with
        the imposed emotional context. The Charm also in-
        stantly creates genuine emotions, which do not depend
        on magic to sustain them. They fade or blossom as
        emotions normally do.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        The mirror of adjusting circumstances to meet one's
        needs is adapting one's needs to things found in one's
        circumstances. Both allow for the smooth progress of
        fate. This Charm lets an adaptable Exalt fire anything no
        heavier than her fist and no longer than her arm as if it
        were an arrow, including handfuls of dust or fire, shouts,
        dragonflies, small spirits or shadows. Living things can
        avoid the Sidereal seizing and launching them with a
        reflexive Dexterity + Dodge roll against a difficulty equal
        to the Sidereal's Archery score. Upon impact, an improvised
        arrow inflicts damage as a normal arrow of any type
        (Exalt's choice), in addition to any unusual effects appropriate
        to the attack. Sidereal Exalted can only shape
        arrows from concrete things, although the Maiden of

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Clay Maiden. The Exalt casts it into the
        sky, where it radiates a gaudy pink light, hovering 10
        yards above her bow.&lt;br&gt;
        For the duration of this Charm, the character's
        arrows have triple their normal range. In addition, for 1
        experience point each, the Sidereal can learn transformations
        to apply to an arrow as it falls, reshaping it into
        some other aspect of Creation. Commonly known trans-
        formations include:&lt;br&gt;
        • Rain of fire: The arrow turns into a rain of fire,
        attacking and applying its normal damage to all creatures
        within five yards of the target, setting flammable things
        alight, and ignoring armor on a successful hit.&lt;br&gt;
        • Snow: It begins to snow around the region where
        the arrow fell. The character must renew this effect with
        at least one arrow per minute to maintain it.&lt;br&gt;
        • Life: The target is healed for one level of lethal or
        bashing damage.&lt;br&gt;
        • Grain: A small patch of ripe wheat, enough to
        feed one person for a day, sprouts where the arrow lands.
        • Boulder: The arrow turns into an unblockable
        boulder as it falls. It can be dodged. Double the raw
        damage of the attack, including extra successes, when
        used against inanimate objects.&lt;br&gt;
        • Glass: The arrow becomes transparent as it falls.
        Targets must make a reflexive Perception + Awareness
        roll at difficulty 2 to defend against it without the use
        of Charms.&lt;br&gt;
        Each such arrow costs 1 mote of Essence to fire.
        Living or heavily worked &amp;quot;arrows&amp;quot; based on the Generalized
        Ammunition Technique cannot suffer
        transformations, nor can arrows made from the Five
        Magical Materials.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters can learn transformations from other
        Exalted with this Charm. They can also design new
        transformations, with the Storyteller's approval. Effects
        should be simple and should not directly duplicate the
        effects of other Charms.

        The character chooses the arc of his blow and writes
        it into forthcoming fate. One attack made using Brawl
        cannot be blocked. If it hits, the target's armor provides
        no protection.

        The character adapts to the conditions of the battlefield,
        rewriting the course of events so that they aid
        rather than hinder her. She makes a Brawl attack,
        suffering no environmental or circumstantial penalties
        and adding up to her Essence in dice. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Compassion with this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character mirrors her personal Essence to that
        of her enemies. When she strikes at a demon, this Charm
        wreathes her fists in a hideous red glare. When she
        attacks the servants of the Malfeans, her hands burn an
        undifferentiated white. Herunarmed attacks and attacks
        using starmetal brawling aids do lethal damage against
        ordinary foes and aggravated damage against inhabitants
        of Malfeas and the Underworld. This Charm can be
        invoked during a clinch, and its effects apply to a
        character's clinching damage. Its effects also apply to
        barehanded Martial Arts attacks.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Coming to an accommodation with an enemy's
        movements, the character learns to interrupt an enemy's
        strike an instant before it happens. If the character is
        aware of an incoming hand-to-hand attack, she can
        reflexively counterattack. A well-executed Crimson
        Palm Counterstrike knocks the enemy out of position:
        He overreaches or stumbles and cannot complete his
        attack. The Sidereal's player makes a single Dexterity
        + Brawl roll at her full dice pool. Count the
        number of successes. Apply these successes first as a
        parry, even against a lethal attack, to resolve the initial
        blow. Then, apply the remainder as successes received
        on an immediate Brawl counterattack.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can only use this Charm if she's able
        to attack and cannot use it in response to Crimson Palm
        Counterstrike or other any counterattack Charm. Otherwise,
        the parry and counterattack succeed or fail
        independently - she can knock her opponent aside
        without damaging him, or vice versa.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Drowning Maiden. The character knots
        it into her shadow, where it shimmers a soft scarlet.
        Once per invocation of this Charm, the character
        can strike a fate-resolving blow, sending cascading vibrations
        through the weave of the world. She dictates a
        single event or circumstance. The dictum must be a
        feasible occurrence, although it can be highly improb-
        able: Reinforcements might arrive, a wall might
        spontaneously crumble, or the character's fallen army
        might turn out to be bruised and unconscious rather than
        wounded and dead. Legions of tyrant lizards cannot fall
        from the sky and set upon the foe.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt's player rolls Intelligence + Brawl. The
        difficulty is the Essence of the highest-Essence entity
        directly and unpleasantly affected by the character's
        dictum. If she succeeds, that enemy has a choice. Either
        the character's dictum comes to pass, or the tremors in
        the weave ground through that enemy — inflicting dice
        of aggravated damage equal to the Sidereal's Essence,
        plus one die per extra success on the Brawl roll. This
        damage ignores armor. The attempted use of a defensive
        Charm nullifies the damage entirely; instead, the
        dictum takes effect.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted can always use their Valor with this
        Charm. Using this Charm without authorization is a
        Severity 3 offense.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The patterns and flows of a battlefield hold no
        mysteries for the character. She does not need to improvise
        last-second defenses. She notices openings well
        before they appear. She can choose her blows precisely,
        selecting multiple actions that combine harmoniously.
        In the turn in which she invokes this Charm, the
        character can take two extra attack actions, using Archery,
        Brawl, Melee or Thrown. Sidereal Exalted may
        always use their Temperance with this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is explicitly permitted to be in a
        Combo with Charms of other Abilities. Note that the
        rules on Combos may limit the kinds of actions a
        character can take.

        Calm and precision envelops the character as she
        strikes. She adds dice to one Melee attack, increasing it
        to a maximum of its normal pool plus the character's
        Essence. For example, an Essence 3 character who has a
        - 1 wound penalty can spend up to 4 motes to enhance her
        attack. This can overcome penalties that reduce the
        character's dice pool to 0 before Charms. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Temperance with this Charm.

        A wind full of red stardust and the character's will,
        visible to those who can see dematerialized spirits, spins
        around the character. It reroutes the flows of Essence and
        fate that normally allow others to attack her. A casual
        movement of the Exalt's weapon parries any one incoming
        attack she is aware of, so long as the attack has a
        physical component and is not specifically noted as
        impossible to block. This is not a perfect defense.

        Stirring the currents of fate with the tip of her weapon,
        the character disrupts the path of any attack made against
        her, so long as it passes through any portion of the world
        bound by fate. If she is unaware of the attack, her player
        must make a reflexive Perception + Melee roll at difficulty
        3 to divert the blow. Otherwise, this is a perfect block,
        capable of stopping even unblockable attacks.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden on the Shelf. The character
        places it across his eyes, whereupon it adheres and begins
        to drip with dark blood.
        The character suffers no visibility penalties. All
        opponents and attacks become apparent to him, although
        effects such as the Mental Invisibility Technique can
        force him to ignore them. He sees enemies not as bodies
        and faces but as patterns of fate and potential or — for
        creatures outside of fate — disruptions in such patterns.
        The character can reflexively parry any blockable
        attack with his full Dexterity + Melee dice pool. Once
        per turn, after his initiative, he can reflexively make an
        Archery, Brawl, Melee or Thrown attack at his full dice
        pool. He cannot use the latter ability in any turn where
        he splits his normal dice pool.

        In her moments of greatest accomplishment, the
        force of an exultant Sidereal's will allows her to siphon
        Essence from the world. This Charm draws on her ability
        to single-handedly remake the world in the shape she
        favors and dominate those hostile to herself and her
        cause. Immediately after a successful roll using Valor or
        immediately after a Presence roll that bent an enemy to
        her will, the Exalt regains twice her Valor in motes of
        Essence, up to her normal maximum. There is no cost to
        use this Charm's effects — learning this Charm simply
        enhances the Exalt's capabilities.

        The character impresses the fervent force of his
        personality on another person's future. When next the
        target finds himself in a specified circumstance, the
        Sidereal can use Performance, Presence or Socialize as if
        the Exalt were there. His player makes a single Ability
        roll, which Charms cannot augment. This uses the target's
        actions as a medium but does not change those actions —
        rather, it gives them an unexpected emotional resonance
        and unusual connotations. For example, the target could
        enter the court of a king of thieves and discover that her
        actions inadvertently comprise a Presence roll to con-
        vince that court that she must die. Using this Charm
        voids any previous Presence in Absence Technique effects
        on the target. The Sidereals cannot annotate a
        single person's destiny with dozens of future rolls.

        Sidereal's Nature in addition to his own. Both Natures
        are equally strong, and both help the target regain
        Willpower. The target proceeds normally, given that he
        has discovered an entirely new kind of joy/self-satisfaction,
        and while generally inclined to follow both Natures,
        does not need to give either precedence.

        decision the Sidereal desires. The Sidereal's player makes
        a Manipulation + Presence roll with a difficulty equal to
        the target's Essence. Success indicates that the target
        will make the decision the Sidereal desires.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 8 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One battle&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm gives the character supernatural acu-
        men and insight when planning a battle. It functions
        automatically when the Sidereal commands the troops
        herself. Otherwise, it requires a Charisma + Presence roll
        to properly convey the Sidereal's ideas to the leader of
        the side she favors. This roll has difficulty 1 for a coop-
        erative leader, difficulty 3 for a leader who does not trust
        the Sidereal and difficulty 5 if the leader is actively
        unwilling to accept the Sidereal's advice.&lt;br&gt;
        Fighting those blessed by a Sidereal's insight is
        difficult. If the Exalt succeeds, opponents suffer a one-die
        penalty to their dice pools for both attacking and defend-
        ing against the troops. Sidereal Exalted can always use
        their Compassion with this Charm.

        Essence-Draining Battle Pattern&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 8 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Until the relevant battle ends&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Predestined Triumph Practice&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Having applied the Predestined Triumph Practice,
        the character may encourage his troops to fight in the
        Essence-Draining Battle Pattern. Their elegant maneuvering
        dams, blocks and diverts the flows of Essence that
        oppose them.&lt;br&gt;
        At any time while planning an impending battle,
        the character can elect to use this Charm. When the
        battle begins, the player rolls the Sidereal's Intelligence
        + Presence to measure the character's efficiency in
        designing the pattern and the troops' ability to follow it.
        The maximum number of successes achievable equals
        the Exalt's permanent Essence. Any further successes are
        lost. The pattern has a Perfection rating equal to this
        final number of successes.&lt;br&gt;
        One Exalt or 20 unExalted warriors can spend an
        action to enact part of the Sidereal's battle plan. The
        altered Essence flows of the battlefield pour 1 mote of
        temporary Essence into each character enacting the
        plan. In addition, they each add the pattern's Perfection
        to the Essence cost of Charms and sorcery used by their
        opponents. Any number of characters can take this
        action in a given turn, each further increasing the
        difficulty of hostile magic. However, this cannot more
        than double the cost for a Charm or spell. The Essence-
        Draining Battle Pattern affects any hostile Charm or
        sorcery that either originates upon the battlefield or has
        direct effects there.&lt;br&gt;
        For example, if the character has Essence 5, and his
        player rolls five or more successes, and six Dragon-
        Blooded under his command fight in the Essence-Draining
        Battle Pattern, Charms and sorcery used against the
        character's forces cost up to 30 motes extra. Sledgehammer
        Fist Punch costs 8 motes instead of 3. Rain of Doom
        costs 90 motes instead of 60. Once upon a time, legions
        of well-advised Dragon-Blooded used this power to con-
        strain even the horrible power of the Primordials.&lt;br&gt;
        An army may only enact one Battle Pattern-type
        Charm. Sidereal Exalted can always use their Compassion
        with this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Having applied the Predestined Triumph Practice,
        the character may encourage her troops to fight in the
        Demon-Blocking Battle Pattern. Their formations are
        attuned to the disruptions in fate that the creatures of
        Malfeas and the Underworld embody, and by mirroring
        and twisting that disruption, the warriors can keep the
        threads of fate running straight and true.&lt;br&gt;
        The character invokes this Charm exactly as with
        the Essence-Draining Battle Pattern. One Exalt or 20
        unExalted warriors can spend an action to enact part of
        the pattern, imposing a general dice-pool penalty on an
        inhabitant of Malfeas or the Underworld equal to the
        pattern's Perfection. This cannot reduce the victim's
        pool below O before the use of Charms.&lt;br&gt;
        An army may only enact one Battle Pattern-type
        Charm. Sidereal Exalted can always use their Compas-
        sion with this Charm.

        Minimum Presence: 5&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Presence in Absence Technique, Force Decision, Essence-Draining Battle Pattern, Demon-Blocking Battle Pattern&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden at War. The character first
        applies the Predestined Triumph Practice and then burns
        the prayer strip. Only the symbols on it remain, drifting
        on the wind as letters of blood and smoke.&lt;br&gt;
        The Charm takes effect once the battle begins. The
        Sidereal names a spirit or elemental she hopes to call and
        bind. The Sidereal's location and invocation immediately
        becomes obvious to the spirit, wherever it may be.
        If the Sidereal uses this Charm unassisted, the spirit's
        maximum Essence is 5. However, up to one Sidereal of
        each other caste can support her, participating in the
        planning. They need not have the Charm themselves.
        Each adds 1 to the maximum summonable Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        The dice pool for summoning and binding the spirit
        starts at O. The death of one Exalted or 20 unExalted
        warriors on the Sidereal's side adds one die to this pool.
        Whenever the Exalt finds this dice pool satisfactory, the
        player rolls against the spirit's Essence. Success binds the
        spirit to grant whatsoever favor the character demands
        and exact no retribution — or to serve her for a year and
        a day, later taking whatever revenge it chooses. (Elder
        spirits often consider killing the Sidereal Exalted too
        crude a revenge, instead seeking to impose an equally
        demeaning slavery upon them.) Suicide and favors tantamount
        to it are outside the limits of this agreement.&lt;br&gt;
        An army may only enact one Battle Pattern-type
        Charm. Sidereal Exalted can always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        Hissing, the character expels the effects of any
        poison or drug affecting her, including alcohol, onto a
        future enemy. Her player adds up to the character's
        Essence in dice to a Resistance roll made to avoid the
        poison's effects. If the roll succeeds, the substance ceases
        to exist, except as a memo attached to her fate. It
        reappears, coalescing around her weapon, a moment
        before the next physical attack she makes that lets her
        player roll at least one die of lethal or aggravated damage.
        The full quantity of that poison or drug enters the
        bloodstream of the person she hit, with its normal effects.

        With a reflexive sacrifice of pain, the character
        binds fire or water to the defense of fate. If she touches a
        flame, flame cannot burn or suffocate her for the duration
        of the Charm. If she touches a body of water, water
        cannot freeze, boil, sicken or drown her. Her allies and
        the things she cares for also fall under this protection.
        In addition, while touching a spirit or elemental of
        fire or water - which may require a Brawl or Martial
        Arts action - the character can reflexively invoke this
        Charm. Her player rolls Charisma + Resistance against
        a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence to coerce it into
        service. This service must take the form of protecting
        something reasonably concrete. The Sidereal dictates
        what the spirit must protect. The spirit cannot retaliate
        for the Charm's duration. This Charm automatically
        expires at Calibration, and cannot be applied during that
        time. Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        Snarling fate with a twist of her hand, the character
        passes damage she might have suffered on to another.
        After damage is rolled but before it is applied, the
        Sidereal's player makes a reflexive Dexterity + Resistance
        roll. Each two successes allow the Exalt to transfer
        one level of undodgeable, unblockable and unsoakable
        damage to her attacker or one of her attacker's allies
        (who must be present) rather than taking it herself. She
        cannot transfer more damage than she originally took
        She transfers bashing damage to others as bashing damage.
        She transfers lethal and aggravated damage to others
        as lethal damage. If her target uses a perfect dodge such
        as Seven Shadow Evasion, a perfect block such as the
        Heavenly Guardian Defense or a perfect soak Charm
        such as the Adamant Skin Technique, neither the target
        nor the Sidereal suffer the transferred damage.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the One-Handed Maiden. The character
        casts it into the air and night's darkness falls around her.
        The prayer strip burns like a hot coal, hovering near her
        and casting a flickering red light over the side of her face.
        When any effect does her harm, the Exalt can tangle the
        destiny of any number of visible targets with her own.
        This is a reflexive action costing 3 motes per target. She
        invokes this effect after all damage or deleterious effects
        are rolled but before they are applied. Her targets suffer
        the same effects from the attack as the Exalt. Only
        perfect dodges such as Seven Shadow Evasion, perfect
        blocks such as the Heavenly Guardian Defense and
        perfect soak Charms such as the Adamant Skin Technique
        protect against this Charm.

        The Maidens grant many of their Chosen this gift,
        that keeps them clear-eyed and ever-alert for the patterns
        in the stars that inform them of the needs of destiny. This
        is actually five Charms, one for each Maiden.
        Auspicious Prospects for Journeys helps the character
        know when someone really ought to travel and,
        possibly, where. Auspicious Prospects for Serenity helps
        a character locate appropriate love matches or determine
        whom fate wishes to have joy. Auspicious Prospects
        for Battles hints at when and where and among whom a
        battle or war ought to take place. Auspicious Prospects
        for Fate — the Maiden of Secrets' Charm - gives
        insights into the proper overall direction of the world
        and the character's own life. Auspicious Prospects for
        Endings suggests when something might best pass from
        Creation. These Charms provide appropriate knowledge
        when the Storyteller so chooses.&lt;br&gt;
        This knowledge almost never gives a direct benefit
        to the character. More often, it provides her with goals
        to strive for! So, she must satisfy herself with the joy of
        service — and the ability to investigate the claims of
        other Sidereal Exalted, with a mote of Essence and a
        successful Intelligence + Investigation roll, when they
        assert that some fate or other is favorable or necessary.
        Any Sidereal can purchase any of these Charms. All
        five are favored for the Chosen of Secrets. The other
        Sidereal Exalted favor only their own caste's Charm.

        When a character learns this Charm, she weaves a
        thread of aquamarine mystery into her eyes. From that
        moment forward, she and the essence of fate that makes
        for secrets are kin. The things of mystery and enigma
        wear a faint, joyous glamour in her eyes. Conversely,
        secrets go out of their way to provide the kinds of
        evidence the character likes best. This Charm adds up to
        the character's Essence in automatic successes to an
        Investigation roll. If possible, the character chooses
        what kind of evidence she finds - a murder weapon, a
        book shelved right next to her, notes stuffed in such a
        book, footprints or something of that ilk. Whatever she
        finds, she finds instantly. Sidereal Exalted may always
        use their Compassion with this Charm.

        jubilant construct of Essence in the shape of an small
        unmanifested emerald pattern spider. When so instructed
        by the invocation of this Charm, it races off along the
        weave of fate to locate some fact for the character — any
        available information neither generally lost nor actively
        concealed. Examples are the name of the local god-king
        or carpenter, how many years ago widow Esther lost her
        husband, the status of a given war, the number of oxen
        an old friend now owns, the temperature in Nexus and so
        forth. One turn later, it returns, whispering the information
        into the character's ear. The spirit is indestructible

        Clapping his hands, the Sidereal causes a small
        plant to grow into the shape of a dedicated scholar and
        observer. This creature has the statistics and appearance
        of a typical mortal (see Exalted, pp. 276-277) except that
        it has an Intelligence 3, Awareness 3, Investigation 4,
        Lore 2 and Linguistics and languages equal to the
        character's own. It happily assists with research and
        investigation in any desired fashion, carrying books and

        Under excessive stress, such as combat, it panics and

        human shape with a reapplication of this Charm.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of That Old Thing. The Sidereal forms a
        question or curiosity in her mind and plants the strip as
        if it were a seed. Over the course of the next day, it first
        develops roots and then sprouts into a tall mulberry tree.
        Local spirits of wood are drawn to visit it. They leave
        small gifts or secrets behind there. Five days later, the
        Sidereal can return. Her player rolls Charisma + Investigation.
        For each success, the Exalt finds both a piece of
        information useful in resolving her curiosity and a gift
        she will value beneath the tree. There are also various
        worthless offerings.&lt;br&gt;
        Returning earlier for faster answers is possible but
        may provoke the wrath of one or two wood spirits. The
        valuable gifts are generally trinkets that suit the character's
        tastes, but the Storyteller may include unique or important
        gifts for story reasons. Sidereal Exalted may always
        use their Compassion with this Charm.

        The character calls the weave of events to her. Thin
        tendrils of fate snake out from Creation to twine around
        each of her fingers, fading into phosphorescent green
        visibility for the final meter of their journey. If the
        character is in or ventures into the Wyld, she becomes a
        small island of stability and Creation, her destiny snuck
        into the abode of chance by craft, art and cunning.
        Neither the character nor anything within 10 yards of
        her suffers the touch of the Wyld.

        Again, the character summons the weave of events,
        but now, she crosses her wrists and deftly switches
        threads from one hand to the other as they materialize.
        If her player succeeds at a Wits + Larceny roll, the Exalt
        steals a portion of her target's destiny and can borrow up
        to her Essence in bashing and lethal soak, in damage dice
        or in dice from a specific pool (such as Dexterity +
        Melee). The target loses the use of that soak or those dice
        for the remainder of the scene. The character gains it.
        The Sidereal cannot borrow more soak or more dice than
        the target possesses. This Charm is partially cumulative:
        The Sidereal can filch many different things in one scene
        but cannot add to the same pool or soak twice. When a
        Sidereal borrows dice for a pool, this is a dice bonus
        added by a Charm and should be considered as such
        when determining the maximum effect of other dice-
        bonus Charms.

        Exalt can speak or think it. Make a reflexive Dexterity +
        Larceny roll with difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence
        for Fair Folk to notice and substitute another name
        for their own before the Sidereal completes the theft.

        Bumping casually into his target or otherwise making
        physical contact, and after a successful Wits + Larceny
        roll with difficulty equal to the target's Essence, the
        character pockets his victim's dreams. Fair Folk suffer
        the character's Essence in dice of aggravated damage,
        ignoring armor, as the character dexterously unweaves
        some of the dream Essence from their Wyld nature. They
        immediately become ravenous and slightly mad, though
        sane enough to Dodge further attempts by the character
        to touch them. Any other characters affected by this
        Charm become listless: Until the Sidereal stops committing
        Essence to this Charm and thereby releases their
        dreams, they cannot regain Willpower and do not regenerate
        Essence naturally. Sidereal Exalted may always use
        their Temperance with this Charm.

        becoming all but invisible. To the eyes of any criminal,
        the character seems to have the virtues and qualities that
        best qualify her for respect and admiration. The Sidereal
        can reduce the target number of all peaceful or defensive
        interactions with rogues, scum and knaves.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Savory Maiden. The Sidereal holds it up
        before him, whereupon it straightens and affixes itself to
        reality as if nailed to the air, occasionally emitting an
        effulgence of green light. The Sidereal then names his
        victim, who must be within 10 miles. For a moment, the
        victim sees the prayer strip through the Exalt's eyes,
        burning a brilliant green. Ancient forces set in motion by
        the Charm wheel and deal with the Wyld, trading the
        victim's destiny to chaos in exchange for a portion of
        chaos claimed into Creation.&lt;br&gt;
        The Sidereal's player rolls Manipulation + Larceny.
        Each success represents one month of this curse, and in
        each month, the Wyld's efforts intensify — they're not
        organized, conscious or directed, as a whole, but they're,
        nevertheless, malevolent. The Charm draws Fair Folk
        and Wyld-spawned monsters to the target, their schemes
        and determination deadlier as time goes on. The victim
        suffers a derangement (see Exalted, p. 281) or a taint (see
        Exalted: The Lunars, pp. 219-221) as the order and laws
        that bind her deteriorate, though she may overcome this
        for a scene with a successful Temperance roll. However,
        when the curse expires, or when the Wyld has claimed its
        due, something in the chaos understands that the Maid-
        ens have cheated it — that it has given more territory to
        order and reason than chaos has consumed. The Sidereal's
        name is marked. The more often he uses this Charm, the
        more likely he is to find himself hunted by the very forces
        he invokes.&lt;br&gt;
        The player of a victim of this Charm can make an
        extended Intelligence + Lore roll every month for her
        character to understand the nature of the curse. With six
        successes, she understands that the prayer strip was
        within 10 miles of her location at the time the curse fell
        and that its destruction can free her. Twelve successes
        gives her its precise location.

        The character sleeps, and the Maiden of Secrets grants
        her a vision of the projected plan for fate, from the moment
        of her waking until the end of Creation. A character
        trained to use this Charm can filter her perceptions and
        observe a small portion of the Loom of Fate, integrating it
        with her own extensive knowledge. Until the vision fades
        with her next dream, she adds a + 1 specialty of her choice,
        which applies to all relevant Abilities.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters can only spend Essence for this Charm
        while asleep. This can increase the specialty total for an
        Ability above +3, but the character cannot add more
        than three specialty dice to any given roll. These specialties
        are dice bonuses added by a Charm and should be

        Scuttling on the paths of fate are the seven Heptarchs
        of Tragedy, gods of those truths and futures displeasing to
        mortal eyes. Catching sight of a horror to come, they
        snatch up the knowledge of it and bind it in a living
        sepulcher that they cast into the earth. Gathering together
        for three hours and simultaneously invoking this
        Charm, a trinity of Exalted serving Serenity, Battles and
        Secrets can dredge such a sepulcher forth and witness an
        atrocity not yet come to pass. At any time within the next
        year, the player of each can make a single Lore roll as if
        the Sidereal were looking backward from the end of the
        Age of Sorrows. For example, having lost an important
        artifact, the character can roll to remember notable
        events wherein it is destined to appear. Five successes
        may lead him to it immediately, while one success may
        indicate only that the Maidens intend it to fall into the
        hands of a young Lunar hero &amp;quot;eventually.&amp;quot; Extrapolating
        another aspect of the weave from a glimpse of one horrific
        section of the Loom is difficult, even for the Exalted.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters can use this Charm, at most, once per
        month. Multiple uses are not cumulative. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Conviction with this Charm.

        Charting the paths of the future can help to resolve
        even the stickiest of situations. Gathering together for
        three hours and simultaneously invoking this Charm, a
        trinity of Exalted serving Journeys, Serenity and Endings
        map the paths of destiny and learn at least one method
        by which they may achieve a given goal. From a mechanical
        perspective, they learn the price of success at
        some endeavor — anything from &amp;quot;a few bumps and
        bruises&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;the destruction of your Circle and every-
        thing you believe in.&amp;quot; If the Sidereal characters choose to
        pay the price, they automatically achieve their goal;
        both the price and their victory occur in a narrative
        fashion in amongst other stories.&lt;br&gt;
        The paths lain out by these small prophecies are
        rarely optimal. Characters may reasonably decide to pur-
        sue the goals in their own fashion rather than following
        the prophecy (paying the price) or dropping the matter.
        The Storyteller should only slightly inflate the price for
        resolving a peripheral matter but set a prohibitive price
        for automatically resolving something central to the story.
        The characters still benefit, however, even when the
        price they pay is greater than what their own planning
        might provide. They are assured of success and can focus
        their attention and planning effort on other matters.

        The Sidereal weaves one of the nets of Neferuaten,
        made from filaments of destiny thinner than the distance
        between a stone and its shadow or a dog and its howl.
        These nets can catch and cling even to those things
        normally immune to the workings of destiny: not strong
        enough to impede a Primordial's course, but cunning
        enough to adhere to the nonexistent borders of Cecelyne,
        the Endless Desert, or hang like gossamer from a
        Deathlord's flesh. The Exalt can cast the net around any
        creature she can see. Success requires a Dexterity + Lore
        roll with difficulty equal to the target's Essence. After-
        ward, the net then exerts a slow, continual pull on the
        world around the target. In a circumstance the Sidereal
        names, all dice pools that oppose the target have their
        target number reduced by 1, to a minimum of 4. The net
        lasts a year and a day. Instead of rolling the attack, the
        Sidereal can spend a permanent Willpower to guarantee
        success. This also ensures that the net lasts long enough
        to fulfill her purpose in casting it, even if one must
        reckon that time in years. Multiple such nets may cover
        a single target. Sidereal Exalted may always use their
        Valor with this Charm.

        necessity and not by desire. Neither the character nor
        the spirit chooses what the favor might be. The spirit
        automatically knows the favor's nature, but the Exalted
        does not. Until the favor is paid, success at a Wits +
        Temperance roll with difficulty 3 is required for the spirit
        to initiate hostile action against the Exalt. (It can still
        reply to violence with violence.)

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden in Terror, which glows a sickly
        green as it curls and twists and sinks into the Sidereal's
        palm. It leaves behind a faint tracery of symbols in the
        tongue of the Old Realm.&lt;br&gt;
        When the Sidereal so chooses, he shows his palm to
        a target and names that victim's fate: which of the
        target's worst fears the world will realize, and how. The
        Exalt's player then rolls Intelligence + Lore. The target
        instantly loses the Sidereal's Essence plus the number of
        successes in temporary Willpower, to a minimum of 0,
        and twice that amount in motes of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        Under normal circumstances, although the character
        simply states what is preordained, the player chooses
        and names a fate and manner for its realization that he
        finds dramatically interesting. At the moment the character
        speaks, that event is destined. The Storyteller
        should suggest an alternative if that destiny simply
        cannot come to pass. Game events can alter this destiny
        and rescue the target, due to changes in departmental
        vision and the meddling of Primordials, but the target
        herself cannot avoid her doom.

        an appropriately colored light only visible to spirits and
        the Chosen of her caste. This light reveals unmanifested
        spirits to those who can see it. In addition, the Sidereal

        dealing with spirits or in Yu-Shan. This explicitly stacks
        with effects that add dice to her pool, even if it exceeds

        To help the character better untangle the threads of
        fate, impelled by the earliest laws of Creation, the
        patterns of Essence around the character sing. Charms,
        sorcery and other effects give rise to strange but fitting
        melodies. Spirits - manifested or otherwise — emit a
        soft and inadvertent noise, like the ringing of bells. Only
        Sidereal Exalted can hear this music.&lt;br&gt;
        Both the character and other Sidereals within earshot
        can detect the presence of enchantments and
        unmanifested spirits automatically. An Intelligence +
        Occult roll against difficulty 3 allows Sidereal Exalted
        with this Charm to identify the details of an enchant-
        ment, the approximate rank and job description for a
        given spirit or the minutiae of the local geomantic
        environment.

        and elementals with the Sidereal's Essence or lower must

        against the character. In addition, each Charm they use
        in a conflict they initiate costs 1 additional Willpower.
        (This includes Charms that do not normally cost Will-

        Wrapped in the terrible grandeur of the Maiden
        that sponsors her, the Sidereal can present a compelling
        case for her intentions. If her player succeeds at a
        Charisma + Occult roll against a difficulty equal to the
        target's Essence, the Sidereal acquires a god's support
        in some political matter. The god must not be intractably
        opposed to the Sidereal, and the Sidereal can
        attempt this Charm at most once per year against a
        given target. When used by the losing side in a celestial
        audit, each use of this Charm counts as an independent
        Severity 3 offense. When used by the winning side,
        there is no penalty. (Helping others agree with the
        truth, as the censor's final opinion defines it, is no
        crime.) Sidereal Exalted may always use their Valor
        with this Charm. Learning this Charm requires the
        appropriate Maiden's approval.

        Sidereals with a deep understanding of the ways of

        of fate. With a deft touch on the weave, the character
        corrupts the pattern of a person's existence with the
        essence of chaos and endings. She inflicts her Essence in
        dice of unsoakable aggravated damage on any creature or
        object she can see. This damage cannot be blocked or
        dodged. The Unweaving Method cannot harm the dead
        and has no effect on characters or items shielded from
        the influence of the Wyld.

        itself has an Essence cost, often very high, that the
        character must pay to actualize the spell. This cost is

        Celestial Circle spell, they must also sacrifice a prayer
        strip inscribed with the scripture of the Maiden in
        Chains, which burns away in a gout of emerald fire.
        Celestial Circle Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.

        Using this Charm, the character reduces this deformation,

        any roll to remain undetected.

        Quiet as the Void, the Sidereal steps entirely out of
        the weave of fate. Only those with Essence greater than
        her own can sense her directly. The touch of chance
        allows others a reflexive Perception + Awareness roll
        for others to feel a presence nearby. Even if they
        succeed, those who cannot sense her directly have a +2
        difficulty penalty on attempts to attack her or affect her
        with Charms. Only supernatural trackers can engage in
        tracking contests with the character. The Exalt returns
        instantly to the weave if her anima banner makes
        Stealth Charms fail.&lt;br&gt;
        For the duration of this Charm, the Sidereal is
        treated as a creature outside of fate. Learning this Charm

        player must make a Perception + Awareness roll at
        difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence to realize that
        the thoughts are not his own.

        Technique, Blinding the Boar
        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of Absence. The character places it upon
        her chest. Flashing with dark green light, it sinks
        inside and wraps around her heart. In that instant, the
        Sidereal vanishes from the weave of fate and reap-
        pears elsewhere, woven seamlessly into a new life. No
        effect that targets the Sidereal based on her identity
        rather than her physical location functions. For the
        time being, although others remember her, the Sidereal
        simply does not exist.&lt;br&gt;
        The character creates a new identity and appearance
        for herself as any sort of non-Primordial
        creature, including mortals, Exalted, spirits and the
        dead. She cannot, however, become someone who
        already exists.&lt;br&gt;
        The character chooses up to 15 dots of Back-
        grounds appropriate to her new life; Background dots
        above 3 cost double. She travels instantly to a loca-
        tion chosen by the Maiden of Secrets to fit her new
        identity. She instantly develops appropriate social
        relationships, seamlessly integrating into the life of
        any appropriate entities save creatures of the Wyld,
        beings outside the pattern of fate and spirits on or
        above the level of the Maidens. Thus, if the character
        chose to assume the identity of an Abyssal Exalted,
        the dead of her &amp;quot;native&amp;quot; shadowland would recognize
        and remember her as such, but the Deathlord that was
        her ostensible superior would not.&lt;br&gt;
        The character does not gain new Abilities.
        When possible, others perceive her Charms and
        anima as effects suitable to her new self. When
        magic or ignorance betrays the character, she
        automatically receives a perfect success on social rolls
        to explain the matter away. Others have no difficulty
        perceiving or remembering the Sidereal's temporary
        identity, unless the temporary identity is itself a
        Sidereal. However, the character's tendency to fade
        from view prevents her from spending more than one
        season a year as another person.&lt;br&gt;
        If the Sidereal dismisses this Charm or uses more
        than 10 motes of Peripheral Essence, the Charm
        ends. Its effects linger on for five days, after which
        the Sidereal snaps back to her old identity and its
        appropriate location.

        own future destiny for power, sacrificing a few days
        or weeks of lifespan to suffuse his physical form with

        than his Essence. These improvements add normally

        lifespan. Successes not paid for are lost. Increases to
        his Attributes are dice bonuses added by a Charm
        and should be considered as such when determining
        the maximum effect of other dice-bonus Charms.
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        With a single blow, the character consumes the
        destiny of an object, bringing that destiny partway
        toward or immediately to its final conclusion. When
        attempting to destroy an object with a feat of
        strength, the character can use this Charm to reduce
        the target number of the Willpower roll to
        boost her Strength + Athletics. If she succeeds at
        destroying the object, she recovers the Willpower
        point spent. Alternately, when attacking an object,
        the character can buy up to her Essence in additional
        points of damage at 1 mote each.

        For a moment, the character cuts the connection

        the air. She triples her leaping distance for a single jump.

        Eliding the moments of her own life between
        footsteps, or between the beginning of a gesture and its
        end, the character acts without the need for motion.
        She suffers no wound or armor penalties of any sort, nor
        any penalties that reduce her running speed. When
        characters first learn this Charm, their movements
        involve flickering shifts in their position — as if others
        saw them through a strobe light. With a few days'
        practice, however, they can smooth out this effect,
        moving with a fluid grace that appears to ignore normal
        anatomical constraints.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and the Dust. The character
        wraps it around his forehead or neck, whereupon it
        exudes a soft scent of lilacs and decay. For the rest of the
        day, the character receives the benefits of the Inexorable
        Advance Charm every turn. This continuous simplification
        of his movements also reduces the fatigue value of
        his armor by two, to a minimum of zero. A fatigue value
        of zero means that the character need never roll to see if
        he becomes fatigued from wearing the armor. In addition,
        the character can compress more action and more
        complex action into the fractional seconds of his life he
        skips over and reduces to instantaneousness. He doubles
        his movement rate and receives a number of automatic
        successes equal to his Athletics score to divide in any
        fashion among his physical actions every turn. The
        character can reserve some of these successes for reflexive
        actions later in the turn, but successes not used by the
        end of each turn are lost.

        Once a Sidereal commits Essence to this Charm, her
        perceptions constantly probe into the immediate future
        for anything that could do her harm. When the character
        is in danger, her player makes a reflexive Wits +
        Awareness roll. If she succeeds, the character has a
        feeling of ill ease that informs her of impending danger.
        The character gets a warning period of two minutes per
        success rolled. This Charm only allows the Sidereal to
        spot obvious harm: Slow-acting poison concealed in her
        ale would not set off the alarm, as the effect is too far in
        the future. However, it might be triggered just before the
        effects kick in, giving the character time to deduce the
        cause and seek a cure.

        The character has a general idea of the bad things
        that will happen to him in the course of his life. When
        an unpleasant moment impends, this awareness crystallizes.
        This Charm activates automatically when
        something unexpectedly dangerous or awful is about to
        happen, and the character learns its general nature
        (&amp;quot;attack,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;poison,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;betrayal,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;loss of loved one,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hu-
        miliation&amp;quot;). The character has one turn's warning in
        which to turn his fate aside. Ambushes against the
        character automatically fail, but the character does not
        automatically detect his attacker.

        The character can see the web of fate around her as
        it cascades into the unavoidable reality of the present.
        With this Charm, she can focus enough attention upon
        the influx of destiny to watch continuously, out to a
        distance of (her Essence x 100) yards, for specific disturbances
        in that web. She can either keep track of people
        within that region, monitor spirits within that region or
        watch for some specific phenomenon such as combat,
        the use of Essence or the mention of her name. She senses
        only vague details — specifically, she can identify the
        location and power level of what she sees and recognize
        specific effects or people she is familiar with, but she
        cannot follow the course of events. For example, when
        monitoring Essence use, she might recognize the invocation
        of the Expected Pain Charm, which she knows well.
        Unless she has seen it often, however, the Ten Ox
        Meditation (see Exalted, p. 196) would register only as
        an Essence 3 Charm. In neither case would she know the
        specific effects of the Charm, such as what object a Solar
        used Ten Ox Meditation to destroy. The effects of this
        Charm are cumulative: If a Sidereal uses it five times in
        a scene, she can monitor five different things.&lt;br&gt;
        Supernal Awareness does not rely on any of the
        character's senses. Normal Stealth and Charms that
        make the character physically invisible or silent have
        no effect.

        Life is full of choices. This Charm gives a Sidereal
        the edge on mere mortals by allowing him to make the
        best choice when confronted with many options. However,
        this Charm allows only a brief peek into the future,
        not an extended glimpse into all the consequences of the
        decision. The ideal short-term outcome is guaranteed,
        but long-term gains are not.

        No one can hide from their past. It unwinds inevitably,
        event cascading into event, rolling from the then
        into the now and finally into an inescapable collection
        of destinies. Characters with this Charm can track others
        not by the physical marks they leave on the world, but by
        the impressions their passage leaves on the destinies of
        everything around them. In a relatively uninhabited
        region, the character can follow a trail as old as one day
        per point of her permanent Essence. In a more populous
        region, where many people leave their marks on fate -
        and, more importantly, where those marks interact with
        one another in a progressively unruly and chaotic fash-
        ion — this Charm is less effective. In such places, the
        character is limited to following trails no older than one
        hour per point of her permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        This ability can be foiled by use of the Traceless
        Passage Charm (see Exalted, p. 182) and similar Charms.
        If the target uses such a Charm, resolve the matter with
        a standard opposed tracking contest.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and the Scythe. The character
        holds it up before her target. It fixes itself in the air
        and begins to blossom with pungent violet flowers,
        whose petals dry, fall off and turn to dust in the course
        of seconds, each replaced as it dies with another
        flower's blooming.&lt;br&gt;
        The target of this Charm finds himself caught in a
        vision of his own ending: transported to a likely end for
        his life, a few hours, minutes or turns before its conclusion
        comes. Roll his permanent Willpower against a
        difficulty of 3. Success indicates that the Charm fazes
        him but has no other effect. Failure indicates that he
        returns from the vision deeply shaken. Reduce his temporary
        Willpower to 1. His Personal Essence pool is
        instantly lost; reduce his temporary Essence by the amount
        of his Personal Essence, to a minimum of 0. He cannot
        recover Willpower or personal Essence for the remainder
        of the scene.&lt;br&gt;
        If the victim is a Storyteller character, the rules
        above suffice. Otherwise, the Storyteller should play
        the vision out. This occurs at a convenient time:
        immediately, as the next scene, or at the end of the
        session, depending on the play group's style. The Sto-
        ryteller devises an interesting and ideally appropriate
        scenario for the target's most likely ending. As events
        progress, the target can alter the scenario in one small
        way for each point of permanent Essence he possesses.
        Motes, Willpower, experience points and health levels
        spent or recovered in the vision do not affect the
        character's actual totals.&lt;br&gt;
        If, through interesting roleplay, luck or martial
        cleverness, the target manages to survive his impending
        doom, he suffers no permanent ill effects. Further, when
        he finishes processing the vision, a few scenes later, he
        generally recovers his full temporary Willpower.&lt;br&gt;
        If the target dies in the vision but his player made his
        permanent Willpower roll, above, the character suffers
        no permanent ill effects save disquiet.&lt;br&gt;
        If the target dies in the vision and failed his permanent
        Willpower roll, his player must roll the character's
        permanent Essence and permanent Willpower. (He cannot
        spend Willpower on these rolls.) Failure on either
        roll means losing one dot of the appropriate Trait, to a
        minimum of 1. No matter what he rolls, he cannot
        recover his Personal Essence for the remainder of the
        story. He only has access to Peripheral Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm has no effect on Abyssal Exalted or the
        dead. It specifically affects Second and Third Circle
        demons, despite their normal immunity to Willpower
        loss from Sidereal Charms.

        In demonstrating her superiority to the frantic masses
        that mill about her, a calm and settled soul becomes a
        natural sinkhole for the Essence of the world. This
        Charm draws on a Sidereal's ability to keep perspective
        and maintain her tranquility in the most troubled circumstances,
        easily juggling a hundred projects and a
        thousand data points, controlling herself always and
        controlling others when necessary. Immediately after a
        successful roll using Temperance or immediately after a
        Bureaucracy roll that substantially helped her implement
        her agenda, the Exalt regains twice her Temperance
        in motes of Essence, up to her normal maximum. There
        is no cost to use this Charm's effects - learning this
        Charm simply enhances the Exalt's capabilities.

        immediately after touching a target bureaucrat, which,
        for unwilling targets, requires an unarmed attack (which
        need do no damage). The Sidereal's player rolls Charisma
        + Bureaucracy against the target's Essence. If
        successful, the target is compelled to perform his duties
        honestly for the duration of the Charm.&lt;br&gt;

        Sometimes, all it takes to kill a god is a word in the
        right ear. To invoke this Charm, the Exalt's player
        rolls Charisma + Bureaucracy against a difficulty equal
        to the target's Essence. Normally, this files a petition
        in the Bureau of Endings, activating certain perquisites
        of the Chosen of Fate that facilitate quick,
        effective resolution of a conflict with a spirit or elemental.
        However, due to the terms of the Primordials'
        surrender, this Charm specifically affects demons of
        all Circles and adds the Sidereal's Essence in auto-
        matic successes against them.&lt;br&gt;
        The effects of the Charm are as follows. Whether
        the character succeeds or fails, the spirit must instantly
        manifest and materialize to meet the Sidereal's calm
        gaze. It cannot dematerialize until the end of the scene.
        If the character succeeds, the spirit becomes additionally
        vulnerable. If its materialized body dies that scene, the
        Sidereal can either destroy it utterly, bind it into an
        object, coerce it into service for an indefinite task or
        command its obedience for a year and a day. This can
        offer a Sidereal a second opportunity to bind a demon
        that breaks free of her control.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Temperance
        with this Charm. Learning this Charm requires the
        Maiden of Endings' approval.

        With this Charm, the character conceals his presence
        effectively from those who foolishly consider
        themselves his superiors. Anyone who knows of the
        Sidereal Exalted and looks down upon them, or who
        considers himself superior to all others, simply cannot
        detect the Sidereal. This invisibility also applies to those
        who consider themselves more important than or hierarchically

        &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; like there is somewhere the subject needs to be.
        Chosen of Serenity exude a faint sense of peace and
        happiness. Chosen of Battles provide a sense of intangible
        tension to the air. Chosen of Secrets provoke a
        strange sense of déjà vu. And the Chosen of Endings
        radiate a vague air of danger.&lt;br&gt;
        The arrogant cannot use the help of others to spot
        the Sidereal. Reports on the character's presence no
        more register than the character's direct visual impres-
        sion. However, victims can derive other information
        from such reports, such as &amp;quot;something bad is happening
        and is preventing me from hearing exactly what my
        friends are saying.&amp;quot; They can even target the Sidereal
        based on this kind of information and the faint impres-
        sion mentioned above. However, their dice pool for
        attacking or defending against the Sidereal starts at 0,
        before the effects of Charms. A perfect counter to invis-
        ibility (such as Eye of the Unconquered Sun — see Caste
        Book: Night, p. 75) overcomes this effect. This Charm
        conceals the last few seconds of a Sidereal's tracks.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm has no effect on other Sidereal Exalted
        Otherwise, the Storyteller always decides whether a
        Storyteller character falls victim to this Charm, and
        players of non-Sidereals can explicitly decide their char-
        acters' opinions on the Sidereal Exalted and specific
        Exalts. Learning this Charm requires the Maiden of
        Endings' approval.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden's Promise, which explodes in
        searing amethyst light as the character throws it to the
        ground. As the light fades, passion and the desire for
        speech drains from all those who witnessed the Charm.
        Everything has already been said.&lt;br&gt;
        If the character wishes, this Charm can instantly
        end a debate - leading into an immediate vote or to
        everyone dropping the matter, as circumstances dictate.
        Alternately, as long as one or more key individuals
        are present, End Debate can stop any bureaucratic pro-
        cess cold. Only an Intelligence + Bureaucracy roll with
        a difficulty equal to twice the character's permanent
        Essence can restart it.&lt;br&gt;
        Finally, if the Sidereal's player successfully rolls
        Strength + Bureaucracy against the target's Essence, this
        Charm can impose the effects of ley Hand on a single
        bureaucrat permanently — only by resigning his position
        (and, if desired, seeking another) can he reestablish a
        career of corruption.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Temperance
        with this Charm.

        The character trains himself for instant acceptance
        of the twists and turns of circumstance. In any given
        combat, in the first turn he acts, he doubles his base
        initiative (Dexterity + Wits). Charms such as Opportune
        Shot and Thunderclap Rush Attack do not automatically
        win initiative over him. These advantages cease to apply
        once he takes his first non-reflexive action. There is no
        cost to use this Charm - learning this Charm permanently
        enhances the Exalt's capabilities.

        The character moves with the swift precision of one
        who knows her destiny. For each mote of Essence spent,
        she adds one point to her initiative for the remainder of
        the scene. Multiple applications of this Charm are cumulative,

        Essence shines around the characters hands (or
        weapons), tracing with their every movement crim-
        son trails through the air. For each 2 motes spent, the
        character adds one die to each unarmed Martial Arts
        attack and parry she makes for the remainder of the
        scene. Multiple applications of this Charm are cumulative,
        but she cannot more than double her
        normal Dexterity + Martial Arts pool with any
        combination of effects. While under this effect, her
        hands may safely parry even lethal damage blows,
        although blocking arrows or magical attacks requires
        a well-described stunt.

        Those who routinely face terrible odds can learn to
        take some measure of happiness in each moment's
        survival. Once having activated this Charm, the player
        rolls the Sidereal's Essence each time the character
        successfully blocks or dodges an attack. Each success
        indicates two motes of Essence, flavored by the tang of
        Serenity, that she recovers. This Charm does not activate
        against attacks not truly intended to harm the
        Sidereal, nor against attacks from enemies too weak to
        do her any real harm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character adopts the cold detachment with
        which Saturn makes her Sign against those things whose
        time has passed. While the character uses the Violet Bier
        of Sorrows Form, each successful attack also drains some
        of the victim's passion. After damaging an opponent
        with an unarmed Martial Arts attack, the Exalt can
        remove one point of one of the target's Virtues, to a
        minimum of 1. This cannot reduce a target's Virtues
        below the minimums required for the Great Curse. For
        example, if a Solar's Virtue Flaw is Compassionate Martyrdom
        (see Exalted, p. 131), this Form cannot reduce
        his Compassion below 3. However, it can reduce a spirit,
        elemental or demon's Virtues below the minimum level
        necessary to use a given Charm, in which case the spirit
        loses access to that Charm until its Virtue recovers. Each
        Virtue heals at the rate of one point a day.
        This Form changes the normal minimum for damage
        dice. While it is active, after a successful and
        potentially damaging unarmed Martial Arts attack, the
        character always rolls at least her Martial Arts score in
        damage dice.
        This Charm is also called the &amp;quot;Endings Form.&amp;quot;

        &lt;br&gt;
        In a blur of violet Essence, the character's blade

        him. If the character tries and fails to parry a blockable
        attack, he may decide — after damage is rolled — to
        invoke this Charm, reducing the damage by one level
        per 2 motes spent.

        Drawing on the Essence of Endings, a character can
        add power to a blow that he realizes is about to pierce his
        enemy's defenses. As soon as a character hits an opponent
        with an unarmed attack, his player can declare the
        use of this Charm, purchasing automatic damage successes
        at a cost of 2 motes each. He cannot purchase more
        than his character's Essence in automatic successes. This
        Charm applies to unarmed Brawl attacks and is explicitly
        permitted to share a Combo with Brawl Charms; the
        disciplined approach of a martial artist is necessary only
        in the last instant of the blow.

        Not even the most cunning of opponents can evade
        a sword that strikes everywhere at once. For each 3 motes
        spent, the character can make an extra unarmed Martial
        Arts attack at her full dice pool. All her attacks must be
        made against the same target. She cannot make more
        total attacks than her Martial Arts, nor can she split her
        dice pool in the same turn she uses Metal Storm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        At the pinnacle of the Violet Bier of Sorrows
        Style, a character learns to draw strength from the pain
        of others. Her attacks gain resolve as her enemy falters.
        She is trained to take full advantage of the weakness of
        the wounded, stalking failing prey as death hunts those
        whose time has come. Whenever she successfully harms
        an opponent with an unarmed Martial Arts attack, she
        gains one point of Willpower. In addition, an
        opponent's wound penalties are tripled when it comes
        to attacking her or defending against her unarmed
        Martial Arts attacks.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted, and those who learn this Charm as
        a Sidereal Charm, can enhance it with a prayer strip
        marked with the scripture of the Expectant Maiden. The
        character fixes it to her sword (or other allowed weapon),
        wrapping the whole in a radiant burgundy light. While
        the prayer strip survives, her weapon cannot be destroyed,
        and each successful Martial Arts attack subtracts
        a Willpower point from the target. Creatures outside of
        fate and targets with 0 Willpower instead lose 10 motes
        of Essence. If the target does not have 10 motes to lose,
        convert all damage dice to automatic successes instead.

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm speeds and ensures a smooth transition
        from life to death. It instantly and painlessly kills any
        Incapacitated or dying target. The target cannot rise
        again as an undead. If applied to a corpse, neither the
        body nor spirit can rise again as an undead. Zombies
        instantly collapse. This power cannot target ghosts di-
        rectly, but if applied to the ghost's original body — not a
        body it happens to possess - it banishes the ghost
        instantly and permanently to the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;
        No Charm or ability protects the victim against
        Smooth Transition or activates in the moment of death.
        This is a perfect effect. However, extremely unusual
        corpses — such as spine chains — require a Charisma +
        Medicine roll to lay to rest, with difficulty equal to the
        Essence of the creature that raised them.&lt;br&gt;
        If the body of a target of this Charm is ever placed on
        naked earth or stone, it sinks quietly beneath the surface,
        arranging for its own burial.&lt;br&gt;
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Valor with
        this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        As with Smooth Transition, this Charm instantly,
        painlessly and perfectly kills its target. The target need not
        be dying, Incapacitated or even wounded but must be
        willing to pass into death. His consent cannot be forced, nor
        can it be forcibly withheld: The target dies if and only if he
        would decide to consent, given adequate time and comfort
        in which to think, while under the influence of neither drug
        nor Charm. The Sidereal Exalted can freely make the
        prospect of life as unpleasant as she desires. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Valor with this Charm.

        a Smooth Transition to all those within (his Essence x
        10) yards. If facing unusual corpses, his player makes only
        a single Charisma + Medicine roll; compare the number
        of successes received to the Essence of the Deathlord or
        deathknight who raised each given corpse to determine
        whether it falls. Sidereal Exalted may always use their
        Valor with this Charm.

        The character makes the Inferior Sign of the Corpse
        against the spirit of an illness, and it comes to its natural
        end. The Exalt's player makes an Intelligence + Medicine
        roll against the normal difficulty to treat the disease,
        adding her Essence in dice. If successful, the disease's
        course ends, the least god of the infection dies peacefully,
        and the target can begin recovery. This does not affect
        spiritual diseases (see pp. 195-201). Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Conviction with this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and the Road. The character
        buries it seven yards beneath the ground and covers its
        grave with stone. Ten spines of indigo light burst upward
        from the grave and explode into the sky - the Charm
        then takes effect. The Sidereal's intuition for fate leads
        her to the nearest spirit or elemental of the earth or the
        air who stands, for whatever reason, on the verge of
        death. If the Sidereal so chooses, she may offer it an
        opportunity to endure past its time. If it accepts, it binds
        itself to the Sidereal Exalted's soul and vanishes.&lt;br&gt;
        Until the Sidereal releases this Charm and the
        committed Essence, she recovers one lethal or bashing
        health level per turn. This action is a reflexive one that
        does not count against her actions for the turn. If she
        binds an earth entity rather than a creature of air, this
        regeneration functions only in contact with the earth or
        stone. In addition, her natural soak increases by (3L/3B)
        if she binds an air creature and (6L/6B) if she ties herself
        to the earth. This soak is not compatible with armor. The
        character does not choose which sort of elemental or
        spirit she finds. The matter is in Saturn's hands.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can transfer the bound spirit or elemental
        to another. From that point forward, that person
        benefits from the effects, and she does not. She cannot
        reclaim it once so transferred, although the Charm still
        ends when she stops committing Essence to it.&lt;br&gt;
        When the character ends the Charm, the elemental
        or spirit is born again from its host's soul. It does not
        return as quite the same entity and is often closer to the
        Exalt's strength than to its original power. It may or may
        not consider itself indebted, depending on its nature,
        how long the character left the Charm in force and
        whether the Sidereal had anything to do with its being
        on the verge of death in the first place.

<p>Charms in the Charcoal March of Spiders Style
treat attacks the Sidereal makes with knives or seven-section
staves, including serpent-sting staves, as
unarmed attacks. A stave represents the nimble leg of
a spider, while the knife represents its fang. Also treat
the wires/threads generated by certain Charms in this
style as unarmed attacks. If a Charm allows the character
to choose between issuing bashing or lethal damage,
this applies only to barehanded, staff-based and thread-based
attacks. A knife must do lethal damage.
Characters cannot use this style while wearing armor.</p>

        ...whose skill was great enough to climb a whirlwind
        over water.&lt;br&gt;
        The character scuttles on the threads of fate like a
        pattern spider. He can run through or stand upon the air
        as easily as on the ground. He can reflexively spend a
        mote of Essence to dematerialize from the beginning of
        his initiative to the beginning of his next initiative,
        allowing him to become as invisible and intangible as
        those who weave fate. This does not count against his
        actions for the turn. When he is under this Charm's
        influence, the Sidereal's gait both disturbs and horrifies
        those who see it. Except for the Sidereal's allies, the
        player of a witness who does not have this Charm must
        succeed at a difficulty 1 Valor roll each turn, or her
        character loses her action.

        Arrows fell upon her, forcing her to descend.
        This Charm emulates a spider's motion, balanced
        on six legs and striking with two, never lacking the
        leverage — regardless of what might tangle its blows —
        for a lightning retreat or advance. The character begins
        a shuffling, sliding, shifting kata, her feet constantly in
        motion and nearly impossible for mortal eyes to track.
        Only the third of three separate, successful attempts can
        sweep her, knock her down, clinch or hold her or make
        a targeted attack against her lower body.&lt;br&gt;
        When the character uses this kata, she can shift
        herself almost instantaneously out of the path of a blow.
        Becoming aware of a physical attack allows her to glide
        away, moving up to twice her Dexterity in yards. If the
        attack can hit her at this range — as with archery or the
        Lightning Strike Style (see Exalted: the Dragon-Blooded,
        p. 246) — this Charm increases any associated range
        penalties. Attacks that must hit her before she moves
        away (such as hand-to-hand attacks if she puts more than
        three yards between herself and her attacker) suffer a
        dice pool penalty equal to half the character's initiative
        for that turn, rounded up. After the first attack, the
        attacker must move into range again to hit her at all.
        Similarly, the character can glide forward up to twice her
        Dexterity in yards to make any of her unarmed Martial
        Arts attacks. Attempts to parry her attack suffer a dice
        pool penalty equal to half her initiative for the turn,
        rounded up. Dodging her requires less awareness of her
        angle of approach; dodge attempts only suffer a penalty
        equal to her permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        When a character uses this Charm to dart quickly
        through her enemies, splitting her Martial Arts action to
        maximize the extra movement derived from this Charm,
        it is sometimes called the Dance of the Pouncing Spider.
        When she uses it to skate away from a barrage of arrows,
        quickly exceeding their maximum range, it is the Dance
        of the Spider in the Rain.

        But the Essence burning within her set the arrows afire.
        The character's fingers rain across her opponent like
        a thousand poisoned fangs, tainting the target's Essence
        so that his soul begins to dissolve from the inside. The
        character makes a normal unarmed Dexterity + Martial
        Arts attack, which does normal damage. In addition, the
        target begins to hemorrhage Essence. He loses 5 motes
        every turn, exactly as if he had spent them. This effect
        lasts one turn for each damage die rolled. Multiple
        applications of this effect are cumulative. When the
        target runs out of motes, he collapses, comatose, for a
        number of days equal to the character's Martial Arts.
        Storyteller characters may die outright. Given three
        turns of physical contact with a comatose target, a
        character with this Charm can suck out and devour the
        target's soul. This restores the devourer's temporary
        Essence to its normal maximum. The target does not
        move on to the afterlife. If the character consumes a
        Celestial Exalt, she will grow sick sometime within the
        next three days and spit out the indigestible Celestial
        Essence, suffering six dice of lethal damage in the process,
        which ignores armor and soak.

        She answered the arrows' flight with a storm of her own.
        The character casts forth a number of hair-fine
        threads equal to his permanent Essence. Each can at-
        tempt one of the following maneuvers, at a range of (the
        Sidereal's Essence x 10) yards:&lt;br&gt;
        • Pick up a single unattended weapon or object.
        Attacking or parrying with a weapon held by a thread is
        a normal Martial Arts action.&lt;br&gt;
        • Pierce an opponent's skin, as a normal Martial
        Arts attack that does lethal damage.&lt;br&gt;
        • Disarm, sweep or hold an opponent (see Exalted,
        pp. 238-240). This attack uses the character's full Dexter-
        ity + Martial Arts pool and does not count against the
        character's actions. Further, the character can maintain
        a hold with his full Strength + Martial Arts pool, without
        losing or splitting his action, so long as he invokes this
        Charm every turn. However, each thread can hold only
        a single limb; a held character can take actions with her
        other limbs. If the character devotes multiple threads to
        holding an opponent, resolve the attack with a single roll.&lt;br&gt;
        Make reflexive Perception + Awareness or Perception
        + Martial Arts checks at difficulty 4 for other
        characters to see the threads. Otherwise, except for
        attacks with a visible weapon, targets are unaware of
        the attack and can only use defenses that specifically
        state they work on attacks the character is not aware
        of. The threads are tangible and slightly reflective,
        and opponents can use stunts to make them easier to
        spot or predict.

        And the small maiden began&lt;br&gt;
        Hundreds of near-invisible filaments spun from the
        character's Essence launch from her hands, whipping
        around physical and spiritual leverage points and weaving
        amongst themselves to snarl and tangle all opponents
        within (the Sidereal's Essence x 10) yards. Each turn, the
        Sidereal's player reflexively rolls Dexterity + Martial
        Arts. Enemies inside the Charm's area of effect, or who
        enter that area before the character's next turn, suffer a
        cumulative penalty to their dice pools for all physical
        actions equal to half the number of successes. They
        receive the same penalty to their natural movement rate
        in yards. This penalty fades by one die and one yard per
        turn that the victim spends outside the radius, as the
        threads reluctantly disentangle themselves.&lt;br&gt;
        The weave of thread moves with the character,
        easily catching new opponents brought into the radius
        and twitching out of the way of those she wishes to give
        unhampered passage. If the character does not keep
        moving, the threads thicken toward the point of visibility,
        first as glints of reflected light in the air, then a faint
        visual impression like cobweb and ultimately (after five
        minutes of stillness) an opaque forest of webbing around
        the character, as impassible - for those she does not
        offer passage to — as stone (use the statistics for Stone
        Wall on page 239 of Exalted for each one-yard cube
        attackers wish to clear).

        to climb the waterspout again.&lt;br&gt;
        The character moves in the fashion of an arachnid
        sifu, her hands weaving lazily through three sets of
        interwoven kata. Such is her grace and coordination, in
        Essence as in body, that she may take three fully independent
        physical actions in each turn. For example, she
        might invoke a full dodge when attacked, then invoke
        Flight of Mercury while making an ordinary Martial Arts
        attack and, finally, split her dice pool to use Maw of
        Dripping Venom against two nearby opponents.&lt;br&gt;
        Fully independent actions follow exactly the same
        rules as taking single actions on multiple successive
        turns, except that:&lt;br&gt;
        • Only one turn actually passes, which matters for
        some Charm effects and durations and also means the
        sutra discount applies only once.&lt;br&gt;
        • Characters who have split dice pools can interweave
        their actions. For example, they can split one
        action's dice pool between an attack and a parry, taking
        another action in between.&lt;br&gt;
        • The character only moves once.&lt;br&gt;
        • Characters cannot also use extra action Charms or
        Combos containing those Charms when taking more
        than one independent action.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition, if the character chooses to use this
        ability in a given turn, she cannot take any non-reflexive
        dice actions depending on Social or Mental Attributes.
        (This final limit is not intrinsic to fully independent
        actions, but a feature of this Form.) The character does
        not have to use this ability in a given turn if she would
        prefer to use an extra action Charm, use a Combo or take
        a Social or Mental action.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters using the Charcoal March of Spiders
        Form automatically receive the benefits of the Unnatural
        Many-Step Stride and Dance of the Hungry Spider in
        every turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot use more than one Martial Arts
        Form-type Charm at a time.

        The Elder Sutra of Consumption: The maiden became
        a mother...&lt;br&gt;
        Just as the widow spider devours her mate to feed a
        thousand children, the character consumes the force of
        one blow to give rise to a wind of vengeance. She may use
        this Charm immediately after someone successfully attacks
        her. The swirling pattern of her hands forms a raw
        vortex to draw in and disrupt the Essence and physical
        substance of the attack. She immediately inflicts her
        Dexterity + Martial Arts in dice of unblockable,
        undodgeable lethal damage against an unarmed attacker
        or shatters any mortal weapon used against her. If this kills
        an unarmed attacker or destroys an armed attacker's
        weapon, she takes no damage from the attack. Her opponent
        can use a perfect block or a perfect dodge to avoid the
        vortex damage - however, this requires aborting the
        original attack, and again, the Sidereal takes no damage.
        Either way, from the heart of the vortex, the Exalt may
        issue a number of unarmed counterattacks equal to her
        Martial Arts score, doubling their raw damage. She can
        use this Charm in response to a counterattack Charm
        such as Crimson Palm Counterstrike but does not receive
        counterattacks against any counterattack Charm.

        And to one child she said, &amp;quot;I have many things to
        show you.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
        In the jungles of the East, one sometimes finds nests
        of thumbnail spiders: thousands or millions of tiny spiders
        sharing a funnel-shaped web. They normally wait
        for prey to fall into their home but are more than happy
        to swarm over anyone or anything that arouses their ire
        When something destroys their web, such spiders migrate
        for miles, devouring everything they pass, until
        they decide upon a new home. A character using this
        Charm is every bit as destructive. He moves up to (his
        Essence x 10) yards and makes three Martial Arts attacks
        at his full dice pool. Every opponent within five yards of
        his path suffers the effects of each attack. Each dodges or
        blocks individually. If the targets have defensive effects
        that hurt attackers - such as counterattacks, spines or
        an angry invocation of the Shield of Mars - the character
        is immune to the effect. The blur of his passing fist or
        foot fades away into nothingness as the counterattack
        triggers, for the death of a single spider does not hurt the
        swarm. The Exalt's attacks affect both material and
        spiritual targets with equal facility, and the character can
        launch these attacks while dematerialized.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters using Thumbnail Spider March do not
        receive offensive benefits from reflexive movement
        Charms such as the Dance of the Hungry Spider, although
        they can still receive defensive benefits.

        And to another, she said, &amp;quot;You may rest within my
        home, and eat; no need to fly.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
        In the South, surrounded by the sands, there
        stands the great idol Ma-Un-Enle, and there are spi-
        ders that come before it. Sometimes, a spider hears
        Ma-Un-Enle speak a name, and it bows with all its legs,
        and it walks out into the wind. It buries itself under the
        sands, growing ever larger with age, for hundreds or
        thousands of years. Then, when the person whose
        name it has heard comes within 10 miles, it strikes in
        one smooth bound. A character using this Charm can
        spring at any visible target, issuing an unarmed attack
        at the completion of that leap.&lt;br&gt;
        Against a person, this attack does normal damage,
        adding the character's Essence in automatic successes to
        the damage roll. In addition, the target's player must

        against a difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence; on
        failure, the force of the attack reduces the point of impact
        (such as the target's head or chest) to a cloud of blood and
        dust. The target has one turn left to live, or rather, one
        turn before her Essence realizes that she should be dead.
        No mortal medicine can help. The application of a
        magical effect that heals one or more health levels makes
        her Incapacitated but stable, but with one less dot of
        permanent Stamina.&lt;br&gt;
        Treat attacks against inanimate objects as feats of
        strength used to break them; the character's total on the
        Feats of Strength table (see Exalted, p. 252) is (her
        Essence x 5). This does mean a minimum total of 30 —
        the character automatically shatters cliff faces, but a
        powerful Manse might only lose its gate.

        And to a third, she said, &amp;quot;How beautiful you are.&amp;quot;
        In the oceans of the West live green hunting spiders,
        bulbous and hand-sized, scurrying along the underside of
        the surface as easily as if were a web. They kill fish -
        sometimes, even great sharks or whales — for their meat,
        paralyzing them with a pinprick bite and burrowing into
        their flesh, floating to the surface years later, sated, when
        they have eaten it all. A character with this Charm
        possesses a touch every bit as deadly. With one swift
        blow, she can render an enemy helpless and begin to
        devour him for his Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        To use this Charm, she makes a normal unarmed
        attack. If she succeeds and does even one health level of
        damage, she also paralyzes the Essence of her opponent.
        Paralysis means that the target cannot spend motes,
        cannot regain Willpower or Essence and receives the
        benefits of the Heartless Maiden Trance (see p. 133). He
        can overcome this effect for one turn by spending a
        Willpower point and having his player succeed at a
        reflexive Stamina + Occult roll against a difficulty equal
        to the character's Essence. He must do this successfully
        a number of times equal to the character's Martial Arts
        score to completely free himself from the effects. Mean-
        while, until the victim is completely free, the martial
        artist can spend his motes of Essence as if they were her
        own. This can invoke the target's anima banner but does
        not increase the Sidereal's.&lt;br&gt;
        When a character uses this Charm on a consenting
        subject, allowing her to draw on that subject's Essence,
        it is known instead as Seven-Leg Walking.

        And as each heard her words and came to the center of
        her web,&lt;br&gt;
        The master of this Charm learns the eight secret
        atemi practiced by the firstmade of the pattern spiders,
        Asna, who dwells surrounded by her teeming young in
        a sanctum web larger than the Realm. With a success-
        ful unarmed attack, the character can change her
        target, reweaving the structure of the target's exist-
        ence from the Essence outward. This causes one of the
        following effects:&lt;br&gt;
        • Transforms the target into a beast, stripping him
        of his mind and shape.&lt;br&gt;
        • Transforms the target's flesh into one of the five
        elements: a gust of wind, a gout of fire that fades into ash,
        a statue, a watery haze or a living oak. The target is still
        alive, but unless he is an elemental of the relevant type,
        he can take no actions.&lt;br&gt;
        • Grants the target a new life and identity. This uses
        the same rules as the Ceasing to Exist Approach (see p.
        173), save that the effects are permanent and the target
        forgets his original identity.&lt;br&gt;
        • Unmakes the target utterly. In the unlikely
        event a Primordial fails to use a perfect defense, that
        Primordial becomes a Malfean. Any other target instantly
        ceases to exist, in life and in afterlife, as the
        strands of his Essence come violently apart and scatter
        to the corners of Creation.&lt;br&gt;
        This replaces the normal damage of the attack.
        The reapplication of this Charm, extremely po-
        tent benedictions such as the Endowment spirit Charm
        (see the Exalted Storyteller's Companion, p. 53) and
        specific transformative agents such as the Wondrous
        Lunar Transformation (see Exalted: The Lunars, p.
        130) can return transformed targets to normalcy.
        Gathering the pieces of elementally transformed tar-
        gets before returning them to normalcy is advisable.
        Normally, these methods provide an immediate resto-
        ration. However, targets transformed into other people
        and back may have difficulty relinquishing their new
        memories and recovering the old ones. Nothing can
        remake the unmade.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not affect tattooed Lunar Exalted,
        whose bodies reject external transformation. This ap-
        plies even to the final version of the Charm.

        she ate them.&lt;br&gt;
        To master this style is to approach the grandeur of
        Asna Firstborn herself. When the character strikes, she
        does not seem to move so much as to divide into many
        warriors at once. She may cast forth endless invisible
        filaments of web, as with Rain of Unseen Threads, or
        simply strike so quickly as to occupy many locations
        simultaneously. In either case, fighting her does not
        resemble opposing the master herself so much as chal-
        lenging an army of her young: The attacks rain down
        from every side, skittering inward in the unsettling
        many-stepped strides of the form to surround and
        bewilder her foes.&lt;br&gt;
        The character applies each unarmed Martial Arts
        attack she makes this turn against all visible opponents,
        twice each, regardless of distance. Grandmother Spider
        Mastery, as a simple Charm that cannot be in a Combo,
        gives no benefit to characters without access to fully
        independent actions. (That is, characters not using
        Charcoal March of Spiders Form.)

        The character infuses her fingernails with Essence,
        hardening them, sharpening them, lengthening them
        into weapons — and, most importantly, causing them to
        bend, influence and predict the path of fate in the
        manner of starmetal. They inflict Strength + 7L damage,
        with +2 to Speed, Accuracy and Defense, and can parry
        both lethal and ranged attacks. Treat attacks and parries
        enhanced with this Charm as unarmed; they are legal
        weapons for any martial arts style.

        The character wraps her body in a sheath of Essence,
        mirroring in its interaction with her own anima
        the link between Solar Exalted and orichalcum. She
        adds (12L/12B) to her soak. This bonus acts as armor in
        all respects save one: It does not interfere with the use of
        any Martial Arts Charm. Thus, attacks that ignore
        armor ignore this soak, while aggravated damage does
        not. The character can invoke this Charm on her initiative.
        She can also invoke it when attacked but must
        declare the use of the Charm before her opponent's
        player makes his attack roll.

        cannot precisely determine the Sidereal's location:
        He can make an unarmed Martial Arts attack against
        anyone within (his Essence x 5) yards, and the target
        subtracts his Martial Arts from her dice pools to
        defend against him.

        The character binds the substance of Creation to her
        Essence, shifting into a pattern of attacks that radiates
        the elemental authority of jade. Each gives a gift, which
        applies only to unarmed Martial Arts attacks. Her blows
        can be bashing or lethal, as she chooses, reflecting the
        compassion and conviction of green jade. The grace of
        black jade steers her attacks well: She supplements attack
        rolls with one extra automatic success for every three dice
        rolled, rounded up. The reliability of white jade ensures
        reasonable damage: She supplements damage rolls with
        one extra automatic success for every three dice rolled,
        again rounding up. The force of blue jade knocks opponents
        back one yard for each level of damage inflicted.
        Finally, the swiftness of red jade adds + 3 to her initiative.

        and HOU TUI&lt;br&gt;
        The character attunes herself to the Essence of the
        world, drawing on the flows of interwoven fates, raw
        power, progressive change and elemental stability that
        play out all around her. In this fashion, while she main-
        tains the Form, she becomes a living artifact. This Form
        does not mimic the Essence of soulsteel.&lt;br&gt;
        When using this Form, the character continuously
        receives the benefits of the four stances from which it
        derives. In addition, she becomes unbreakable: She
        automatically converts any lethal damage she receives to
        bashing damage, before soak, unless the attack could
        damage one of the Five Magical Materials.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot normally use more than one

        &lt;br&gt;
        and AN and CAl and LI and HUA JI&lt;br&gt;
        The character learns to catch, tangle and throw the
        Essence flows of Charms as if they were the flailing limbs
        of her hapless foes. This is a Martial Arts parry action.
        Therefore, before the character's initiative, she can
        abort to the Charm Redirection Technique. Afterward,
        she can use Martial Arts parry actions (obtained through
        a pre-split dice pool or a Combo with a Charm allowing
        a reflexive Martial Arts parry) for the Charm Redirection
        Technique.&lt;br&gt;
        When someone uses a Charm against her or when
        someone within three yards uses a Charm, the Sidereal's
        player rolls her character's Dexterity + Martial Arts
        against a difficulty equal to the Charm user's Essence.
        The character must invoke the Charm Redirection Tech-
        nique before her opponent's player rolls the Charm's
        effect, if applicable.&lt;br&gt;
        Should the Charm Redirection Technique succeed,
        the Sidereal learns a one-sentence summary of the chosen
        Charm's effects. She can then choose a new target for
        the Charm (if possible) or annul it entirely. The rules for
        annulling Charms are as follows:&lt;br&gt;
        • The target must have the option to not use the
        Charm. (Charms that invoke themselves, such as Surprise
        Anticipation Method, are immune.)&lt;br&gt;
        • The target pays for the Charm normally, but
        nothing happens. For simple or extra action Charms,
        this also means the target cannot act that turn. For
        supplemental Charms, he must take the original dice
        action, unassisted by the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        • Annulling a reflexive Charm allows the target to
        immediately reuse it. For example, if the character annuls
        Seven Shadow Evasion, the target can reinvoke it
        before the relevant attack resolves.&lt;br&gt;
        The key rules for redirecting Charms are as follows:&lt;br&gt;
        • A redirection is only valid if the original user could
        apply the Charm to the new target. For example, the
        Sidereal can redirect a Solar's Sandstorm- Wind Attack
        against any target within (10 x the Solar's Essence) yards
        of the Solar. The redirection must also make sense. A
        Solar's impassioned words can accidentally seduce the
        wrong target, but Eye-Deceiving Camouflage cannot
        accidentally hide the wrong person.&lt;br&gt;
        • Redirecting the Charm does not change the
        variable effects. Base these on the original user's Traits
        and mote expenditure. For example, a redirected Blazing
        Solar Bolt uses the Solar's Dexterity + Melee pool, not
        the Sidereal's.&lt;br&gt;
        • The victim whose Charm the Sidereal redirected
        pays for the Charm normally. For simple Charms, the
        Charm also represents his action for the turn.&lt;br&gt;
        • Redirecting a supplemental Charm also redirects
        the associated dice action. This uses the original user's
        dice pool.&lt;br&gt;
        • Reflexive Charms cannot be redirected&lt;br&gt;
        • Redirecting extra action Charms redirects all
        possible associated dice actions to the new target. If the
        extra action Charm does not allow the application of
        every roll to a single target — the Arrow Storm Technique
        being an example — the character chooses as
        many actions to redirect as possible, and any remaining
        actions proceed normally.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not work against Charms established
        in previous turns or against Combos. It does not
        work against Martial Arts Form-type Charms or sorcery-they
        cannot be redirected or annulled.

        Prerequisite Charms: Charm Redirection Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm extends the Charm Redirection Technique,
        allowing the character to:
        • Annul the effects of established Charms. For
        example, she can cancel an ongoing Flow Like
        Blood Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        • Annul or redirect a Combo. This follows simple
        rules: If the Exalt can legally redirect all the simple,
        supplemental and extra action Charms in a Combo, she
        can do so, as a single invocation of Sequential Charm
        Disruption. If she can legally annul all of them, she can
        do so, again with a single invocation. She chooses
        whether to annul or ignore the reflexive Charms in a
        Combo individually, as they are used.
        To use Sequential Charm Disruption, the character
        must be a target of the Charm or effect or the character
        must come within three yards of the Charm's original
        user. She then uses a Martial Arts parry action against
        the Charm itself, her player rolling Dexterity + Martial
        Arts against the Charm user's Essence. When disrupting
        Combos, if applicable, the Sidereal must invoke Sequential
        Charm Disruption before her opponent begins rolling
        the Charms' effects.&lt;br&gt;
        Like Charm Redirection Technique, this Charm
        does not affect Form-type Charms or Sorcery. The Es-
        sence cost for this Charm equals the Essence cost for all
        the Charms affected, plus 5 motes.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Swan's Combo, as described on page 215
        of Exalted, includes Striking Serpent Speed, Crippling Pres-
        sure-Point Strike, Serpentine Evasion and Thunderbolt At-
        tack Prana. Nerys wishes to thwart Swan and his associate
        Imri using Sequential Charm Disruption. The Sidereal splits
        her dice pool and attacks him. Swan invokes Serpentine
        Evasion, declaring the Combo and spending 1 Willpower.
        Nerys ignores this Charm, and Swan successfully evades.
        Then, Swan attacks. He spends 4 motes and 1 Willpower on
        Striking Serpent Speed, his player rolling the Eclipse's Essence
        and discovering that he can make three attacks that
        turn. Each attack costs 6 motes and 1 Willpower, for a total
        cost of 22 motes of Essence and 4 Willpower. Nerys uses her
        second action to parry and disrupt the Combo, with a
        difficulty equal to Swan's Essence. This costs 27 motes and
        1 Willpower. She cannot redirect Swan's actions to different
        targets because of the rules for redirecting extra action Charms.
        However, if Imri happens to be standing near Swan, Nerys
        can legally redirect all of these Charms at her. Swan shrinks
        into a tight crouch, then explodes upward in a leap, blazing
        with golden Essence. Nerys catches and twists the power
        radiating from Swan. Instead of enabling a terrifying assault
        against Nerys, the energy flow from Swan's Combo draws
        him, with absolute grace and helpless beauty, into a series of
        three fierce attacks upon Imri. Each blow casts off spherical
        shockwaves of white energy, and not until all three land can
        Swan wrench himself free from the tangled Essence flow.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character uses martial arts to yank the threads
        of a delicate construct of sorcery out of place. Upon
        contact with the effects of sorcery, she activates this
        Charm and makes a reflexive unarmed Martial Arts
        attack against the structure of the spell. The difficulty
        equals the sorcerer's Essence plus the spell's circle. If she
        succeeds, the spell shatters, as if dispelled by countermagic
        of its own circle.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt can work an even greater mischief if
        someone actually casts a spell within her reach. Her
        player makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack roll as
        described above. If she succeeds, the Sidereal can abort
        the spell as above. Alternately, she can cause the entire
        structure to unravel as if the sorcerer had botched a
        distraction roll (see Exalted, pp. 216-217).&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm functions against necromancy as well
        as sorcery, but only if the Sidereal Exalted has had
        extensive opportunity to study the dark magics of the
        Abyssal Exalted.

        The character uses her education in the nature of
        fate in conjunction with her martial skill to disjoint,
        snarl and otherwise tangle the fates the spiders weave.
        By lightly striking the target in the five points where the
        threads of the Loom of Fate attach, the Sidereal can
        negate the effects of Sidereal astrology. Upon contact
        with a Sidereal astrological effect, she may activate this
        Charm and make a reflexive unarmed Martial Arts
        attack against the threads of destiny. The difficulty
        equals the Essence + College of the Sidereal who
        created the effect. If she succeeds, the effect is dangerously
        torn or frayed, and the pattern spiders abandon it.
        This causes • Paradox to both the martial artist attack-
        ing the effect and the Sidereal who created it and may
        trigger an inquiry by the bureau.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm can target resplendent destinies, even
        ones lurking in the target's background. If the target has
        multiple effects active at once, the martial artist will
        have to attack them each separately. Roll first for any
        active resplendent destiny, then any other effects, highest
        Essence + College first.

        The character balances her actions so perfectly to
        the local flow of Essence that the world around her -
        whether Creation, the Wyld, the Underworld or Malfeas
        itself — cannot help but support her victory.&lt;br&gt;
        While using the Soul Fire Shaper Form, the character
        increases her effective permanent Essence score
        to 10. This does not give her additional temporary
        Essence, although it does increase her maximum temporary
        Essence. It does not allow her to purchase
        Charms, familiars or acquaintances she would other-
        wise be unable to possess. Otherwise, treat her Essence
        as 10 for all effects.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition, the character can make one free use of
        Charm Redirection Technique, Sequential Charm Dis-
        ruption, Astrology Interruption Method
        or Spell-Shattering Palm in each turn. This is part of the
        Form's effect and does not count as the character's action
        or Charm for that turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot normally use more than one
        Martial Arts Form-type Charm at a time.

        The character steps into an object or person, displacing
        its natural spirit with his Essence manipulations
        as easily as a master of legerdemain might steal a mortal's
        coat. The Sidereal's player rolls Charisma + Martial Arts
        against a difficulty equal to the Essence of the Exalt's
        target — the body he wants to steal or the god or least god
        of the thing he wishes to possess. The target's player can
        make a simple Willpower roll against difficulty 2 each
        turn to regain control over her body. In the meantime,
        the Exalt's body dematerializes. He can move and take
        Martial Arts actions through the stolen flesh, using the
        body's Strength, Dexterity or Stamina if they exceed his
        own. This Charm imbues the stolen body with supernatural
        flexibility and mobility. Thus, possessed trees
        can attack and unattended ox-carts can charge.&lt;br&gt;
        The character cannot possess soulsteel. He can only
        possess objects made of other Magical Materials if he
        knows the style's Charm for emulating that Magical
        Material (see pp. 189-191).

        The character strikes his throat, abdomen, spine,
        brow and crown chakras, forcibly reshaping his Essence
        and altering how his anima interacts with the world.
        This is actually a set of Charms. Each allows the
        character, for five turns, to mimic the anima banner
        and anima effects of one other type and caste of Exalted.
        Most Sidereals on this path choose No Moon or
        Changing Moon Lunar Ways, Zenith or Night Solar
        Ways or Dragon-Blooded Aspect of Air Ways. However,
        even Alchemical, Abyssal and alternate Sidereal
        castes are viable choices. This Charm temporarily
        replaces the Exalt's anima banner. It does not change
        his Caste Mark or suppress his ability to make his
        Maiden's Lesser Sign. The character also adds his
        Essence in automatic successes to one of the relevant
        caste's favored Attributes or Abilities while this Charm
        operates. He can choose a new Attribute or Ability
        each time he invokes this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Knowing Exalt Ways, even Eclipse Caste Solar
        Ways or Moonshadow Caste Abyssal Ways, gives no
        special ability to purchase normally forbidden Charms.

        &lt;br&gt;
        and WU JI&lt;br&gt;
        The character adopts the attitude and posture of the
        spirit courts, moving with the infinite baroque complexity
        necessary to the management of Creation. Directed
        by the four powers of her mind — aspiration, effort,
        intention and analysis — the whole of her Essence flows
        as one. Simultaneously, even the smallest mote of her
        being directs itself toward managing its own affairs.
        Though no imperfect creature can truly master it,
        this Form has a perfect beauty to it. While the character
        uses this Form, enemies' players must fail a Compassion
        roll if these enemies wish to harm her. Subduing her or
        manipulating her remains acceptable. Enemies cannot
        spend Willpower for the roll to deliberately fail. Those
        who witness the Games of Divinity Form become addicted:
        So long as they remember the Sidereal or the
        Form, they crave to see it again. Their players must
        succeed at Temperance rolls for their characters to refuse
        any reasonable opportunity to behold, once again, the
        Games of Divinity Form.&lt;br&gt;
        Dreamstones (see p. 18) provide a more intense
        experience than this Form. Dreamstone addiction both
        wipes away and prevents addiction to the Form. However,
        witnessing or performing the Games of Divinity
        Form is an unpleasant but palatable dreamstone alternative
        for even the most desperate of addicts.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot normally use more than one
        Martial Arts Form-type Charm at a time.

        Tugging gently on the flows of Essence around him,
        the character forms himself into a nexus, a convergence
        point through which power pours. The Sidereal's player
        rolls Dexterity + Martial Arts, unmodified by any other
        Charms. For the remainder of the scene, each of the
        Exalt's successful unarmed attacks also does aggravated
        damage equal to the number of successes rolled for the
        Demesne Emulation Practice Charm. This damage is
        soaked separately. The Sidereal's hand upon an enemy's
        chest burns her with raw Essence, his elbow in her ear
        fills her head with Essence lightning, and his foot against
        her knee is as terribly cold as the Essence of a saltwater
        siren's heart.

        The character adopts the stately grandeur of a temple
        and radiates the ancient power of a Manse. She can now
        properly channel and constrain the raw Essence flow
        that the Demesne Emulation Practice feeds into her,
        coalescing it around her Caste Mark into a Hearthstone
        set in her brow. This Hearthstone only exists while the
        character is using Demesne and Manse Form. When the
        Sidereal terminates the Form, the Hearthstone fades.&lt;br&gt;
        When using the Form, the character receives the
        Hearthstone's benefits, as if it were properly set in a
        starmetal circlet. The player and the Storyteller should
        work together to determine its effects, developing a 4- or
        5-dot Hearthstone that reflects the character's personal-
        ity. Treat major changes to the character's nature as
        architectural alterations to a Manse, adjusting the
        Hearthstone's abilities appropriately.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Elder Sutra of Essence: The last maiden's name was
        TAO. These were their names, but they knew them not.
        As she assumes this Form, the character vanishes
        into the flows of Essence around her. For a long moment,
        she is nowhere and everywhere, embodied in the dance
        of all things. Then, she manifests again, in every move-
        ment consummately aware of everything around her,
        reacting to intentions before they are formed, actions
        before they are taken and to the battle as a whole as easily
        as to a single blow.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm doubles the character's base initiative
        (Dexterity + Wits). Charms such as Opportune Shot and
        Thunderclap Rush Attack do not automatically win
        initiative over her. The Exalt is aware of every attack
        against her and is immune to sensory penalties — this is
        a perfect effect. She can sense every effect, object and
        creature within (her Essence x 10) yards. Noticing something
        hidden requires a reflexive Perception + Awareness
        roll, adding the Sidereal's Essence in automatic successes.&lt;br&gt;
        While using the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation
        Form, the character can also invoke any or all of its
        subsidiary Forms, paying the normal Essence cost. As
        long as the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form is
        active, the Four Magical Materials Form, Soul Fire Shaper
        Form, Games of Divinity Form and Demesne and Manse
        Form can coexist with it and with one another. The
        character can also invoke other Form-type Charms, but
        this limits her to a total of two other Forms. For example,
        she could invoke Prismatic Arrangement of Creation
        Form followed by either Earth Dragon Form and Games
        of Divinity Form, Tiger Form and Ebon Shadow Form or
        Snake Form and Charcoal March of Spiders Form. The
        Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form is transcendent
        and embraces other Forms as lesser parts of itself.&lt;br&gt;
        While this Form is active, the character may have
        access to unexpected weaponry. Any weapon treated as
        an unarmed attack by a style whose Form-type Charm
        she has active is treated as an unarmed attack for the
        purpose of all Martial Arts Charms. This is a specific
        benefit of the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form
        and not a general rule. For example, Tiger Form allows
        the use of tiger claws as unarmed attacks. If she has both
        Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form and Tiger
        Form active, the Sidereal can use tiger claws to inflict the
        Water Spider Bite - whether or not she also has Char-
        coal March of Spiders Form active. This effect does not
        extend to armor.&lt;br&gt;
        The Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form is
        complete and perfect in every respect, but to perform it
        correctly requires a deep understanding of the other
        styles that it subsumes. Sidereal masters estimate that a
        complete understanding of roughly 40 styles would allow
        an essentially accurate adoption of this Form, possibly
        increasing the power of this Charm.

<h3>Decay: The Citrine Poxes Martial Arts<a class="headerlink" href="#decay-the-citrine-poxes-martial-arts" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Weapons and Armor</em>
Charms in the Citrine Poxes of Contagion Style
treat attacks the Sidereal makes with a staff, seven-section
staff, serpent-sting staff, hammer or goremaul
as unarmed attacks, but only if the character inflicts
bashing damage with them. This usually means accepting
a +1 difficulty penalty and “pulling ones
blows.” The primary purpose of the style’s attacks is
to affect the target’s Essence flows by connecting
with a series of key pressure points. Crushing the
target’s bones lacks the subtlety and precision this
technique requires.
Characters cannot use this style while wearing
armor.</p>

        ...whose lover's practices displeased the sun. The all-
        seeing sun no longer could sustain&lt;br&gt;
        Tormenting the enemy like the bites of a hundred
        mosquitoes, the character delivers a spark of poisoned
        Essence into the core of his enemy's soul. This is an
        infectious Martial Arts attack that carries the White
        Sun Sickness.&lt;br&gt;
        A victim of White Sun Sickness suffers from a fever
        of the soul. Each time she spends motes of Essence on a
        Charm, the disease increases the Charm's cost by l mote.
        This effect is a cumulative one: The second expenditure
        costs 2 extra motes, the third costs three, and so forth.
        Reduce the accumulated total by five in each day the
        victim spends no motes. The victim also hallucinates. In
        stressful situations, this reduces all of her dice pools by
        her own permanent Essence. Without external stressors,
        she may detach entirely from reality. Finally, the victim
        gains Limit at twice the normal rate. This is a coincidental
        interaction with the Great Curse and not a direct
        effect of the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        White Sun Sickness occurs in nature. It afflicts —
        though very rarely — those who spend too long meditating
        on the ways of the Fair Folk, the ever-changing spirit
        of Luna, the power of the Elemental Dragons or the
        inspiring greatness of the Unconquered Sun.&lt;br&gt;

        These practices, but with enraged disdain, darts forth
        such pestilent malignant beams,
        Her fingers brushing past the victim's defenses like
        contaminated water seeping into a pool, the character
        infects a victim's Essence with the spastic, divisive
        Drunken Moth Sickness. This is an infectious Martial
        Arts attack.&lt;br&gt;
        A victim of Drunken Moth Sickness no longer
        entirely controls his behavior. The disease comes with a
        general purpose specified by the Sidereal - something
        like &amp;quot;embarrass yourself,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;protect me&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;beat up your
        friends.&amp;quot; In each turn, the character has three choices:
        Use a simple Charm, use a Combo, or spend at least half
        of his non-reflexive actions serving the disease's purpose.
        (Splitting his dice pool or buying extra actions is recom-
        mended — if he only takes one action, then it goes to the
        illness.) The disease only forces him to take action when
        an obvious way of fulfilling its purpose exists, either
        without using Charms or using Charms already active.
        Otherwise, the actions that go to the Drunken Moth
        Sickness are wasted — the character does nothing.&lt;br&gt;
        This disease occasionally occurs in nature, generally
        when someone eats something into which a spirit has
        been bound.&lt;br&gt;

        As shed infection on air, earth and streams;
        One precise punch or kick disrupts the entire functioning
        of the victim's body and soul, shattering his
        Essence into the jagged pattern characteristic of the
        Jigsaw Organ Condition. This is an infectious Martial
        Arts attack.&lt;br&gt;
        A victim of the Jigsaw Organ Condition lacks the
        physical coherence of his peers. Struck in combat, he
        loses limbs or extremities with abnormal ease, simply
        falling apart. Fortunately, when he does lose a limb, he
        need simply stick it back on, and it begins to heal.
        Similarly, if he loses an organ, he can spend a turn
        swallowing it, and it slides back into place. Individual
        organs remain alive, connected and under the victim's
        control when separated from the body. The victim still
        takes damage normally, however, due to the sheer physical
        trauma of it. Whenever a victim suffers damage, roll
        his Stamina against a difficulty equal to the number of
        health levels lost. On a failure, a limb falls off, he coughs
        out a lung, or some similar event transpires.&lt;br&gt;
        If the Sidereal successfully infects someone with
        this disease, the target automatically loses a limb or
        organ of the Sidereal's choice. The Exalt can attempt
        to catch it with a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics action
        at her full dice pool. For example, she might infect her
        victim with a measured blow to the back, cartwheeling
        past him to catch his heart as he coughs it into her
        hands. She can again force a lost limb of her choice and,
        again, try to catch it, any time she does damage to the
        afflicted target - the target cannot defend himself
        with a Stamina roll.&lt;br&gt;
        Defensive Charms only protect such organs or
        limbs as they are naturally applicable to. By default,
        limited leverage reduces the dice pool for a severed
        limb's actions to 0 before the influence of Charms.
        Further, most Charms simply do not function when
        employed by a severed organ. However, appropriate
        stunts or the help of a friend can give a victim's limb
        access to his full dice pool.&lt;br&gt;
        The Sidereal Exalted are only aware of 40 naturally
        contracted cases of Jigsaw Organ Condition this Age.&lt;br&gt;
        The vector for this disease is unknown.&lt;br&gt;

        From whence this malady its birth received.&lt;br&gt;
        The character's understanding of the art of infectious
        martial arts increases. She learns the 25 underlying
        principles of infection and may apply them in combination
        to inflict arbitrary First or Second Circle illnesses
        upon her opponent. This requires an infectious Martial
        Arts attack supplemented by this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters develop their own First or Second Circle
        infections for use with Essence-Disrupting Infectious
        Atemi. Creating such a sickness requires an Intelligence
        + Medicine roll. The player describes the disease desired,
        and the Storyteller decides upon its Circle and treatment
        difficulties. The difficulty of the Medicine roll equals the
        Magical Treatment Difficulty for the sickness. Reduce
        this difficulty by one point if another Sidereal Exalted
        teaches the character how to inflict the disease. The
        Sidereal can attempt to realize a general infection concept,
        her player making the appropriate roll, no more
        than once per story.&lt;br&gt;
        Normally, characters practice the infliction of new
        spiritual infections before testing them in battle. Developing
        diseases on the fly imposes a +2 difficulty penalty.
        It also requires the Storyteller's permission and requires
        a separate action from the blow that inflicts the disease.

        ...On him the dreadful lot did fall, who now was placed
        before the altar bound,&lt;br&gt;
        With precise blows, the character batters the target
        into the perfect shape written into the core of the target's
        Essence. Violent as the Exalt's attacks may be, they do no
        damage. The target's bones and flesh, when struck, slide
        perfectly into their most appropriate place. The Sidereal's
        player rolls Dexterity + Martial Arts against a difficulty
        equal to the target's Essence. Add the character's Medicine
        score in automatic successes. The target can dodge
        or parry normally. If the Sidereal hits, the target experiences
        the following beneficial effects:&lt;br&gt;
        • The target heals all bashing damage.&lt;br&gt;
        • The target heals a number of lethal damage levels
        equal to the character's Martial Arts score. Treat any
        aggravated damage levels as two lethal damage levels,
        and heal them first.&lt;br&gt;
        • The target can immediately spend one experience
        point to heal one point of permanent Trait loss. This
        cannot raise a Trait above the highest level previously
        purchased. (In other words, the target cannot lose a
        point of Willpower, buy it back between stories and then
        take advantage of this Charm to raise it further.)&lt;br&gt;
        • Any effect that has locked the target into an
        undesired shape is instantly shattered.&lt;br&gt;
        After a successful application of this method, the
        target's player must succeed at a Temperance roll against
        difficulty 2, or the target falls unconscious in a moment
        of transcendent ecstasy.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can use this method on herself. This
        Charm does not affect tattooed Lunar Exalted, who treat
        it as an external attempt to modify their shape (see
        Exalted: the Lunars, p. 121).

        His head with sacrificial garlands crowned,
        Like the rain that comes after a battle to wash away
        the blood and tears, the gentle fall of the Sidereal's hands
        or feet upon a target's Essence cleanses the target of
        disease and ill effects. The Sidereal's player rolls Dexter-
        ity + Martial Arts against a difficulty equal to the target's
        Essence. Add the character's Medicine score in auto-
        matic successes. The target can dodge or parry normally.
        If the character hits, the target experiences the following
        beneficial effects:&lt;br&gt;
        • Spiritual and physical diseases instantly leave
        her system, and she fully recovers from their effects.
        The Exalt's player must roll Intelligence + Medicine
        against the Magical Treatment Difficulty to cure a
        Third Circle illness or the Great Contagion (difficulty
        5) with this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        • All poison and drugs leave her system, and
        addictions are broken.&lt;br&gt;
        • Any Possession Charm affecting the target is
        broken, and all lingering effects disappear.&lt;br&gt;
        • The Sidereal Exalted can transfer as many motes
        of his Essence to the target as desired.&lt;br&gt;
        • The Sidereal Exalted can transfer as many points
        of his temporary Willpower to the target as desired.&lt;br&gt;
        • Curses upon the target are broken, although
        permanently lost Attributes are not recovered. This
        includes most debilitating effects imposed through non-physical
        means.&lt;br&gt;
        • The character can erase painful memories,
        that he is aware of, which afflict the target. In the
        future, the target must spend a Willpower point to
        recall these memories for a scene, and even then, they
        return only dimly.&lt;br&gt;
        The target has even greater difficulty remembering
        the events leading up to the use of this Charm -
        specifically, the scene in which this Charm was used.
        Remembering those events later requires not simply a
        Willpower point, but a successful Conviction roll against
        difficulty 2. Again, the memory only lasts for a scene.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can use this method on herself.

        of redress, four fundamental patterns of Essence
        flow designed to overcome restraints upon the heart,
        body, mind and soul. This instantly breaks any debilitating
        magical effects upon her, save for those imposed by
        the limits of her own Charms. In addition, for the
        remainder of the turn, the players of others must succeed
        at an Essence roll with a difficulty equal to the character's
        permanent Essence for their characters to affect the
        Sidereal with a Charm, spell or Charm-assisted attack.
        The Exalt can invoke this Charm reflexively to impede
        a magical attack against her.

        remainder of the scene, she adds her temporary Essence to
        her bashing and lethal soak. However, she must burn

        ...From him the malady received its name.&lt;br&gt;
        The character moves in a sinuous pattern that
        makes the flows of Essence about her weep. An anima
        banner-like effect rises above her, displaying a lattice-
        work of iron dripping with sea water and blood. This is
        the symbol of the sickness named Iphimedeia, the Revel
        Outside the Sealing of the Gates. The air out to (her
        Essence x 10) yards from the character becomes redolent
        with contagion. Starting the next turn, all those within
        that distance of the Exalt risk infection. The Exalt can
        protect a number of allies up to her permanent Essence
        from this effect. This is an infectious Martial Arts attack.
        It does not require that the character strike her targets,
        but perfect blocks and perfect dodges still protect against
        the outpouring of disease.&lt;br&gt;
        A victim of Iphimedeia finds the flesh of his body
        twisting and flowing, melting while remaining yet alive.
        This does one level of unsoakable aggravated damage per
        turn but stops when aggravated damage fills the -0 and -
        I wound tracks. Characters protected against the
        influence of the Wyld do not suffer from this effect.&lt;br&gt;
        The infected also find their legs twitching with the
        desire to dance. In any given turn, a victim can choose
        to succumb, devoting a dice action to dancing, adding
        his Essence in automatic successes to the Performance
        roll and losing control over his movement. He normally
        dances around an object or person chosen by the Story-
        teller at a distance of 10 yards. Alternately, he can resist.
        Struggling with his own body reduces his effective
        Dexterity to O.&lt;br&gt;
        The greater a victim's self-control, the more
        Iphimedeia impedes him. In each turn, he must fail a
        Temperance roll, spend a Willpower point or lose his
        action as patches of the air become as hard as iron to him.
        Choosing to dance does not protect him from this effect.
        If appropriate to the game style, female Dragon-Blooded
        Aspects of Water may find themselves pregnant after
        catching and recovering from Iphimedeia. If so, the child
        always Exalts.&lt;br&gt;
        The Revel Outside the Sealing of the Gates is a
        Third Circle illness. Characters whose players roll
        against the Sidereal's Essence to resist lose all dice
        from their Stamina + Resistance pool before the
        application of Charms..&lt;br&gt;

        The character's understanding of the processes by
        which one balances or unbalances the flow of a person's
        Essence helps him shield himself from any disability.
        For a single mote of Essence, he can render himself
        permanently immune to any poison or disease to which
        he has been exposed. He can also spend a mote of
        Essence to halve the damage from a single attack, after
        damage is rolled, or to reflexively protect himself from
        any disabling effect upon his body or mind. He must
        invoke the Charm once for each such attack or effect.
        For example, hit by a Lightning Torment Hatchet, the
        Sidereal could spend 1 mote to halve the damage taken
        and 1 mote to block its painful, disabling effect. The
        character cannot cure disabilities originating outside
        his body, such as shackles binding his wrists. All of
        these effects are perfect. The character is the master of

        ways. Applying them in combination, she can wreak the
        greatest forms of havoc upon the Essence flows of her
        enemies. The character can use this Charm as an infectious
        Martial Arts attack to contaminate others with
        arbitrary Third Circle illnesses.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters develop their own Third Circle illnesses
        for use with Gentle Touch of the Wicked Hand.
        Infection follows the ordinary rules for infectious Martial
        Arts, save that it is intrinsically more difficult — as
        noted above — to resist Third Circle infection. Creating
        a Third Circle illness requires an Intelligence +
        Medicine roll. The Storyteller sets a difficulty between
        5 and 10, based on the disease's effects. Reduce this
        difficulty by one point if another Sidereal teaches the
        character how to inflict this disease. The Sidereal can
        attempt to realize a general infection concept, her
        player making the appropriate roll, no more than once
        in every year.&lt;br&gt;
        Normally, characters practice the infliction of
        new spiritual infections before testing them in battle.
        Developing diseases on the fly imposes a +2 difficulty
        penalty. It also requires the Storyteller's permission
        and requires a separate action from the blow that
        inflicts the disease.

        what is whole&lt;br&gt;
        The character learns to guard himself and others
        from even the most terrible attacks. This Charm
        manipulates one target's Essence. Under its effects,
        she automatically converts any aggravated damage
        she receives to lethal damage, before soak. This
        stacks with Charms that convert lethal to bashing
        damage; characters under both effects convert all
        damage directly to bashing. The character can use
        this Charm on himself.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One turn&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Martial Arts: 7&lt;br&gt;

        The character's fists blur as she pounds them
        against the air, shattering the currents of the world
        and casting a storm of broken and tainted Essence
        toward her foes. In the first turn, the effects extend
        three yards beyond her fists. Anyone and anything
        immediately in front of her suffers either 15 dice of
        aggravated damage or a Third Circle illness she has
        learned to inflict (targets can resist the disease
        normally.) This is an unblockable, undodgeable
        effect. For each turn that the Exalt continuously
        performs this Charm, the effects stretch one mile
        further forward and a tenth of a mile further to each
        side. This Charm is a semi-physical effect, and does
        not reach through unbroken walls, earth, trees, etc.
        until the turn it either destroys them or has a route
        around them. It does not extend behind the character
        or to her sides.
