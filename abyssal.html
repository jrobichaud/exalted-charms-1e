        Bloodthirsty Arrow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per die&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 2&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character extends a wisp of Oblivion through his
        bow, filling his arrow with a thirst for blood and death. The
        shaft eagerly adjusts its course to compensate for any
        evasive action. For every mote of Essence the Abyssal
        spends, he may either reduce the dice pool of his target’s
        first defensive action by one die or add one die to the
        damage of an attack against a living target. This Charm
        cannot reduce a character’s dice pool lower than her
        Essence score, nor can it add more damage than the
        activating Abyssal’s permanent Essence. The Exalt can
        use both effects of this Charm at the same time, provided
        he can afford the Essence expenditure.

        Twisting Spiteful Shaft&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 3 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Bloodthirsty Arrow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Empowered with rage and seething Essence, the
        Abyssal’s arrow twists cruelly within its target to inflict
        horrible rending wounds. Even after impact, it continues
        to bore deeper into the flesh until forcibly removed.
        Arrows enchanted with this Charm add the character’s
        permanent Essence to their base damage. In addition, if
        the arrow inflicts damage, the head continues boring into
        the target, inflicting its normal damage modifier at the
        beginning of each subsequent turn until pulled free, for a
        maximum number of turns equal to the firing character’s
        permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        This damage cannot be lower than one die. Thus, a
        standard broadhead arrow inflicts 2L each turn, a frog
        crotch 4L and a target arrow 1L. Damage inflicted by a
        boring arrow can only be soaked with Stamina and other
        natural soak. Removing an arrow requires a successful
        Strength + Athletics roll against a difficulty equal to the
        permanent Essence of the firing character. This difficulty
        can never rise above 5. Once a victim dies or the arrow has
        been pulled free, its magic immediately fades. Only arrows
        that naturally inflict lethal damage can be enchanted with
        this Charm.

        Hundred Paces Bite&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Twisting Spiteful Shaft&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal’s arrow becomes a
        conduit for his life-draining anima. The Exalt regains one
        mote of Essence for every health level of damage his arrow
        inflicts on a living target. If this Charm is placed in a
        Combo with Twisting Spiteful Shaft, the Essence cost
        increases to 3 motes, but the arrow continues to absorb
        Essence as long as it burrows.
        &quot;

        Pulse of the Prey&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 3 motes + special&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 4&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Bloodthirsty Arrow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character’s eyes glint with power as he attunes his
        gaze to the glow of Essence in his victim. For 3 motes, the
        Exalt may make a single Archery attack without penalty
        for visual conditions, although other environmental fac-
        tors may interfere with his accuracy. For every additional
        mote spent, the character may also add one die to his
        Archery attack roll, although he cannot add more dice
        than his target’s Essence score. This Charm does not aid in
        targeting inanimate objects.
        &quot;

        Flawless Archer Discipline&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 2 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 5&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Pulse of the Prey&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Guided by the grim certainty of death, the Abyssal
        blocks out all distractions. From the time he draws his
        arrow to the moment of release, the deathknight perceives
        and knows nothing but his target and his cold desire to end
        its existence. The player still rolls an attack as normal, but
        successes only matter for purposes of damage. Even in the
        case of a botch, he still hits the target, inflicting the arrow’s
        base damage. Although this Charm permits feats of impossible
        accuracy, such as cutting ropes or picking off objects
        at the maximum range of the bow, it does not allow called
        shots to bypass armor.
        &quot;

        Prerequisite Charms: Flawless Archer Discipline&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Her arms and fingers a flickering blur of motion, an
        Abyssal with this Charm may empty her entire quiver
        before her opponents have time to register surprise. So
        long as the character hits her intended target, she may
        make another attack at her full Archery dice pool. The
        character must concentrate all her attacks on one target.
        This Charm ends when the character exhausts her ammunition
        or when she has done damage a number of times
        equal to her Archery score.
        &quot;

    iron_sleet_attack[Iron Sleet Attack]
    click iron_sleet_attack callback &quot;
        Iron Sleet Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 4 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Infused with the chill of the Void, the character’s
        arrow freezes in flight and trails wisps of glowing frost. This
        supernatural cold adds the character’s Essence score to the
        arrow’s damage, as well as inflicting debilitating frostbite.
        Victims of Iron Sleet Attack lose one dot of Dexterity
        every time the Iron Sleet Attack successfully does damage
        to them. Characters reduced to zero Dexterity can only
        huddle in misery, assuming they can move at all. Frostbitten
        characters regain lost Dexterity at the rate of one dot
        per hour. This Charm has no effect on the undead or on
        other beings immune to extreme cold.
        &quot;

        Relic Arrow Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per arrow&lt;br&gt;

        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Iron Sleet Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character draws his bow, and a savagely barbed
        shaft materializes under his touch. Arrows created with
        this Charm have normal statistics for their type of ammunition
        but shimmer like spun glass and evaporate moments
        after impact.
        &quot;

    splinter_of_the_void[Splinter of the Void]
    relic_arrow_method --&gt; splinter_of_the_void
    click splinter_of_the_void callback &quot;
        Splinter of the Void&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per 2L&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 4&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Relic Arrow Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Abyssal draws a bolt of crackling Oblivion across
        his bow. This bolt is fired as a normal arrow, but inflicts a
        base damage of 2L for every mote of Essence spent. The
        character’s bow does not add to this total. Against Fair
        Folk, mutants and other creatures of the Wyld, the necrotic
        energy inflicts aggravated damage. Characters killed
        by this Charm disintegrate in a shrieking flash of barrow-
        flame and leave no ghosts. Oblivion bolts do not suffer
        penalties for distance or wind, and have a maximum range
        of (the archer’s permanent Essence x 100) yards. Characters
        cannot spend more Essence powering this Charm than
        their Archery score. Splinter of the Void is incompatible
        with arrow-enhancing Charms.

        Exquisite Relic Bow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 4&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Relic Arrow Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Sculpting his anima with a thought, the Abyssal
        summons a bow of calcified Essence and memory into her
        hands. This bow has an Accuracy equal to the character’s
        Essence but otherwise has the same statistics as a composite
        bow fitted to its creator’s Strength. Despite their
        common Traits, each Abyssal’s bow is a unique expression
        of her soul — no two are exactly alike. Exquisite Relic Bow
        does not manifest with ammunition, so characters without
        arrows must employ Relic Arrow Method.

        Piercing Ghost Barb&lt;br&gt;

        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 5&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Pulse of the Prey, Splinter of the Void&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        As with Relic Arrow Method, the Exalt summons a
        shaft of pure Essence. This translucent arrow glows softly
        and moans as it flies. The shaft is fired like a normal arrow,
        but dematerializes as it leaves the bow. The arrow remains
        visible but incorporeal, capable of passing through solid
        matter without a trace. The arrow only rematerializes if it
        intersects a living being in its path. Since the bolt bypasses
        walls and armor, victims can only soak the attack with
        their Stamina and other natural soak. Trees and other
        living barriers provide cover normally, as does armor that
        is somehow alive, such as a perronele (see Games of
        Divinity, p. 119-120). This Charm also allows the character
        to hit dematerialized spirits, although it does not kill
        them permanently. Any incorporeal spirit struck by a
        Piercing Ghost Barb manifests to all onlookers for the rest
        of the scene as a luminous but intangible apparition.

        Prerequisite: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Exalted focuses the Essence of the Underworld
        into his hands. Any attacks the character makes without
        a weapon that turn cause lethal rather than bashing
        damage. However, this Charm only works against bare or
        cloth-covered flesh. Characters in metal armor are im-
        mune to this Charm. Abyssals who use this Charm often
        Combo it with the Rust Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Abyssal seizes his opponent and crushes her with
        the unnatural strength of the risen dead. The character
        makes a clinch attack as normal (see Exalted p. 239), but
        he inflicts lethal damage with his initial grab. So long as
        the Exalt continues to reflexively activate the Charm at
        the beginning of the turn, his clinch inflicts lethal damage
        rather than bashing. In addition, the deathknight’s damage
        pool increases by +1L for every full turn the Charm is
        maintained. This bonus is cumulative over successive
        turns, but resets to zero if the Abyssal stops spending
        Essence or relaxes his grip for even a moment.

        Fueling his hunger with Essence, an Abyssal with this
        Charm can drain blood far more quickly. The Exalt can
        drink up to his Essence x 3 health levels in a turn, rather
        than the usual one. Blood loss afflicts the target normally.
        This Charm does not accelerate the rate at which the
        Abyssal can devour flesh.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal can grab a victim and
        choke him to death without making a sound. The player
        rolls for a standard hold attempt (see Exalted, p. 240),
        adding her character’s Essence score in automatic successes
        to the initial roll to grab. As usual, this attack inflicts
        no damage. If the Exalt succeeds, she tightly — and silently
        — seizes her victim by the throat. He cannot breathe at all,
        either to inhale or to scream a warning, although he may
        still try to escape on his next action. However, the victim
        cumulatively loses one die from his Strength + Brawl/
        Martial Arts dice pool for every successive turn the hold is
        maintained. Once a victim has no dice remaining, he can
        no longer struggle. Incapacitated characters caught in an
        Inescapable Iron Grip suffocate as though drowning (see
        Exalted, p. 243). Players of victims may roll Stamina +
        Resistance against a difficulty of the Abyssal’s permanent
        Essence to hold their breath longer. Victims begin breathing
        immediately if released before death.

        The character surges forward in a burst of speed,
        allowing him to grab and pin an enemy before she can
        respond. The Exalt makes a normal clinch or hold attack,
        but his target cannot parry or dodge. Clinches enhanced by
        this Charm do no damage, but in the case of both clinches
        and holds, the characters immediately have a reflexive
        contest to maintain the clinch or hold as though it was a
        subsequent round. If the defender wins, she retains her
        action for the round, but the actual clinch attack cannot
        be parried or dodged. As an added benefit, the character
        may move up to his normal sprinting distance without
        penalty on the turn he uses this Charm, to allow the
        character to clinch opponents ordinarily beyond his reach.
        The character need not make this extended action.

        The Abyssal concentrates his anima into a roiling

        but its withering aura of entropy reduces the target’s
        soak by 1 point for every mote spent, or 2 points per
        mote in the case of inanimate objects. This reduction
        only applies for resisting the character’s one attack.
        Animate targets cannot have their soak reduced below
        their permanent Essence.

        With this Charm, the character envelops her hand in
        a cyclone of howling shadows. With a normal strike or
        even a gentle touch, the Abyssal blasts her opponent back
        two yards for every mote spent. If the victim strikes a solid
        object, he suffers one bashing health level of damage for
        every yard he would have otherwise continued to fly. This
        damage is bashing unless the target collides with spikes or
        other lethal obstructions. Characters cannot spend more
        motes powering this Charm than their Strength.

        The character strikes with horrible crushing force,
        inflicting lethal wounds with her assault. If she inflicts at
        least one level of damage with her attack, her victim
        doubles all wound penalties until he fully heals. If this
        Charm is used on a target more than once, each subsequent
        attack increases the victim’s total wound penalty by one
        die. Once a character completely heals, his wound penalties
        reset to normal. UnExalted victims of this Charm do
        not lose their additional penalties until they receive medical
        treatment to set their broken bones.

        The Abyssal delivers a vicious open-handed blow to
        an enemy. In addition to inflicting lethal damage, her
        attack forcibly siphons blood through the target’s skin.
        The Abyssal regains 1 mote of Essence per point of raw
        damage inflicted before applying the target’s soak. This
        Charm is an exception to the usual rule that Abyssal
        Exalted can only regain Essence for actual damage inflicted.
        However, the Abyssal cannot absorb more motes
        from a single attack than the victim’s Stamina + Essence.
        Blood-Drinking Palm only works against living beings and
        Fair Folk and, then, only if the Exalt strikes bare or cloth-covered
        skin. Storytellers should require a well-described
        stunt for an Abyssal to successfully use this Charm against
        an armored opponent.

        With a painful surge of Essence, the Abyssal transforms
        her blood into deadly weapons. At the end of the
        turn, chains of iron-hard congealed blood erupt from her
        back or arms. The character grows a number of chains
        equal to her permanent Essence, and each is tipped with a
        razor-sharp claw. For the rest of the scene, the character
        gains a number of extra actions each turn equal to the
        number of chains grown. These actions can only be used to
        attack or parry. If a character uses any chains to attack, he
        cannot split his dice pool that turn, and vice versa. Blood
        chains have a length in yards and a Speed, Accuracy and
        Defense rating equal to their creator’s Essence and inflict
        a base lethal damage of the character’s Strength + Essence.
        They are wielded using the Brawl Ability. Once this
        Charm expires, the chains revert to fluid blood and disintegrate
        in a splash of gore. A character using Writhing
        Blood Chain Technique cannot use Extra Action-type
        Charms or take advantage of extra actions granted by
        other magic while this Charm remains active.

        This Charm allows the character to attune his vision
        to the flow of energy through living creatures, spirits and
        other entities with a permanent Essence rating. Such
        beings appear overlaid with a fine tracing of red veins that
        glow in direct proportion to the strength of their life force.
        While under the effects of this Charm, the character can
        perceive incorporeal spirits as though they had manifested,
        although they remain invisible to others.
        Additionally, the character may scrutinize a target’s aura
        as a simple action by spending 1 mote and his player rolling
        Perception + Martial Arts. Each success on this roll gauges
        one of the target’s following Traits as decided by the
        observer’s player: health levels remaining, permanent Essence
        rating or total current Essence pool. This Charm
        cannot discern the nature of a magical being, only its
        overall power. Thus, characters cannot determine the type
        or caste of an Exalted or differentiate between Personal
        and Peripheral Essence without other magic.

        The character suffuses her hands with the spectral

        the corpus of a ghost. As a result, players of characters
        attempting to dodge or parry blows enhanced with this
        Charm roll only half the character’s normal dice pool,
        rounded down. In addition, such attacks make no noise,
        even from impact. The Essence to power this Charm must
        be spent prior to making the attack roll. This Charm is not
        compatible with the use of weapons.

        The Exalted takes on the visage and attitude of a
        ravening shade, his pallid flesh growing cold and faintly
        translucent as he coils to lunge. For the rest of the scene,
        the character inflicts lethal damage with all hand-to-hand
        attacks. Additionally, he regains 1 mote of Essence for
        every health level of damage inflicted against animate
        targets (living creatures, spirits, undead, etc.). Lastly, the
        character may reflexively spend 3 motes per attack to
        strike dematerialized spirits, although this Charm provides
        no ability to perceive such beings. Spirits slain by this
        Charm eventually regenerate unless other magic is employed,
        but this process takes time and is extremely painful.
        Characters cannot use more than one Martial Arts Form-type
        Charm at a time. This Charm is incompatible with
        the use of armor.

        Executing a series of quick slashes in the air, the Exalt
        reaches forth her anima to siphon up expended Essence as
        it flows from her enemies. In order to use this Charm, the
        character must already have Essence Discerning Glance
        active and her target must be within 10 yards when
        spending Essence to power an effect. For the purposes of
        this Charm, the total Essence cost of all Charms in a
        Combo is considered one effect. The character’s player
        rolls Perception + Martial Arts; each success allows the
        Exalt to regain 2 motes of Essence. The character may not
        gain more Essence from a single effect than the total motes
        spent powering it, so a character that achieves three
        successes draining a Charm costing 4 motes only gains 4
        motes rather than 6. Use of this Charm does not in any way
        disrupt the effect being drained. At the end of the turn, all
        remaining motes acquired via this Charm in excess of the
        character’s permanent Essence dissipate. This limit ap-
        plies regardless of how many times this Charm is activated
        in a turn. Power Reaping Prana is explicitly permitted to
        be part of a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        Lashing out with a soul-numbing tendril of power, the
        Exalt stifles her enemy’s magic before it even takes form.
        Charms aborted in this fashion manifest as a burst of dimly
        glowing sparks that do not contribute to the victim’s anima
        banner. Abyssal characters must have Essence Discerning
        Glance active in order to perceive the use of Charms before
        they take effect, although the deathknights do not know
        which Charms are being used unless their players make a
        successful reflexive Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 2).&lt;br&gt;
        Similarly, Charm Smothering Technique can only
        counter Charms activated within 10 yards of the Exalt.
        Targets of this Charm may immediately spend a number of
        additional motes equal to the Essence invested by the
        Abyssal. If they cannot or do not pay this surcharge, their
        Charms fail, and all costs spent on the stillborn magic are
        lost. If the target pays the surcharge, the Charm takes effect
        normally. Charm Smothering Technique can only counter
        singular Charms — Combos, spells, Fair Folk glamour and
        other forms of magic cannot be smothered. Characters
        cannot spend more motes on this Charm than their Wits
        + Martial Arts, nor can they use Power Reaping Prana to
        draw energy from smothered Charms.

        The character brings to bear the ravaging power of
        Oblivion in a crackling nimbus around her hand. In
        addition to inflicting lethal damage, the character’s attack
        reduces the victim’s soak by 2L per mote spent. A target’s
        soak cannot be reduced below zero. This reduced soak only
        applies to resisting the this single attack and returns to
        normal immediately thereafter. Weakening non-magical
        armor with this Charm leaves a fine layer of rust or rot at
        the point of impact, although this decay is too minor to
        actually damage the armor.

        The character’s fingers tighten in rigid claws, and his
        skin becomes numbingly cold to the touch. In addition to
        inflicting lethal damage, his attack drains warmth on
        impact. If the attack inflicts damage, the target loses one
        dot of Dexterity. Recalculate the victim’s initiative accordingly
        and apply this new rating immediately. Characters
        who have not yet acted on the turn in which they are
        numbed have their actions delayed until their new initiative
        total. Lost Dexterity returns at the end of the scene (or
        in 10 to 15 minutes in the case of long scenes). Characters
        reduced to zero Dexterity are paralyzed and can take no
        physical action, although they may still think clearly to the
        degree allowed by their wound penalties and employ
        Charms that do not require movement. Blood Freezing
        Technique has no effect on beings immune to cold, including
        most undead and automata.

        Essence. These actions can be used for any combat-related
        tasks, subject to Storyteller approval. The character can-
        not split her dice pool on the same turn she employs this
        Charm. This Charm is incompatible with the use of armor.

        The Abyssal rushes forward, twisting and dematerializing
        as he pounces so that he passes through his enemy
        and rematerializes behind her. The subsequent attack does
        no more damage than usual, but it gains all of the benefits
        of attacking from behind (see Exalted, p. 238). This

        The deathknight delivers a powerful open-handed
        blow, Essence crackling around his clawed fingers in moaning
        arcs. The character makes the attack as normal. If the
        strike hits, roll the Abyssal’s permanent Essence against
        the permanent Essence of the victim. If the Exalt wins, the
        victim suffers unsoakable aggravated damage equal to the
        deathknight’s Martial Arts score (damage dice are rolled
        normally). This damage is in addition to any damage
        inflicted by the actual blow. Victims slain by this Charm
        arise as hungry ghosts upon the next sunset. Such ghosts
        have the usual statistics for their kind (see p. 127) but are
        never extras, and they obey the Abyssal to the best of their
        limited intelligence. Spirits and Fair Folk slain with this
        Charm are annihilated utterly and evaporate on the spot.
        This Charm is incompatible with the use of armor.

        through his weapon to strike horrible rending blows.
        The character makes his attack as normal, but successes
        count twice for the purposes of determining damage. This
        Charm must be invoked before making the attack roll.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Striking with cruel precision, an Abyssal with this
        Charm aims his blow to sever limbs and mutilate his
        opponent. Add the Abyssal’s Dexterity to the damage of
        his attack, but this attack has a difficulty of at least 3.
        Severing an arm or leg (or tentacle or similarly sized
        appendage) is difficulty 3 and requires the Exalt to inflict
        at least two health levels of damage after soak.&lt;br&gt;
        Severing a hand or putting out an eye increases the
        attack difficulty to 4 but only requires a single level of
        damage. Regardless of the actual damage rolled, the
        Abyssal’s strike only inflicts the minimum levels necessary
        for the maiming. Thus, a character who rolls five health
        levels of damage after the target’s soak only inflicts two
        levels on an attempt to sever an arm. Victims still must
        contend with bleeding and shock, however. Consider the
        amputee’s wound penalty to be twice its usual value until
        her bleeding is stanched (however, Exalted make their
        normal difficulty 1 roll).&lt;br&gt;
        Additionally, victims’ players must make a successful
        reflexive Stamina + Resistance roll for their characters to
        take any action on the turn they lose a limb. The Story-
        teller should assign other penalties or restrict actions as
        appropriate for maimed victims (see Exalted, p. 234).

        The character’s blade shrieks and moans as it be-

        deathknight makes her attack as normal but regains 1
        mote of Essence for every health level of damage inflicted.
        If the Abyssal uses a soulsteel weapon to strike a
        being with an Essence pool, she also absorbs the motes
        stolen by her weapon. This latter bonus only applies if the
        character is attuned to her weapon.

        Method duplicates the effects of Slashing Ghost Talon,
        but the bonus applies to every attack made during the

        multiple motes per health level inflicted, nor may the
        Abyssal use Slashing Ghost Talon while employing this
        Charm. A character cannot gain more Essence in a
        single turn from the use of this Charm than the
        character’s Essence + Lore.

        her with a hand-to-hand attack suffers lethal damage equal
        to the Abyssal’s Essence score. The character’s hand-to-
        hand attacks also inflict lethal damage and add her Essence
        to the damage of the attack. Mindless ghosts and walking
        dead fear characters using this Charm and will not attack
        them unless mystically compelled.

        Projecting the spiritual cold of Oblivion through
        his weapon, the Abyssal can assault the very soul and
        will of a foe. If the character’s attack hits (it need not
        inflict damage), the victim loses 1 point of temporary
        Willpower for every 2 motes spent. Exalted and other
        beings with control over their Essence pools may choose
        to lose 2 motes of Essence for every Willpower point
        they would have otherwise lost. If this Charm reduces a
        character’s temporary Willpower below zero, she suffers
        lethal damage equal to the difference. Thus, a victim
        with 3 Willpower remaining who loses 5 points suffers
        2L damage. This damage is soaked only with the
        character’s permanent Essence score and nothing else.
        The Abyssal cannot spend more motes powering this
        Charm than twice her Conviction.

        The greatest swordsmen of the deathknights can slice
        through souls as easily as others carve flesh. Upon invoking
        this Charm, the Abyssal’s weapon flares with cold fire and
        shrieks loud enough to be heard up to a mile away. The
        character makes one attack at his full dice pool, which is
        fully effective against both material beings and incorporeal
        spirits and does normal damage in addition to this Charm’s
        effects. If the blow hits, the victim’s player must immediately
        roll permanent Essence at standard difficulty.&lt;br&gt;
        If this roll succeeds, the victim suffers unsoakable dice
        of lethal damage equal to the Abyssal’s own Essence rating.
        If the roll fails, the victim loses one dot of permanent
        Essence. A botch inflicts permanent Essence loss and
        damage. If a character’s permanent Essence drops to zero,
        her life force is instantly snuffed out, and her maimed soul
        falls screaming into Oblivion.&lt;br&gt;
        Spirits and Fair Folk slain in this manner are likewise
        destroyed. Damage inflicted by Spirit-Cleaving Strike is
        purely spiritual and cannot be soaked or prevented with
        magic that solely defends against physical assault. All
        effects of this Charm are applied before resolving the
        strike’s normal damage. This Charm does not work on
        automata, the walking dead or other beings without souls.

        spent. The Abyssal may not reduce a character’s dice pool

        a Combo with Furious Blade, the Essence cost of both
        Charms increases to 2 motes per die.

        Drawing his blade and lunging in a single fluid mo-
        tion, an Abyssal with this Charm may strike faster than
        mortal eyes can follow. The character suffers no penalty for
        drawing a sheathed weapon and strikes whenever he
        wishes without regard for initiative. Although the
        character’s first action must be a Melee attack, he can still
        split his dice pool normally to take other actions later in
        the turn. However, the character cannot take any dice
        actions after the first attack until his regular initiative. If
        the character faces an opponent with similar magic, nor-
        mal initiative determines who acts first. A character can
        only use Ebon Lightning Prana once per turn, and in order
        to use it, his weapon must be sheathed. For the purposes of
        this Charm, sheathing a sword as part of a split action is a
        dice action that requires no roll, but is counted as one of
        the character’s actions for the turn.

        the petals of a blooming flower. The character may make
        one additional attack at his full dice pool for every 3
        motes spent, although he may not purchase more extra
        attacks than his Essence score. Characters must activate
        this Charm before taking their first action and may not
        split their dice pool on the same turn they employ
        Unfurling Iron Lotus. Defenders must dodge or parry
        each attack separately.

        weapons can overcome friction and gravity — even pull

        Instead of retrieving her own weapon, an Abyssal
        with Thieving Raiton Claws may attempt
        to steal the weapon of a foe.
        The Exalt reaches out an empty hand,
        and her player rolls Dexterity + Melee
        at difficulty 3. This effect cannot
        be parried or dodged. If this roll is
        successful, the effect is resolved as a
        normal disarming attempt (see Exalted,
        p. 238). If the disarming
        succeeds, the targeted weapon is torn
        from the enemy’s grasp and flies to
        the Abyssal’s own. This Charm can
        steal any weapon in the character’s
        line of sight, although it cannot seize
        magical weapons attuned to their

        With a moment’s concentration,
        an Abyssal who knows this
        Charm may banish a weapon from
        his grasp and the world. The weapon
        shimmers and vanishes Elsewhere,
        remaining hidden and inaccessible
        until the character reflexively ends
        the Charm and draws his weapon
        forth. This Charm can only banish
        a single weapon at a time, one the
        Abyssal is intimately familiar with
        — typically his most prized implement
        of battle.

        Raising her hand imperiously, a character with this
        Charm freezes raw Essence into her ideal weapon. This
        weapon appears sculpted of black crystal and glitters with
        power and malice. Although most deathknights prefer
        variations of slashing swords, this Charm can create any
        bladed weapon from ornate scythes to jagged tiger claws.
        When Resplendent Shadow Blade is purchased, the
        Abyssal’s player must decide the form of the weapon. He
        then divides a number of points equal to twice the
        character’s Melee score between the weapon’s Speed,
        Damage, Accuracy and Defense. As usual, the damage
        bonus of the weapon is added to the character’s Strength
        to determine its base lethal damage.&lt;br&gt;
        Once selected, this Charm always summons the
        same weapon. The blade’s statistics remain constant
        unless the character raises his Melee score, permitting
        him to divide two more points to its characteristics. The
        Abyssal must purchase this Charm again to conjure a
        different form of blade. Weapons created with this Charm
        have the tensile strength of soulsteel — and likewise
        drain motes equal to their owner’s permanent Essence on
        any hit that inflicts actual damage.

        The Exalt moves with preternatural grace, shifting
        his weapon without breaking form or stride to parry any
        hand-to-hand attack he is aware of. The character’s
        player rolls two dice for every mote spent but cannot
        purchase more dice than his normal defensive pool for
        the weapon. This total includes applicable specialties
        and weapon bonuses in addition to the character’s Dexterity
        + Melee. If the character has an odd number of dice
        in his pool, the fractional mote remaining after buying
        the last die is lost.

        Shifting quickly from defense to offense, the char-
        acter parries one incoming strike with a swift blow to
        the attacker’s weapon hand or limb. If the deathknight’s
        player rolls more successes than the attacker, any leftover
        successes are treated as a Melee attack against the
        aggressor. Thus, a parry that rolls five successes to
        deflect an attack with three successes becomes a two-
        success attack. This counterstrike cannot be blocked or
        dodged without magic. A character may not use Vengeful
        Riposte in response to other counterattack Charms.
        Note that this Charm does not grant the character a free
        parry or extra parry dice.

        Filling his blade with necrotic Essence as he parries, the
        Abyssal rots or rusts his opponent’s weapon to dust as it strikes
        his block. The Abyssal character’s player rolls Dexterity +
        Melee in response to any close-range attack. If even one
        success is achieved, the attacker’s weapon shatters to mildewed
        splinters and rust without injuring the defender. The
        deathknight must spend motes equal to the weapon’s base
        damage modifier plus one, so it costs 3 motes to disintegrate
        a short sword, 8 for a great axe, etc. The character can only
        disintegrate actual weapons — so no rotting off an aggressor’s
        fist or claws. Also, this Charm cannot damage weapons made
        of Essence or the Five Magical Materials.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal can dissipate the Essence
        empowering a magical weapon, rendering it
        temporarily useless. Attunement-Shattering Block may be
        activated whenever the deathknight parries a magical
        weapon. Her parry need not deflect the attack entirely, but
        the Abyssal character’s player must roll at least one success
        on the block attempt. This Charm costs 3 motes and 1
        temporary Willpower.&lt;br&gt;
        The defending character’s player then makes a reflexive
        Essence + Melee roll, with a difficulty equal to the
        target’s permanent Essence. If it succeeds, the weapon
        becomes an inert hunk of steel and Magical Materials,
        although it may be reattuned normally by its owner. Of
        course, this reattunement takes between 15 and 30 minutes.
        The victim can avert deattunement by immediately
        spending a number of motes equal to the attunement cost
        of the weapon.

        deathknight’s player may roll her character’s full Dexterity

        Abyssal is aware of.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Sometimes, the best defense is a good offense. Building
        on this principle, the Abyssal stands motionless and traces
        a lightning-fast pattern of strikes and slices around him.
        Anyone entering this warded circle risks terrible injury. The
        Exalt cannot actively attack, dodge or move faster than one
        yard per turn without breaking the Charm, but his player
        automatically rolls a full Dexterity + Melee attack against
        everyone who is currently within or who subsequently
        approaches within three yards of the character.&lt;br&gt;
        The character may also reflexively attack incoming
        projectiles of which he is aware. This is a difficulty 4
        Dexterity + Melee roll and adds the weapon’s Parry modi-
        fier as well. Success destroys or swats aside the offending
        missile. Note that this Charm does not distinguish between
        friend and foe — the Exalt must attack everyone in range.

        turn aside assaults normally impossible to parry, such as
        gouts of caustic slime or the falling boulders of a landslide.
        The character can even parry the attacks of greater spirits
        and demon lords, although such onslaughts invariably
        shatter any non-magical weapon in the process. This is a
        perfect defense.

        Suffused with malevolent hunger, the character’s
        weapon leaps from her hand and turns in flight to pursue
        its prey. After the target declares any defense, the Abyssal
        may activate this Charm to subtract one die per mote spent
        from the target’s player’s defense roll against a single
        Thrown attack the Abyssal makes. The Abyssal cannot
        spend more motes powering this Charm than are required
        to reduce a victim’s dice pool to his permanent Essence
        rating. If the target has Charms or other effects that allow
        multiple forms of defense, Hungry Missile Technique
        applies only to the first defense.

        A character with this Charm moves with impossible
        speed, plucking arrows and other missile weapons from the
        air before they can hit her. The Abyssal may reflexively
        parry any ranged attack she is aware of with her full
        Dexterity + Thrown. If this roll leaves the attacker with no
        successes, the Exalt has successfully caught the projectile
        and may subsequently do with it whatever she wishes.
        Even if the defender fails to score more successes than her
        attacker, she still reduces the damage of the attack as
        normal, so the Charm is not an all-or-nothing proposition.&lt;br&gt;
        The speed at which the character grabs incoming
        missiles is sufficient to douse most fires, including flames
        set by the Solar Charm Fiery Arrow Attack. The character
        cannot parry bolts of Essence or other purely mystical
        projectiles unless she has a permanent Essence of 3 or
        higher. If an Abyssal fully parries an intangible missile, it
        disperses harmlessly against her palm.&lt;br&gt;
        Lightning Clutch of the Raptor may also be used to
        defend against ranged area-of-effect attacks such as the
        Death of Obsidian Butterflies. This use costs 4 motes
        instead of 1, and the character only deflects missiles
        threatening her. Otherwise, parrying an area assault follows
        the same rules as any other application of this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        An Abyssal with this Charm instinctively knows
        where and how to throw his weapon to deliver a fatal blow.
        The player makes an attack roll as normal, but the damage
        is doubled after it is rolled. However, if this not enough to
        kill the target outright, the strike only inflicts one automatic
        unsoakable health level of damage. As an ancillary
        benefit, the character’s attack inflicts lethal damage (at
        least 1L) if it didn’t already, so this attack can be used to
        throw tiny or unconventional weapons such as dominos
        with Range 10, Accuracy +0, Rate 3.

        Underworld. The weapon’s range increases by one factor
        for every 2 motes spent. Thus, a character that spends 2
        motes doubles her attack’s range, while one who spends 4
        motes triples it, etc. Characters cannot spend more 2-mote
        increments activating this Charm than they have points of
        permanent Essence.

        With a subtle flick of her wrist, an Abyssal who knows
        this Charm may extrude a slender bone needle from her
        palm or fingertip. The needle itself is quite small — no
        more than the length of a child’s finger — but its paralytic
        venom coating helps make up for its size. Needles created
        with this Charm have a base lethal damage and Accuracy
        equal to the character’s Essence rating and a Range in yards
        of five times this value. Without other magic, a character
        cannot throw more than three needles per turn. Note that
        needles do not add Strength for determining damage,
        although attack successes contribute normally. Needles
        remain envenomed for one hour after creation. Players of
        unarmored characters struck by a poisoned needle must
        reflexively roll Stamina + Resistance against a difficulty of
        the Abyssal’s Medicine score. Exalted victims whose players
        fail this roll suffer levels of unsoakable lethal damage
        equal to the deathknight’s Essence. UnExalted victims
        whose players fail die painfully after one day unless treated
        with curative magic. The Abyssal Exalt is naturally im-
        mune to her own poison.

        The character channels Essence through her entire
        skeleton, growing hundreds of Essence-laden bone needles
        similar to those produced with Ivory Spine Attack. Within
        seconds, the needles tear through her skin at high velocity,
        saturating the immediate area with razor-sharp spikes.
        Everyone within five yards of the Exalt suffers lethal
        damage (soaked normally) equal to the Abyssal’s Stamina
        + Thrown + Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        This damage is reduced by one die for every yard
        further out, so victims six yards away suffer (Stamina
        + Thrown + Essence - 1)L, etc. This damage cannot be
        dodged or blocked without a stunt or Charm. Successes
        on dodge or block attempts reduce the damage
        by 1L per success. Needles created with this Charm
        disintegrate seconds after their explosive flight. Armored
        characters may not use this Charm, as their
        armor blunts the explosion.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal may fling a burrowing
        splinter of gleaming bone at his target. Upon striking a
        living victim, the spine rapidly burrows into her body and
        begins its painful journey to her heart. The needle has the
        same statistics as one created with Ivory Spine Attack,
        although it is not poisonous. Rather, if it successfully hits
        a victim, it begins inflicting one die of unsoakable lethal
        damage each minute. This damage continues until the
        victim dies or the Abyssal wills the needle to temporarily
        stop. The Abyssal can later will the needle to resume its
        path at any time. The spine itself remains in existence as
        long as the Abyssal leaves Essence committed to it or until
        its victim dies. Skilled doctors can sometimes remove a
        Burrowing Bone Maggot, but the Dexterity + Medicine
        roll for such surgery has a minimum difficulty of 4 and
        requires a sharp knife and the surgeon’s undivided dice
        action for 10 turns (half a minute).

        A thrown weapon enchanted with this Charm be-
        comes an extension of its owner’s malice, arcing and
        ricocheting from one target to the next like a swooping
        bird of prey. The weapon makes a number of separate
        attacks equal to the character’s Thrown score. Each
        attack is made at the Abyssal’s full dice pool, with no
        subtractions for multiple actions. If an attack misses, the
        weapon simply moves on to its next target. However, if
        any roll botches, the weapon strikes an unintended
        victim and falls to the ground. Otherwise, the weapon
        faithfully returns to its master’s hand at the end of the
        turn. All targets of Pitiless Scything Razor must be in
        range when the character first throws the weapon, and no
        target may be hit more than once with a given weapon
        during a single use of this Charm.

        Imbued with a measure of its master’s bloodlust, a
        weapon enchanted with this Charm leaps from its master’s
        hand to slake itself on the life energy of its prey. Ravening
        Crimson Chakram duplicates the effects of Pitiless Scything
        Razor with two key differences: First, the thrown weapon
        can attack the same target more than once. Second, the
        weapon actually feeds when it hits, absorbing 1 mote of
        Essence for every health level of damage inflicted after soak.
        If the Abyssal’s player does not botch any attack rolls, the
        deathknight gains all harvested motes when he recovers his
        weapon at the end of the turn. Soulsteel throwing weapons
        also drain motes as normal for each attack.

        As befitting the champions of the Underworld, Abyssal
        Exalted are far more resilient than mere mortals and
        may purchase extra health levels as if they were a Charm.
        This Charm can be taken as many times as a character has
        dots of Endurance. Each Ox-Body Technique purchased
        provides one of the following, decided by the player at the

        The Abyssal enfolds his anima about his armor, grant-

        the character reduces the fatigue value and mobility penalty
        of his armor by one point, to a maximum possible reduction
        equal to his permanent Essence. A fatigue value of zero
        indicates the character need never roll to see if he becomes
        fatigued from wearing his armor. This Charm cannot reduce

        An Abyssal with this Charm may revivify himself with
        Essence, allowing him to act at full strength without penalties
        for sleep loss or exhaustion. There is no limit to how many
        days this Charm can be used in a row, but animating death
        Essence is a poor substitute for natural rest. After a number of
        days equal to the character’s Stamina + Endurance, the Exalt
        begins to suffer one unsoakable level of bashing damage each
        time the Charm is used. This damage does not heal until the
        character stops using the Charm. Once a character ends use
        of Tireless Sentinel Technique, he cannot safely reactivate it
        until all damage from the Charm has been healed. Doing
        otherwise only continues the process of decay.

        loses his Exaltation and its commiserate powers, but he

        any supernatural martial-arts forms he may know up to and
        including the Form (but not more advanced techniques)
        and gains twice as many Arcanoi as a starting ghost. The
        Storyteller has final say on what Traits the character keeps
        and how many ghost Charms he can purchase, etc.

        attack inflicts, her player may roll one die. Each success on
        this roll restores 1 mote of Essence, up to the character’s
        usual limit. A character cannot harvest more Essence from
        a single attack than her Essence rating.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Many Abyssal Exalted show disturbing indifference
        to suffering. When this Charm is purchased, the player
        must decide whether to permanently inure the Exalt
        against the worst of his pain or cultivate a more powerful
        numbing for short-term use. In the former case, the Exalt
        permanently subtracts 2 from all wound penalties. Such
        anesthetizing does not accelerate healing, so a -2 level
        reduced to -0 still regenerates as a -2. However, this
        penalty reduction is cumulative, so characters buying this
        Charm twice subtract 4 from their wound penalties. Once
        this Charm is purchased three times, the Exalt is thereafter
        immune to all but the most unimaginably terrible agony.
        In its configuration as a temporary anesthetic, this
        Charm allows characters to dampen pain with Essence.
        For every mote spent, the Exalt can ignore one die of
        wound penalties. This Charm can be used multiple times
        in a scene, with cumulative effect. Characters can even
        negate more dice of wound penalties than they currently
        suffer from in preparation for future injury. Exalted who
        know the temporary and permanent form of this Charm
        combine both effects when determining their final wound
        penalty reduction.

        handedly. The Abyssal’s player rolls Conviction. Each
        success restores one point of Willpower.

        says. The character can add 2 dice to a Performance or

        A deathknight can channel Essence into a mourn-
        ful song so that members of his audience, willing or
        otherwise, start to die as they listen to it. Their bodies
        weaken as their life Essence is sucked away into the
        Underworld. Each listener suffers 1L for every 2 motes
        spent on the Charm, up to a maximum damage equal to
        the deathknight’s permanent Essence. This damage
        leaves no physical mark and may only be soaked with
        Stamina or soak-boosting Charms. Characters can only
        use this Charm once per turn, although they may acti-
        vate it on subsequent turns to continue their song
        unabated. The exact nature of a Withering Dirge de-
        pends on the Abyssal, but there is no mechanical
        difference between an achingly beautiful requiem and a
        piercing scream of anguish. Nonliving beings and the
        deaf are immune to this Charm.

        blast. The character’s player rolls Manipulation + Performance
        to hit a single target, inflicting a base damage of 1L
        for every mote of Essence spent. Extra successes add as
        normal. This attack cannot be parried, only dodged, and
        may be soaked only with Stamina and other natural soak
        enhancers. Lamenting Ghost Technique has a range of
        (the character’s Performance x 10) yards. An Abyssal may

        Stamina + Essence.

        Preaching the veneration of death and the dead is
        seen as a sacred obligation by many deathknights. Such
        adulation serves two purposes: strengthening the power of
        the Underworld and garnering useful allies among the
        dead. To these ends, Abyssal Exalted with this Charm may
        channel the prayers of a living congregation to empower
        the dead. A memorial service can be directed at a single
        ghost or the dead in general, as decided by the Exalt, but
        such worship can only be carried out at night.&lt;br&gt;
        If targeting a single ghost, the Abyssal spends one or
        more hours leading his assembled congregation in prayers
        to the honored deceased. Such prayers can take the form
        of a high ritual, a mournful song or dance — even a
        lighthearted wake. After each hour, the character’s player
        rolls dice equal to the number of active participants. The
        total number of dice cannot be greater than twice the
        deathknight’s Charisma + Performance. A ghost who is
        subject of such a celebration regains 1 mote of Essence for
        every success rolled — or half that number if she is not
        physically present at the memorial.&lt;br&gt;
        If used to facilitate general worship of death, this
        Charm uses the same system. However, the total Essence
        generated is divided evenly among all ghosts through the
        mausoleums of Stygia.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal may instantly command
        fear and respect from an assembled crowd. Audience
        members may not like her performance or believe her
        words, but they recognize the implicit malice she embodies
        and treat her accordingly. In short, they may not like her,
        but they know better than to heckle or depart before the
        end of the show. A few disturbed souls may actually find
        the Abyssal more alluring as a result of her dangerous edge,
        but these are the exception, not the rule. This Charm only
        works on non-magical beings.

        An Abyssal with this Charm can inflame or harden
        the passions of the living and the dead alike. The character
        speaks with smoldering fervor or cold certainty, lending
        supernatural conviction to her words and mannerisms.
        The Abyssal’s player selects an emotion and rolls Manipulation
        + Performance at difficulty 2. If the desired emotion
        is innately negative — such as hate, fear or sorrow—this
        roll is made at standard difficulty.&lt;br&gt;
        Targets whose Willpower score is less than the number
        of successes rolled are completely overwhelmed by the
        emotional onslaught and act accordingly. A crowd suffused
        with rage is apt to riot, while a celibate monk
        overcome with lust seeks to indulge his previously repressed
        desire. Targets with a Willpower less than twice
        the number of successes rolled may make a Willpower roll
        (difficulty 1) to resist the emotion. Individuals whose
        Willpower exceeds twice the successes rolled are completely
        unaffected. The emotional tampering caused by
        this Charm only lasts for one scene, although low Temperance
        characters may continue to indulge themselves for
        some time afterward, at Storyteller discretion.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm can also induce apathy, rather than
        passion. This requires the same roll, but affected characters
        find themselves emotionally numbed. Everything
        feels crushingly bleak and hollow. This effect can be
        used to quell riots, as apathetic mobs quickly lose inertia
        and disperse.

        An Abyssal Exalt who knows this Charm can radiate
        a nimbus of cold dread that saps the morale of enemies. All
        enemy troops within a radius of (the character’s Conviction
        x 100) yards feel terror seize their hearts. Soldiers
        ensorcelled with this Charm lose 1 die from all combat dice
        pools and their players suffer a +1 difficulty on all Valor
        rolls. The effect of this Charm on the overall outcome of
        a battle rests within the Storyteller’s discretion, but its
        influence should be considerable.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Although many deathknight generals prefer mute
        legions of zombies to unpredictable mortal troops, a few
        recognize the power of the human spirit — and the beauty
        in crushing that spirit to serve the will of the Deathlords.
        Abyssals who know this Charm can transform a motley
        crew of peaceful farmers and children into competent
        merciless killers with disturbing ease.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters may supervise a maximum of (their Es-
        sence rating x 100) soldiers in a given week. Soldiers
        trained for a month or longer are considered elite troops.
        They are quite disciplined, with relevant combat Abilities
        rated at 3 or higher and usually a specialty or two in a
        favored weapon.&lt;br&gt;
        More importantly, this brutal training regimen gradu-
        ally wears away humanity and replaces it with psychotic
        malice. For every two weeks that a soldier undergoes this
        instruction, she loses one dot of Compassion and gains a
        dot of either Valor or Conviction. By the time they
        graduate, the new soldiers typically have Compassion 1
        and five or more dots divided between Conviction and
        Valor. Continued use of this Charm only further increases
        the combat prowess of the Abyssal’s troops.

        &lt;br&gt;
        An Abyssal using this Charm radiates terrible allure. His
        words resound with unholy power and conviction, while his
        every gesture bespeaks grace and nobility. The Exalt’s player
        adds a number of dice equal to his character’s permanent
        Essence to all Presence, Socialize and Bureaucracy rolls
        involving one-on-one interaction. This bonus also applies to
        all intimidation attempts, regardless of the number of onlook-
        ers present. Note that this Charm engenders respect and fear
        — it does not win friends or make the Exalt more likeable.

        &lt;br&gt;
        An Abyssal using this Charm may issue orders to the
        dead and demand their obedience. If targeting mindless
        undead or hungry ghosts, the cost of the Charm is 5 motes,
        plus 1 mote for every additional target beyond the first.
        Actual ghosts require 10 motes, plus 3 motes per additional
        target, and the Exalt must have a permanent Essence of 3
        or higher to control such beings.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt’s player rolls Manipulation + Presence against
        a difficulty of the target’s permanent Essence. If targeting
        multiple beings, use the highest Essence rating in the group.
        The amount of control the character has depends on the
        number of successes rolled. One success is sufficient to bark
        simple harmless commands that do not violate the target’s
        Nature (“Back off!” for example). With three successes, the
        target must completely obey the Exalt, although sentient
        targets may ignore commands that would cause them physical
        harm. With five successes, the target does anything the
        Exalt commands for the duration of the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Keep in mind that the walking dead aren’t the brightest
        creatures and have difficulty comprehending anything
        more complicated than a simple sentence. While more
        intelligent, ghosts are similarly limited by language. The
        dead cannot obey instructions they do not understand,
        regardless of their degree of obedience. Ensorcelled targets
        never attack their master, however — at least, not until
        they regain their own free will.&lt;br&gt;
        An Abyssal may also use Command the Dead to usurp
        control of walking dead and ghosts from other necromancers.
        This follows the same rules, except that the difficulty
        is the Essence rating of the targets’ current master. Characters
        cannot usurp control from necromancers with a
        higher permanent Essence than their own.

        raised with this Charm obey their maker to the best of
        their limited intelligence and have the same statistics as
        common zombies (see Exalted, p. 298). These monsters
        are always extras.

        Prerequisite Charms: Elegant Tyrant’s Majesty&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Irresistible Succubus Style heightens an Abyssal’s
        cold beauty, transforming her visage to match her idealized
        form. Deathknights using this Charm are alabaster angels
        or onyx goddesses, achingly beautiful apparitions with
        flawless skin and ruby lips. A character adds her permanent
        Essence to her Appearance rating as long as she remains
        enchanted. This metamorphosis is no illusion, however,
        but an ideal brought to life with Essence. As such, the
        character’s altered beauty cannot be pierced by magic that
        detects glamour or illusions.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition to augmenting her beauty, this Charm
        also causes the Abyssal to exude an aura of seduction.
        Players of characters who behold the Exalt or interact with
        her must make a successful Temperance roll. If the roll
        fails, the characters find the Abyssal overwhelmingly
        desirable regardless of their normal sexual preference.
        They will not harm the Exalt and are likely to behave
        irrationally in an attempt to impress her. If the Exalt
        actually wishes to seduce a smitten character, she may do
        so without a roll.&lt;br&gt;
        This aura has no effect on beings with an Essence
        rating higher than the Exalt invoking the Charm, nor does
        it affect the Fair Folk. Similarly, this aura has no effect on
        characters engaged in combat or who otherwise believe
        the Abyssal means them harm. Overtly hostile acts on the
        part of the Exalt may render a particular subject immune
        but do not prevent this Charm from enthralling others.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By staring intently at a target, an Abyssal with this
        Charm can sap that victim’s will and subjugate her spirit.
        The target must be within five yards and must be able to see
        the Exalt when Soul-Flaying Gaze is invoked. If these
        conditions are met, the target finds her vision drawn to the
        deathknight’s own eyes.&lt;br&gt;
        As their gazes connect, the Abyssal’s player rolls
        Manipulation + Presence in a resisted roll against the
        target’s Willpower. If the Exalt wins, the target is immediately
        entranced and can take no further actions that turn.
        Additionally, the victim loses a number of points of
        Willpower equal to the Abyssal’s permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        If the target wins, the Charm has no effect. A
        character who loses all Willpower from this Charm
        become highly suggestible to the Abyssal. Although she
        cannot be ordered to do anything to harm herself or
        others (unless naturally predisposed to do so), such a
        hapless individual otherwise obeys the Exalt for the rest
        of the scene. This control shatters immediately if the
        victim suffers actual damage, although she must regain
        lost Willpower normally.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Layering his speech with a haunting chorus of voices,
        the Abyssal may implant hidden commands in a target’s
        psyche. Roll the character’s Manipulation + Presence in a
        resisted contest against the target’s Willpower. If the target
        wins, she immediately knows what the Exalt attempted to
        do and the precise conditions of the suggestion. If the Exalt
        wins, however, he may issue one order.&lt;br&gt;
        This instruction can be as simple or complicated as
        desired, but the intended task cannot take longer than the
        Abyssal’s Essence rating in turns. The suggestion remains
        until its conditions are met or a number of days equal to the
        Manipulation of the Exalt have passed. During this time,
        the target has no conscious recollection of her orders. Even
        after the target carries out her instructions, she does not
        recall the act unless specified to do so. Even if she remembers
        her actions, she does not connect them with a hypnotic
        suggestion unless she has other reason to believe such
        tampering occurred. This Charm cannot make characters
        hurt themselves or others unless they are already strongly
        predisposed to do so.

        &lt;br&gt;
        An Abyssal with this Charm blazes with unholy
        power and radiates unimaginable soul-chilling horror,
        causing his anima to flare as if he had spent 15 motes of
        Peripheral Essence. While Heart-Stopping Mien is in
        effect, a successful reflexive Valor roll is required each turn
        to attack the character or to voluntarily approach within
        two yards of him. If an aggressor fails, she suffers unsoakable
        lethal damage equal to the Abyssal’s Essence rating. Characters
        that suffer more damage in this fashion than their
        Stamina spend the rest of the turn writhing in agony and
        lose their action.&lt;br&gt;
        Injuries inflicted by this Charm typically manifest as
        heart attacks or strokes, although more exotic torments are
        not unheard of. Magical beings (including other Exalts) do
        not suffer this damage but, instead, cannot attack the
        deathknight on a turn that their players fail a Valor roll.
        Those who can attack the Abyssal do so at a die penalty
        equal to the deathknight’s permanent Essence. This Charm
        is not compatible with the Dusk Caste anima power.

        character may add one point to his bashing soak. Additionally,

        and lethal soak for every mote spent in their creation, as

        This multipurpose Charm allows characters to ex-
        trude spikes and razor spines over their entire body or to
        grow weapons from their limbs. If used to grow spines, the
        Charm costs 8 motes, 1 Willpower and one lethal health
        level. The lattice of blades provides an additional soak of
        2B/2L that stacks with soak bonuses from other Charms.
        Additionally, characters encased in blades can inflict
        lethal damage with all “unarmed” hand-to-hand attacks,
        including wrestling maneuvers such as clinches and tack-
        les. Finally, anyone who grapples a character with spines or
        strikes her barehanded must immediately soak a number of
        dice of lethal damage equal to his own Strength.&lt;br&gt;
        Growing melee weapons with Bone Arsenal Method
        costs one lethal health level, as well as 1 mote for every
        +1 invested in Speed, Accuracy, Defense or lethal dam-
        age (all of which begin at a rating of 0). Characters
        cannot raise any of these Traits higher than their perma-
        nent Essence. Although weapons created with this Charm
        can take virtually any form, they remain obvious exten-
        sions of their creator’s skeleton and cannot be dropped or

        Characters with Ivory Blossom Carapace activated do

        blows as if it were made of the finest steel. When this

        Apart from its appearance, Crimson Petal Armor
        follows the same rules as Ivory Blossom Carapace, ex-

        no mobility penalty. Characters cannot activate this
        Charm while using Ivory Blossom Carapace (or vice
        versa), just as with any other armor. Characters only
        need to spend Willpower the first time they activate
        this Charm during a scene.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Building on the principle of Crimson Petal Armor,
        this Charm allows an Abyssal to momentarily liquefy her
        body and possessions to shrug off any blow or assault. Upon
        impact, she seamlessly melts into gore and then re-solidifies,
        allowing the attack to pass harmlessly through her
        without resistance. This process is particularly gruesome
        when defending against falls and other full-body trauma, as
        the character splatters into a mass of congealed blood and
        immediately reforms without injury. Characters using this
        Charm take no damage from a single attack but must
        contend with secondary effects normally. This momentary
        invulnerability duplicates the protection granted by the
        Solar Charm Adamant Skin Technique (see Exalted, p.
        177) and is a form of perfect defense. A character must
        invoke Flowing Wound Defense after his opponent spends
        any motes to activate Charms but before the foe makes her
        actual attack roll.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Some Abyssal Exalted become highly resistant to
        disease as a result of their consecration to the Malfeans. As
        with Ox Body Technique, this blessing can be purchased
        as if it were a Charm. Players of characters with Plague
        Knows Its Master subtract their characters’ permanent
        Essence from the difficulty of all Stamina + Resistance and
        Stamina + Endurance rolls to resist or throw off infection
        and disease. In the case of avoiding infected wounds, this
        reduction is cumulative with the -2 modifier all Exalted
        share. If the final difficulty of any modified roll is reduced
        below 1, the character automatically avoids contracting
        the illness or successfully purges it from his system (as
        appropriate to the roll in question).

        The character amplifies her metabolism with Essence,
        strengthening her body’s resistance to poison. For
        the rest of the scene, the Exalt nullifies any poison she is
        exposed to that has a resistance difficulty lower than her
        permanent Essence. Against stronger poisons, the Exalt’s
        player may add her character’s Essence in automatic successes
        to her Stamina + Resistance roll. Characters need
        not evoke this Charm before exposure to toxins, as long as
        they activate it before rolling to resist. Incidental toxins
        such as spoiled food are generally considered difficulty 1 or
        2 for the purposes of this Charm. Characters protected by
        this Charm may safely consume an additional number of
        alcoholic drinks equal to their Resistance without penalty.

        Corrupted in body and spirit by the power of the
        Malfeans, some Abyssal Exalted find their very blood
        tainted with vile poison. Once a character purchases this
        Charm, venom suffuses every fluid in her body. This
        poison has the same statistics as arrow frog venom (see
        Exalted, p. 243). Players of living beings consuming or
        otherwise internalizing these tainted fluids (such as through
        kissing or more intimate contact) must succeed at a Stamina
        + Resistance roll or have their characters suffer the full
        deleterious effects of the poison. This Charm cannot be
        turned off or suppressed — the corruption is irreversible.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can dramatically speed
        the process of donning his armor. He need only gesture to
        it, and his anima flows out to enfold the armor in a liquid
        shroud of darkness. By the end of the turn, the anima
        slithers back and fastens the armor perfectly in place. The
        character must have the armor readily available and at
        hand to use this Charm and may not grab his armor from
        further away than his Essence in yards.

        An Abyssal who knows this Charm can store his armor
        Elsewhere, recalling it only as needed for battle. The character
        must be wearing his armor with all its straps and
        fastenings fitted properly to banish it. If these conditions are
        met, the armor vanishes in a flash of ghostly light. At any
        time, the character may concentrate and summon his armor
        from Elsewhere, causing it to reappear on his person with a
        scream of torn air. A character can only have one suit of
        armor stored Elsewhere at a time and may not recall it unless
        she is unarmored to receive it. Void-Banished Mail cannot
        banish armor substantially larger than the Exalt, so it is
        impossible to hide warstriders with this Charm.

        The Abyssal’s anima hardens, encasing her in a suit of
        obsidian-black plate mail. This armor is an expression of
        the character’s soul, and thus, it reflects her personality
        and temperament. It may be ornate and decorated with
        weeping faces and skulls or elegant in its simplicity — it is
        the character’s ideal armor. Inauspicious Shadow Plate
        provides 10L/10B soak, with only a -1 mobility penalty.
        For an additional 2 motes, the deathknight can also grow
        a sweeping black cape that moves and flows of its own
        accord to entangle and snag incoming blows. This cloak
        acts like a shield, increasing the difficulty of all attacks
        against the Exalt by +1.

        Lacking ready sources of Essence apart from cannibal-
        ism, Abyssal Exalted must often conserve their power in
        Creation. Deathknights with this Charm can offset this
        weakness somewhat by bloating their animas with stolen
        power. For each time this Charm is taken, the Abyssal adds
        an additional 10 motes to his Peripheral Essence pool.
        However, the Exalt can only fill this extra capacity by
        consuming flesh or blood or by using Essence-draining
        magic. The character cannot recharge this bonus pool
        with Hearthstones, respiration or any other passive means.
        Characters cannot take this Charm more times than their
        permanent Essence rating.

        Once an Abyssal masters this Charm, he can subsist
        entirely on a diet of human blood. The character must drink
        a number of health levels per day equal to his permanent
        Essence if he wishes to replace his body’s need for regular
        food. While subsisting on blood, characters suffer no dietary
        deficiencies. Many deathknights who learn this Charm find
        their palettes prefer the sweet taste of life to blander solid
        food. Note that blood consumed specifically as sustenance
        for this Charm does not provide Essence.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can intensify his aura of
        menace to ward off animals. Herbivores and domesticated
        beasts avoid the character completely and panic if directly
        confronted. Most non-magical predators keep their distance,
        fighting only as a last resort if cornered. This Charm
        has less effect on magical beasts and super-predators such
        as tyrant lizards and siaka. Such beings can overcome the
        aversion with a successful Willpower roll, although they
        still suffer a +1 difficulty to attack the Exalt.

        By beating an animal into submission or otherwise
        abusing it to establish dominance, an Abyssal with this
        Charm can mystically chain a beast to her will. The
        character gains one dot of the Familiar Background each
        time she uses this Charm, although she can only have one
        Familiar at a time. Thus, it would take three applications
        of this Charm to enslave a wild omen dog and another two
        to gain communication and sharing of senses. Although
        dangerous animals make superior slaves, it takes consider-
        ably more work to tame them. Beating an angry bear until
        it cowers in obedience can be problematic at best, to say
        nothing of subduing a full-grown tyrant lizard. Characters
        should prepare for appropriately epic combat unless they
        plan on raising such monsters from birth.

        While most deathknights can only absorb Essence
        from the blood and flesh of other sentient beings, a few
        have learned to draw power from lesser creatures. Once a
        character purchases this Charm, he can devour animals to
        regain Essence. Such prey must be consumed within minutes
        of death and cannot be cooked or otherwise prepared.
        Additionally, the animal must be a predator or scavenger.
        If these conditions are met, the Exalt regains 1 mote for
        every two health levels eaten. Otherwise, the meal affords
        only physical sustenance.

        She can withstand brutal extremes of temperature without ill
        effect and need never fear hypothermia, frostbite, parasites,
        sand blindness or any other hazard of the wilderness. This
        resistance applies to virtually any condition a human body
        could actually survive, however briefly. Thus, a character
        could trudge naked through a blizzard without discomfort but
        would not have an easier time breathing underwater or
        surviving a raging bonfire. Ultimately, the limits of this
        Charm are left to Storyteller discretion.

        Pulling his arms and legs together like a corpse ready for
        burial, an Abyssal with this Charm can mystically sink into
        the earth. This process buries the character a full yard
        underground, leaving no trace of excavation on the surface.
        The character slips into a state of suspended animation for
        the duration of the Charm and does not breathe, although
        he still hungers normally. Sheltering Interment Prana lasts
        one hour for every 3 motes spent, unless the torpid character
        is injured or uncovered by digging. Once the Charm ends for
        whatever reason, the character arises to the surface in a
        shower of dirt and immediately regains consciousness. Characters
        may regain Essence while interred (assuming they are
        in a location that permits it), although motes used to power
        the Charm remain committed during its duration.

        By definition, few environments are as inhospitable

        afford little in the way of palatable meat. With this Charm,
        however, an Abyssal may readily consume spectral food
        and derive full nourishment from her meal.

        or similarly convoluted network of passages. This Charm
        also aids in navigating the Labyrinth beneath the Under-

        sane comprehension, both for its size and alien geometry.

        add one die per mote to any roll to track a single target
        individual. This target must be decided when the Charm
        is invoked and cannot later be changed. Bonus dice gained
        from this Charm apply to all tracking attempts until the
        character finds his quarry or gives up his hunt, although
        this Charm cannot more than double a character’s dice
        pool. Infallible Barghest Mien aids in tracking regardless of
        environment; the character can stalk his quarry through
        the twisting streets of a necropolis as readily as any wilder-
        ness. Characters may only benefit from one application of
        this Charm at a time. Characters using this Charm are

        For the duration of this Charm, the character passes as
        unobtrusively as a phantom. She leaves no footprints or
        scent or any sign of her passing that can be detected by
        conventional means. The character can also extend this
        protection to a maximum number of companions equal to
        her permanent Essence rating at a cost of 5 motes each.
        Only characters with supernatural tracking abilities can
        hope to follow an Exalt shrouded by this Charm, and such
        attempts are resolved through a normal tracking contest.

        By attuning her gaze to the seeds of entropy in all
        things, an Abyssal using this Charm can perceive the weak
        points of any inanimate object. Fracture lines and hidden
        cracks appear stained oily black, while even the slightest
        traces of rot or rust glow hideous shades of brown and red.
        With this knowledge, characters may exploit or repair the
        flaws they find with greater facility.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters attempting to repair faults identified with
        this Charm may double any Craft-related dice pool to do
        so. However, such repairs require the same effort, time and
        tools as normal. Similarly, characters attacking a scruti-
        nized object’s weak points count extra successes twice for
        the purpose of determining damage with their first strike.
        Subsequent attacks do not receive this bonus unless the
        character uses Fault-Finding Scrutiny to reevaluate the
        object’s weaknesses.

        The Exalt channels corrosive Essence directly into an
        object, triggering rapid decay. (Material) Withering
        Method is actually three separate Charms, each encompassing
        a different substance: wood, metal and stone.
        Although the three versions decay their respective material
        differently — rotting, rusting or crumbling as
        appropriate — the final result is the same: The object
        disintegrates to nothing within seconds. This Charm can
        only be used on objects the size of a large weapon or a single
        suit of armor. (Material) Withering Method has no effect
        on enchanted items, including those made from or reinforced
        by the Five Magical Materials. All versions of this
        Charm have a range of (the Abyssal’s permanent Essence
        x 10) yards and may only be used once per turn.

        This Charm makes an object highly resistant to natu-
        ral and unnatural forms of decay, including corrosion, rust,
        rot and even simple weathering. For ordinary wear and
        tear, treated objects endure at least 10 times as long as
        untreated counterparts. Against more aggressive causes of
        decay, such as acid baths or bolts of raw entropy, treated
        objects have double the usual soak or resistance dice pool.
        Although this enhancement is permanent, it only protects
        against decay. Treated objects have no additional resilience
        against other sources of damage and may be cut,
        burnt or otherwise broken as easily as normal. This Charm
        does not work on living beings.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can fashion prosthetics
        of iron and carved bone and affix them to living flesh as
        replacements for missing limbs. The Exalt must first build
        the actual prosthesis, which requires a number of creation
        rolls as outlined on pages 245 and 246 of Exalted, usually
        using Craft (Necrosurgery). If successful, the character can
        use this Charm to join the implant with its host. The
        recipient must commit Essence (or Willpower, in the case
        of mortals) to attune the device to her life force. Generally,
        a hand requires 3 motes or 1 point of Willpower, while a
        full arm requires 5 motes or 2 Willpower. Entire legs can
        take as many as 8 motes or 3 Willpower. So long as the cost
        remains attuned, the prosthesis behaves entirely as its
        organic counterpart. Owing to their sturdy construction,
        prosthetics designed with this Charm have a +2L/2B soak
        against damage of any sort.

        This Charm allows a character to repair any broken
        object, so long as some fragment remains. The character
        must spend a number of hours working on the object equal
        to (10 - her permanent Essence), while she painstakingly
        joins shards and binds them with wisps of memory dredged
        from the winds of the Underworld. This Charm cannot
        remake intangible items (such as broken promises) or
        restore objects more yards in radius than the character’s
        permanent Essence. Form-Restoring Touch can repair
        items of First Age manufacture but can do nothing to mend
        those whose magic has fled or been exhausted.

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        The character grows cold and detached, studying the
        world with heartless scrutiny. For each mote of Essence
        spent, the player may add 1 die to an Investigation roll, but
        the number of bonus dice cannot more than double the
        character’s base Attribute + Ability pool. This bonus may
        be maintained for extended investigations, research or
        interrogation sessions. However, the bonus only applies to
        a single specific task that can last no longer than a scene.
        This Charm can only enhance one task at a time.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Prince of Shadows has a prisoner brought
        before him. He uses Excellent Inquisitor Attitude for the
        purpose of interrogating her, spending 4 motes to gain four
        bonus dice. Since he plans to spend the full scene torturing his
        captive, this bonus applies to all related Investigation rolls for
        the scene. However, he receives no bonus to search the
        prisoner’s belongings or to notice clues evident in her dress or
        accent, since these tasks are unrelated to interrogation.

        by deliberate lies. This Charm is infallible within its limits,
        but only detects deliberate falsehoods. Characters who
        sincerely believe a falsehood do not register as having lied,
        nor do characters who answer in an unclear manner or
        withhold information (including those who refuse to answer
        at all). Deception-Piercing Stare cannot compel or

        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Investigation: 4&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Deception-Piercing Stare&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal inflicts terrible pain on
        anyone who disrespectfully answers her questions with lies
        or silence. This Charm only applies to the extended
        interrogation of one individual whose Willpower + Essence
        is less than the Exalt’s Manipulation + Investigation.
        The player of an affected character must reflexively roll
        Willpower against a difficulty of the Exalt’s permanent
        Essence whenever he attempts to lie or withhold relevant
        information. If the roll succeeds, the character can answer
        or remain silent as he wishes, although the Exalt can repeat
        the question on the following turn if she is dissatisfied with
        the response. If the roll fails, the victim suffers one
        unsoakable level of bashing damage and spends the rest of
        the turn in agony. The Abyssal may not control or lessen
        this damage after invoking Unsurpassed Interrogation
        Method except by prematurely ending the Charm. It is
        possible for victims to kill themselves with repeated lies,
        although they are not punished for speaking falsehoods
        they sincerely believe. The Abyssal can normally ask one
        question per turn, though complicated questions may
        require additional turns to phrase or answer. This Charm
        can only be used on a given target once per week.

        Prerequisite Charms: Unsurpassed Interrogation Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Building on the principle of Unsurpassed Interrogation
        Method, this Charm allows a character to torture
        victims with the force of her preternatural will. The Exalt’s
        player must make a Conviction + Essence roll, resisted by
        the victim’s Willpower + Essence. For every success rolled
        beyond the victim’s, the Abyssal can psychically inflict
        one level of unsoakable bashing or lethal damage or
        remove one point of temporary Willpower from the victim’s
        pool. If so desired, the Abyssal’s player can apply fewer
        successes than he actually rolled. Characters reduced be-
        low zero temporary Willpower with this Charm gain a
        derangement chosen by the Storyteller and fall catatonic
        for the remainder of the scene. Wounds inflicted by this
        Charm take whatever form the Abyssal desires, although
        stigmata and artistically broken bones are common motifs.
        The Charm only affects a single restrained or willingly
        motionless victim within 5 yards of the Exalt, severely
        limiting its combat application. Additionally, the Charm
        has no effect on characters with a higher permanent
        Essence than the Abyssal.

        Through careful examination of undisturbed physical
        evidence at a scene, the character can mentally recon-
        struct the process that led to that evidence. For example,
        characters finding a dead body may analyze its wounds to
        determine the angle of attack, the type of weapon used,
        etc. Although primarily employed for forensic purposes,
        this Charm may just as easily reconstruct the evidence left
        by liaisons or the details of an abandoned campsite.
        This Charm functions automatically only so long as
        there is abundant physical evidence. Where evidence is
        lacking — or has been disturbed — the player must instead
        roll Perception + Investigation at a difficulty determined
        by the amount of tampering. Success allows the character
        to reconstruct events normally.

        Potent memories linger in the flesh, even after death.
        This Charm allows an Abyssal to extract those memories,
        partially animating a corpse or disembodied head to answer
        her questions. Cadavers ensorcelled by this Charm
        open their mouths and speak in whispering monotones but
        have no personality of their own. Although corpses cannot
        lie, either directly or by significant omission, their memories
        rot along with their flesh. For every full week a body has
        been dead, its Intelligence is reduced by one dot, to a
        minimum rating of 1. Corpses can only understand and
        speak languages known in life and remain silent if asked
        questions they do not understand. Unearthed skulls can
        barely whisper “yes” or “no” to the simplest queries, while
        freshly slain cadavers may answer virtually any question
        put to them. Magic that forestalls physical rot also pre-
        serves the Intelligence of a corpse.

        Important or emotionally charged events leave a psychic
        imprint on the location and objects involved. Such
        imprints can last for years or even centuries, depending on
        their potency. By touching such a marked place or object
        and attuning his mind to its passion, an Abyssal with this
        Charm may induce a vivid flashback of the events leading
        to the imprint . If the scrutinized object has multiple
        associations, the strongest passion usually prevails — but
        not always. Visions triggered by this Charm affect all senses
        — in effect, the character is mentally transported to the
        time and place of the imprinted passion. Though flashbacks
        only last a few seconds in reality, they can appear to take
        minutes or even hours depending on their content and
        intensity. Visions are always colored by their dominant
        passion. A violent murder scene may have a slight red tint
        or a frenetic jerkiness. Similarly, a couple shown at their
        wedding might appear softer and more beautiful — almost
        ethereal. In no case can a character take any action in a
        vision or even choose his vantage point.&lt;br&gt;
        As an optional rule, a Storyteller can trigger this
        Charm reflexively whenever a character touches an object
        sufficiently charged with emotional energy. In such cases,
        the Essence cost remains the same, but the Willpower
        requirement is waived since the resulting vision is not an
        act of will. Such flashbacks should enhance mood and
        move a plot forward. They should never be used frivolously
        or as an excuse to drain a character’s Essence.

        damage of 2L for each mote of Essence spent. Against Fair
        Folk and creatures of the Wyld, Crypt Bolt inflicts aggravated

        The character extends his arm, and a bolt of coruscating
        energy flies from his fingertips. If this bolt strikes a being
        with an Essence pool, it envelops her in ribbons of black
        lightning and drains her energy. Although it inflicts no
        damage, Essence-Scattering Blast otherwise follows the
        same rules as Crypt Bolt with regards to its Range, Accuracy
        and roll to hit. Victims struck by this attack lose 1 mote of
        Essence for every mote spent activating this Charm, plus a
        number of additional motes equal to the Exalt’s permanent
        Essence. If applicable, victims always lose Peripheral Essence
        before Personal Essence. This Charm dissipates
        harmlessly if it hits anything besides a magical being,
        including unExalted mortals. A character cannot spend
        more motes on this Charm than his Stamina + Lore.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal may feed on a target’s
        life force directly without even touching her. The player
        rolls Willpower. Each success inflicts one die of lethal
        damage that can only be soaked with Stamina. For every
        level of damage actually inflicted, the Abyssal regains 1
        mote of Essence. This Charm can also target the Essence
        pool of a magical being, with successes draining
        motes directly on a one-for-one basis. So long as the
        Exalt drains fewer motes than a target’s Stamina, she
        may not even notice the loss — attributing the sudden
        weakness to some other cause. However, Essence drained
        from another magical being’s pool glimmers in the air as
        it flows out of the victim’s mouth and into the Abyssal’s
        own. This Charm can target any being in the
        deathknight’s line of sight.

        By forcing death Essence into the land around her, the
        deathknight can destroy all the plant life in the vicinity
        and seriously damage the creatures that live there. The
        Abyssal’s player rolls Charisma + Lore. All plants within
        a circular area with radius equal to the number of successes
        rolled in yards wither and die. All animals and people
        within that radius, including other Exalted, suffer dice of
        lethal damage equal to the character’s permanent Essence.
        The damage from this Charm is soaked only with the
        character’s natural soak.

        Whereas the Wyld embodies growth and untamed
        possibility, the Underworld represents death and ultimate
        stagnation. As such, Abyssal Exalted with this
        Charm can channel their death-tainted Essence to shield
        them from the warping effects of Wyld energies. With
        this Charm invoked, the character and her possessions
        (an amount that can equal a fully laden horse if mounted)
        can venture in the most chaotic regions of the Wyld
        without suffering any change of form. Additionally, the
        character can add her permanent Essence to her soak
        (and other applicable rolls) to resist greater Fair Folk
        magic. Wyld Shield Meditation lasts as long as the Exalt
        desires, although each hour that the user maintains it
        inflicts one level of unsoakable bashing damage to her.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal may unleash the full
        force of the Underworld against the twin enemies of life
        and Wyld. This blast erupts as a spherical shockwave from
        the deathknight, withering trees and eroding rocks even as
        it sucks color and life from the landscape. The Abyssal’s
        player rolls Intelligence + Lore + Essence. All Fair Folk
        and Wyld-spawned mutants in the area of effect suffer
        levels of unsoakable aggravated damage equal to the number
        of successes rolled. Fae slain by this Charm disintegrate
        outright, the glamour of their bodies evaporating under
        the onslaught of necrotic energy. Living beings inside the
        blast zone suffer dice of lethal damage equal to the Abyssal’s
        Lore rating. This burst extends to a radius of (the character’s
        permanent Essence x 10) yards. Once this Charm has been
        used on an area, nothing will grow within the barren circle
        for months —or even years.

        By examining a patient and noting his symptoms, a
        character with this Charm can unerringly diagnose any
        physical illness with which she is familiar. Characters can
        also attempt to diagnose mental illness with this Charm,
        but this requires 30 minutes of examination and a successful
        Perception + Medicine roll. This Charm does not
        improve a character’s actual medical knowledge, only her
        ability to recognize and correctly discern known ailments.
        If a character has never encountered or heard of a disease,
        she can only diagnose its general type and ascertain whether
        it is magical or not. Characters can diagnose their own
        physical diseases with this Charm, although they cannot
        objectively evaluate their own mental health.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Disease is one of the doors to the Underworld. This
        Charm allows an Abyssal to open that door somewhat,
        temporarily infecting the target with a malady. When he
        purchases this Charm, a character must choose the type of
        illness he can inflict. Characters may purchase this Charm
        more than once in order to spread different forms of
        disease. In all forms, the character must be within three
        yards of his intended victim in order to infect her.
        The effects of each permutation are detailed below:&lt;br&gt;
        Body: The Abyssal’s player chooses one of the plagues
        listed in the Exalted rulebook (pp. 319-321) and makes an
        Intelligence + Medicine roll with a difficulty equal to (the
        disease’s Virulence - 1, minimum 1). If the roll is successful,
        the target must succeed on a Stamina + Resistance roll
        to resist infection, just as if exposed to the disease in
        question. The illness is noncommunicable.&lt;br&gt;
        Mind: The Abyssal’s player chooses one of the derangements
        listed in the Exalted rulebook (p. 281) and
        makes a Manipulation + Medicine roll (difficulty 3). If this
        roll is successful, the target succumbs to the chosen form of
        madness unless her player makes a successful Willpower
        roll against a difficulty of the Abyssal’s permanent Essence.
        Derangements induced by this Charm last a number of
        days equal to the Exalt’s Manipulation rating. The actual
        game effects of madness are left to Storytellers to decide.&lt;br&gt;
        Spirit: The Abyssal’s player makes a Conviction +
        Medicine roll, resisted by his intended victim’s Valor +
        Essence. If the Exalt wins, the target immediately falls prey
        to soul-numbing despair. Afflicted characters cannot re-
        gain lost Willpower and suffer a -2 penalty to all dice pools.
        This depression is not a derangement, but a form of soul
        rot. As such, the infection cannot be cured through
        mundane means or magical remedies that target mental
        illness. Once per day, players of infected characters can roll
        Willpower against a difficulty of the Abyssal’s permanent
        Essence. If successful, the character’s soul recovers, and her
        despair lifts. Ordinary mortals infected with despair for
        more days than their Valor rating commit suicide. Characters
        cannot learn Contamination of Spirit until they have
        mastered the other two forms of this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm duplicates the effects of Contamination
        of Body with two notable exceptions. First, plagues created
        with this Charm are more deadly and resistant to medica-
        tion, adding +1 to the difficulty of any Endurance,
        Resistance or Medicine-related roll to fight off or treat the
        disease. In addition, such plagues are just that — plagues
        — and may be spread to other victims by all the usual
        vectors for the disease. The effects persist until the Abyssal
        removes the Essence committed to the Charm. After that
        point, the disease ceases to be contagious. Although
        Abyssals are immune to diseases they personally create,
        their fellows and allies are not, so they must be careful in
        the use of this Charm: Plague does not distinguish between
        friend and foe.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can expunge the corruption
        of disease from his flesh or the flesh of another. All it
        takes is a moment of concentration and a touch, and the
        excised taint bursts from the patient’s body as a viscous
        sludge. The subject is immediately cured of all infected
        wounds, as well as all diseases whose Difficulty to Treat is
        less than or equal to the Exalt’s Medicine rating. This
        Charm can even cure the Great Contagion. Unfortunately,
        the violent expulsion of taint is quite traumatic —
        cured characters suffer a number of levels of lethal damage
        equal to the Untreated Morbidity of their worst disease.
        This damage can only be soaked with Stamina, assuming
        the patient can soak lethal damage at all.

        When the Great Contagion swept across Creation,
        only one in ten survived. Unsurpassed Plague Kiss allows
        an Abyssal to unleash this greatest of weapons with a
        simple touch — albeit a weaker, noncommunicable strain.
        In order to avoid contracting the Contagion, the victim’s
        player must make a reflexive Stamina + Resistance roll at
        difficulty 5. If this roll fails, the player must then roll one
        die to see if his character is blessed with natural immunity.
        If the number rolled is less than or equal to the
        victim’s permanent Essence, she survives with only minor
        fever. Otherwise, the character dies painfully after a
        number of days equal to her Stamina. Characters that
        survive infection are thereafter immune to all strains of
        the Great Contagion.

        Death is often a welcome release from suffering. With
        this Charm, an Abyssal can grant that release to a willing
        individual. The Exalt need only lay his hands on the subject
        and whisper a prayer of dedication to the Malfeans. If the
        patient truly wishes to die, she may spend a point of
        Willpower to painlessly end her own life. This decision
        cannot be coerced in any way, or the Charm fails. Subjects
        of this Charm never rise as hungry ghosts, although they are
        no more or less likely to linger as actual ghosts. Characters
        cannot use this Charm to facilitate their own suicide.

        Though Exalted seldom have to worry about bleeding
        to death, the Chosen can still be overcome by blood
        loss. Once she masters this Charm, however, an Abyssal
        transcends this limitation. She can reflexively stanch her
        wounds without a roll, even while unconscious. Flesh
        contracts and pulls tight, hungrily reabsorbing any blood
        spilled by the original trauma. Within instants, the injury
        seals completely. Blood Mastery Technique does not
        speed healing — it only prevents additional damage from
        bleeding. This Charm cannot mitigate Abyssal Caste
        Mark stigmata.

        Charm can aim her blows at an enemy’s arteries. In addition
        to inflicting normal damage, lethal attacks augmented with
        Crimson Waterfall Attack bleed profusely. All rolls to
        stanch the victim’s bleeding have their difficulty increased
        by (the Abyssal’s permanent Essence rating - the target’s
        permanent Essence rating). Victims of this Charm also
        bleed more quickly, suffering one health level of unsoakable
        lethal damage every minute. Characters with Blood Mastery
        Technique or similar magic are immune to this Charm.
        Crimson Waterfall Attack is explicitly permitted to be part

        This Charm allows an Abyssal to infuse a target with
        corrosive entropy. For a full day, the target heals all injuries
        at one-tenth her normal rate. If the target has magic
        increasing her healing speed, apply the reduction to her
        new rating. For example, Solar Exalted employing Body-Mending
        Meditation recover at their normal rate if cursed
        with this Charm — their 10x bonus canceled by the one-tenth
        penalty. This Charm does not inhibit magic that
        directly restores health levels. Once this Charm’s duration
        expires, the target begins to heal any remaining wounds
        normally with no lingering ill effects. Only one application
        of this Charm can affect a given target at a time.
        Winter Strikes the Forest can augment a hand-to-hand
        attack or be delivered through any other form of touch.
        However, characters can only use this Charm once per
        turn. This Charm is explicitly permitted to be part of a
        Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can channel Essence
        into his wounds, drawing them closed with force of will.
        Use of this Charm leaves discolored bruises in place of
        deep gashes, audibly sets broken bones in place and
        otherwise transforms serious injury into minor inconvenience.
        For every 2 motes spent, the character can
        convert one level of lethal damage into a bashing wound
        level. Characters with a permanent Essence of 3 or higher
        can also use this Charm to heal others, although such
        healing is invariably quite painful. UnExalted characters
        treated by this Charm lose a number of Willpower points
        equal to the number of lethal levels converted unless they
        are unconscious or anesthetized.

        This Charm allows the Abyssal to direct a surge of
        eldritch power through his flesh, turning his most grievous
        wounds into lesser cuts and breaks. For every 5 motes
        spent, the character can instantly convert one level of
        aggravated damage into a lethal wound level. Converted
        wounds heal normally unless treated with further magic
        (such as Wound-Absorbing Method).&lt;br&gt;
        Alternately, this Charm can be used to regenerate
        destroyed tissue, amputated limbs, lost eyes, etc. Eyes,
        tongues, hands, feet, mouths full of smashed teeth and
        other lesser maimings are each the equivalent of one
        health level. Lost limbs are the equivalent of two health
        levels. Although regeneration fueled by this Charm is
        continuous and requires no particular effort or rest on the
        part of the Abyssal, such healing is not instantaneous.
        Destroyed tissue takes one hour per health level to regrow.

        Least of all sorcery and still worlds beyond the power
        of the most talented mortal wizards, magic of the First
        Circle sees much use among the deathknights.
        Note that invoking this Charm only enables the
        character to cast a single Terrestrial Circle Sorcery spell.
        The actual spell itself has an Essence cost, often very high,
        that the character must pay to actualize it. This cost is
        listed in the spell’s description. Terrestrial Circle Sorcery

        Easily outstripping the most potent spells of the Dragon-Blooded,
        the magic of the Second Circle is well known in the
        Underworld as a weapon of the Deathlords and their Daybreak
        Caste servants. Other Abyssal Exalted must often coax
        or barter with these entities for power, though the sorcerer-
        kings of the dead are notably reticent to share their secrets.
        Celestial Circle Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.

        Where sorcery manipulates and channels the Essence
        of Creation, its sister art of necromancy binds the dark
        energies of the Underworld. The Essence of death is potent
        but limited in scope. What it lacks in flexibility, however,
        it makes up for in might. Those who delve into the mystical
        lore of the Malfeans to master this Charm can hone will
        and spirit to perform necromancy of the First Circle. Note
        that, as with sorcery, the cost of this Charm only enables
        the character to cast a single Shadowlands Circle spell.
        The actual spell itself has an Essence cost, often very high,

        In true poetic irony, the very death taint that denies
        the Abyssal Exalted access to Solar Circle Sorcery also
        grants them comparable power over the Oblivion they
        serve. Masters of Void Circle Necromancy are thankfully
        rare, but theirs is the power of unmaking, the power that
        would devour all Creation in its hunger — and the
        Underworld as well. Few spells of this potency exist
        outside the personal libraries of the Deathlords; the
        sorcerer-kings of the Underworld zealously hoard such
        mighty lore as they hoard little else. Void Circle Necromancy
        can never be part of a Combo.

        This Charm allows the character to perceive dematerialized
        spirits in her vicinity. Such beings appear as
        translucent specters of their materialized form, although
        ghosts appear more “solid” to the Abyssal than other types
        of spirits. Every 5 motes spent above the Charm’s base cost
        allow the character to project one additional sense into the
        spirit realm. However, even if a character can feel the
        touch of a dematerialized spirit, she cannot actually touch
        it without employing other magic.

        Even in the most verdant forests, the necrotic Essence
        of the Underworld leaks through into Creation in
        wisps and trails. With this potent Charm, an Abyssal can
        perceive these energies directly. Beings and places suffused
        with death glow with their own baleful radiance,
        while objects imbued with living Essence appear shadowed
        or empty. In addition to perceiving dematerialized
        ghosts, the character can identify other Abyssal Exalted
        with a glance and precisely determine the boundaries of
        any shadowland. Deathknights employing this Charm
        can also spot the seething ripples and whorls of Charms
        and sorcery, allowing them to notice most magic without
        a roll. With a successful Intelligence + Occult roll, a
        character can even identify magic (although the difficulty
        increases by 1 if the scrutinized magic does not
        involve death energy).

        &lt;br&gt;
        Charging his hand or weapon with spectral energy,
        the character can make one strike against an immaterial
        spirit. The character’s player must still roll to hit the
        creature normally, although the deathknight may elect to
        attack the spirit’s Essence in lieu of inflicting damage. This
        decision must be made when activating the Charm, before
        rolling the attack. If the Abyssal chooses to drain Essence,
        roll her Conviction + Occult in place of damage, using the
        spirit’s Valor as its soak total. Each level of “damage”
        inflicted in this fashion drains 2 motes of Essence from the
        spirit’s pool and adds it to the character’s own. Drained
        motes that would take a character above her normal
        maximum are still drained but dissipate without benefit to
        the Exalt. If the character uses this Charm to cause actual
        injury, the attack is resolved normally. This Charm confers
        no ability to perceive incorporeal spirits, so characters
        attacking without other magic (such as Spirit Sensing
        Technique) suffer the usual penalty for blind fighting. This
        Charm has no effect on materialized spirits. Corpus-Rending
        Blow is explicitly permitted to be part of a Combo with
        Charms of other Abilities.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows an Abyssal to infuse a single attack
        with the chill of the Void. The character’s blow can strike
        incorporeal spirits. A successful hit inflicts aggravated damage
        and drains Essence as Corpus-Rending Blow (roll
        separately for each form of damage). Spirits slain by such
        attacks are irrevocably destroyed. Against materialized spir-
        its, this Charm allows the Abyssal to drain Essence as above,
        but the attack does not inflict aggravated damage. Materialized
        spirits killed via Soul-Eating Strike eventually
        regenerate. This Charm is explicitly permitted to be part of
        a Combo with Charms of other Abilities. Spirits can sense
        Exalted who know this Charm and fear and loathe them.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Opening himself as a conduit to the Void, the Abyssal
        spreads his arms, and a maelstrom of flickering shadows
        billows out to fill a radius equaling his permanent Essence in
        yards. This effect remains centered on the character for the
        remainder of the scene. While visible in the material world,
        the unnatural storm barely raises a light breeze. However,
        immaterial spirits within the area of effect suffer battering
        cold equivalent to an arctic gale. Against such creatures, this
        Charm inflicts a number of levels of aggravated damage equal
        to the Abyssal’s permanent Essence minus the spirit’s permanent
        Essence. This damage is not rolled. It is simply applied
        each turn unless the spirit has a means of soaking aggravated
        damage. The character regains 2 motes of Essence for every
        level of damage inflicted by the ward, up to his usual maximum.
        Spirits killed by this Charm are sucked into the Void
        and permanently destroyed. Although this Charm cannot
        injure spirits whose Essence rating matches or exceeds the
        character, the ward still discomfits them (adding +1 to the
        difficulty of all actions inside its area of effect). Materialized
        spirits are immune to this Charm. Spirits can sense Exalts who
        knows this Charm and hate them for it.

        Characters may attack on the same turn that they employ
        this Charm but receive no particular bonus for doing so

        expires. Characters under the influence of this Charm are
        virtually weightless and can crudely glide — but not fly — on
        thermals and updrafts with a successful Dexterity + Athletics
        roll at difficulty 2 but must continue to activate the Charm
        from turn to turn, making it an expensive means of extended

        The Abyssal springs into the air, adding deadly momentum
        to her blow as she descends. Her attack is eerily
        quiet and trails shadowy afterimages of the weapon or limb
        used. The character makes her attack normally, but the
        damage is doubled after it is rolled. Characters cannot move
        in the same turn that they invoke Falling Scythe Attack,
        which precludes it from being placed in a Combo with
        Charms that involve or require movement, such as Flickering
        Image Strike. This Charm can be placed in a Combo
        with Spider Pounce Technique in order to extend the range
        of the character’s jumping attack, but this does not further
        increase the strike’s damage. This Charm is explicitly permitted
        to be part of a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        Prerequisite Charms: Autumn Leaf’s Descent, Falling Scythe Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Where he could only glide with Autumn Leaf’s Descent,
        an Abyssal with this Charm can truly — if briefly —
        fly. The character must spend a full turn in concentration as
        he floods his being with Essence. At the end of the turn, he
        is borne aloft on spectral winds and may subsequently fly
        wherever he wishes. These winds cause capes and cloaks to
        billow and flutter, giving the illusion of wings if the character
        is so attired. Characters may keep this Charm active as
        long as they continue to spend 2 motes of Essence each turn,
        but they fall normally once they stop paying this reflexive
        upkeep. All Essence spent on Soaring Raptor Prana remains
        committed until the character ceases flying. While propelled
        by this Charm, Exalts move (Dexterity x 9) yards per
        turn and may attack other aerial combatants normally or
        assault targets on the ground using ranged weapons. Alternately,
        they can swoop and strike as they pass.&lt;br&gt;
        Unless they are swooping, flying characters can only
        be attacked with ranged weapons, by other flying/leaping
        characters or on the initiative count when they strike a
        ground based target in close combat. As usual, characters
        rolling higher than the Abyssal can delay their initiative
        to strike at the necessary moment. Due to the Exalt’s speed,
        individuals other than his target strike him at a -3 dice
        penalty unless wielding a long weapon, such a spear. In
        such cases, the penalty drops to -1. The Exalt’s target may
        attack him normally without penalty so long as she times
        her strike accordingly.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, a character may dramatically increase
        her speed for short dashes. Upon activation, the
        Exalt surges ahead as a muted blur of motion, her features
        obscured in trailing wisps of shadow. She may increase her
        sprinting speed by one factor for every 2 motes spent, up to
        a maximum multiplier of her permanent Essence. For
        example, a character with an Essence rating of 3 can spend
        4 motes to triple her normal sprinting distance for the turn.
        As an additional benefit, characters employing this Charm
        can run without fear of getting winded or weary.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Exalt delivers a single devastating
        blow as he rushes past an opponent. While executing
        this attack, the character is a flickering blur of violence
        and shadow — his motions appear broken as if viewed by
        the light of a pulsing strobe. The character makes his
        attack normally, but the damage he inflicts is doubled after
        it is rolled.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt can move up to his normal sprinting distance
        without penalty on the same turn he activates this
        Charm, although he is not required to do so. He must have
        relative freedom of motion, however, so restrained characters
        cannot use this Charm. Flickering Image Strike is
        explicitly permitted to be part of Combos with Charm of
        other Abilities.

        The character hunches over and stretches at inhuman
        angles, gaining unnatural flexibility and balance for
        as long as he maintains this Charm. The Exalt can scuttle
        or dash along any surface without regard to gravity, allowing
        him to scale sheer walls or dance on a ceiling with equal
        facility. Alternately, the character may stand motionless
        at odd angles or cling to an impossible perch. Storytellers
        should assign bonuses as appropriate. While useful, the
        character’s distended limbs and joints reduce his Appearance
        by 1, to a minimum rating of zero.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt must pay 1 mote each turn he maintains
        this Charm; this expenditure is reflexive and requires no
        concentration. If the character does not pay this upkeep,
        his body returns to its normal configuration, and he once
        again becomes subject to gravity and inertia. All Essence
        spent on Crouching Gargoyle Stance remains committed
        until the Charm expires.

        Stepping with the weightless poise of a ghost, a
        character with this Charm can tread on water and other
        fluid surfaces as easily as solid ground. Her silent footfalls
        leave no ripples or wake, no sign to mark her passage as a
        corporeal being. Although the character can walk on
        dangerous liquids such as corrosive slime and magma
        without sinking, such landscapes inflict normal injury to
        the soles of her feet or shoes.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters must spend 2 motes each turn that they
        maintain Mist Over Ice. This upkeep is reflexive and does
        not require significant effort, but the overall concentration
        necessary to maintain this Charm adds +1 to the
        difficulty of all complex tasks (as decided by the Storyteller).
        If a character fails to pay this upkeep, she sinks
        normally. All Essence spent on this Charm remains com-
        mitted until the Exalt stops using Mist Over Ice.

        Suffusing his flesh and bones with Essence, the
        Abyssal briefly elevates his physical prowess to superhuman
        levels. When he purchases this Charm, the character
        must choose whether to heighten agility or power. This
        choice determines whether the character increases his
        Strength or Dexterity. This Charm cannot be purchased
        again, so the character must decide if he wishes to focus
        on Strength or Dexterity.
        For every 3 motes spent, the character raises his
        Strength by one dot. For every 5 motes spent, the
        character increases his Dexterity by one dot. The character
        cannot increase an Attribute by more that his
        permanent Essence rating.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal can sap an enemy’s
        vigor and leave him briefly enfeebled. The character
        gestures to any living target within five yards, and a wave
        of smothering Essence leaps from her fingers. Her player
        makes a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to the
        target’s permanent Essence. If the roll is successful, the
        victim loses 1 dot of Strength for every 3 motes spent.&lt;br&gt;
        Exalted targets (and other beings capable of channeling
        Essence) cannot have their Strength reduced below their
        permanent Essence with this Charm. Additionally, magical
        victims can cancel their weakness by spending 5 motes per
        dot, although such resistance requires concentration and
        counts as a dice action. This Charm has no effect on targets
        whose permanent Essence is higher than the Abyssal’s.&lt;br&gt;
        Non-magical targets are not so lucky, however. If
        their Strength is reduced to zero, they remain at Strength
        1 for the rest of the scene, but they also lose a permanent
        dot of Strength that can only be recovered with experi-
        ence. This Charm cannot permanently reduce a victim’s
        Strength below 1.

        Prerequisite Charms: Infirmity Inflicting Gesture&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal can rob a living victim of
        her potency and add it to his own might. The character must
        successfully strike his target in hand-to-hand combat. Regardless
        of whether the attack inflicts damage, the Abyssal’s
        player makes a Willpower roll against the target’s permanent
        Essence. If the Abyssal’s player wins, the victim loses 1 dot of
        Strength for every 4 motes the Abyssal spent (according to
        the same rules as Infirmity Inflicting Gesture). In addition,
        the character gains 1 dot of Strength for every 2 dots temporarily
        taken. This bonus lasts for the rest of the scene.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt gains no Strength for reducing a mortal’s
        rating and cannot more than double his unmodified
        Strength with this Charm. Victims regain all lost Strength
        at the end of the scene unless their rating has been
        permanently reduced. This Charm is explicitly permitted
        to be part of a Combo with Charms of other Abilities. As
        with Infirmity Inflicting Gesture, mortal crippled by the
        Charm cannot recover except by spending experience.

        Guiding and expanding his perception with a rush
        of Essence, a character with this Charm experiences
        every sensation magnified fivefold. Colors are deeper
        and richer, sounds more melodic or discordant, and
        scents somehow fuller and yet subtler at once. The
        world is achingly beautiful to the Abyssal, a painful
        realization indeed for those chosen to extinguish that
        beauty and drown it in the Void. In addition to adding
        his Essence to all Awareness rolls, the character employing
        this Charm can differentiate sensations far
        more readily than any mortal. It is incumbent upon the
        Storyteller to relay information accordingly. Characters
        using this Charm are no more susceptible to sensory
        overload than normal.

        With a savage clawing motion, a character who

        sight and dull his awareness. The Abyssal’s player rolls
        Manipulation + Awareness against a difficulty of the
        target’s permanent Essence. Each success allows the
        Abyssal to reduce all the target’s Awareness dice pools by
        one die for the duration of the Charm. This Charm
        cannot reduce a victim’s dice pool lower than his Essence
        score. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this penalty may
        also apply to other tasks requiring precise sensory acuity,
        such as Archery attacks. The Essence cost of this Charm
        must be paid prior to the activation roll.

        The character gains a “sixth sense” that warns her

        require no roll, but the accompanying wave of horror
        drains 1 mote from the Abyssal. Experiencing a premonition
        does not count as a Charm use, allowing the character
        to freely invoke other Charms on the same turn he receives
        a warning, but Ominous Portent Method cannot be placed
        in a Combo. The character’s prescience warns her of any
        physical threat, from a concealed pit of spikes to an
        assassin’s knife, but the Charm is not infallible and does
        nothing to warn of purely spiritual or mental danger.

        Once an Abyssal purchases this Charm, he can thereafter
        see in darkness without penalty. His enhanced vision
        pierces all shades of gloom, from moonlit night to the utter
        blackness of the Labyrinth. However, this modification
        also makes the character sensitive to bright light. Under
        lighting comparable to the noonday sun or within close
        proximity to a torch, the Abyssal suffers the penalty for
        murky vision. The Exalt can suppress or reactivate his
        night vision at will to avoid this problem, but each change
        takes one full turn and costs 1 mote. This change counts as
        a Charm, cannot be placed in a Combo and leaves the
        character totally blind (-4 dice to attacks) during the turn
        it happens. This Charm does not allow the character to see
        more easily through fog or smoke, nor does it help him
        perceive invisible objects or people.

        The Exalted channels Essence through his body and
        movements, making him extremely difficult to strike. For
        every mote spent, the Abyssal reduces the dice pool of a
        single attack by two dice. This Charm can only target
        attacks aimed specifically at the Exalt and may reduce a
        dice pool to zero (ensuring that the attack misses). Characters
        may activate this Charm any time after an attack is
        declared but before dice are rolled. Flitting Shadow Form
        can only target attacks the Exalt is aware of.

        Whenever a character with this Charm is attacked,
        she feels a sense of impending dread and may attempt to
        sidestep an unseen blow on impulse alone. The character’s
        dice pool for such a dodge equals her unmodified Dexterity.
        This Charm cannot be placed in a Combo with other
        Dodge Charms. If a deathknight’s player does not choose
        to activate this Charm in response to an unseen attack, the
        Exalt does not sense the blow until it lands. This Charm
        must be activated prior to the attack roll.

        Moving faster than the shadows cast by a guttering
        candle, the Abyssal may evade blows with supernatural
        prowess. The attacker loses a number of dice from a single
        attack roll equal to the deathknight’s Dodge + Essence.
        If this reduces an attack dice pool to zero, the blow
        automatically misses. This Charm must be activated
        prior to the attack roll.

        The Abyssal ripples and vanishes like smoke in a stiff
        breeze, coalescing a split second later a short distance
        away. This Charm allows the Abyssal to perfectly dodge
        any one attack that he can perceive without a roll,
        including those with an area effect. The character still
        cannot dodge magical effects that explicitly prohibit
        dodging, however. The character may not move more
        yards with this technique than his permanent Essence
        rating and cannot use the Charm to teleport through
        solid barriers. Flickering Wisp Technique must be activated
        prior to the attack roll.

        In addition to teleporting out of harm’s way, an
        Abyssal with this Charm can ensure that she materializes
        behind her opponent. Flowing Evasion Assault follows the
        same rules as Flickering Wisp Technique with two exceptions.
        First, the Exalt may reappear as far away as her Dodge
        in yards. Secondly, if the attacker is within this range, the
        Abyssal may automatically reappear behind her opponent.
        If the Abyssal has any actions remaining to launch an
        attack of her own, she gains the full benefits of attacking
        from behind (see Exalted, p. 238).

        &lt;br&gt;
        By stealing a victim’s Essence, a character with this
        Charm can also steal her visage. The player of the Abyssal
        makes an Intelligence + Larceny roll after her character
        consumes 1 or more motes of Essence from her target by
        means of blood drinking or magic. The difficulty is 6 minus
        the total number of motes taken. If a character drains a
        victim entirely of blood or consumes all her flesh, the
        difficulty is automatically 1. Successes on this roll count as
        a mundane impersonation attempt (see Exalted, p. 255),
        except that the Abyssal’s features actually shift to resemble
        the victim’s. Players of characters attempting to pierce the
        ruse may roll Perception + Awareness against a difficulty
        of the deathknight’s successes. Note that the Exalt only
        takes on the appearance of his target — the Charm does
        not bestow knowledge of mannerisms. Characters who
        know the target personally can quickly recognize the Exalt
        as an imposter simply by interacting with him. This Charm
        can only be used to impersonate humans.

        This Charm duplicates the effects of Theft of Face
        with one exception: The Exalt also steals intuitive knowl-
        edge of her victim’s mannerisms and habits. Consequently,
        the ruse is much more effective and can easily fool casual
        associates of the target. Close family members can still
        recognize that something is wrong, however, regardless of
        whether they actually suspect an imposter or attribute the
        odd behavior to illness.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal may consume the flesh
        and spirit of a victim to steal her very identity. The
        character must completely drain her victim of blood and
        spend one hour digesting and studying the stolen Essence.
        At the conclusion of her meditation, the Exalt
        shifts into the perfect likeness of her victim. This is not
        an illusion, however, but a startling transformation.
        Every mark and scar is duplicated, every tic and mannerism
        compensated for.&lt;br&gt;
        If questioned, the Exalt can even draw on the stolen
        memories of her prey with an Intelligence + Larceny roll
        at a difficulty assigned by the Storyteller. No amount of
        physical scrutiny can discern that the Abyssal is not whom
        she pretends to be, although any display of an Abyssal
        anima banner may spoil the effect. This Charm only
        permits impersonation of human victims who are the same
        gender as the Exalt. Although she may disguise herself as
        an Exalted victim and even duplicate elemental aspect
        markings or Lunar scarring, the character cannot emulate
        the powers or anima of her stolen visage. Once the character
        voluntarily ends this Charm, she loses all memories
        and shifts back to her true form. Death also ends the ruse.
        Characters can only assume a given guise once before the
        memories are digested.

        By channeling the nascent spark of Solar Essence
        trapped within her, an Abyssal with this Charm can shift
        her anima to resemble that of a Chosen of the Unconquered Sun.
        While this Charm is in effect, the deathknight’s
        anima banner and Caste Mark manifests exactly as a Solar
        of the appropriate type (Dusk become Dawn, Midnight
        becomes Zenith, etc.). This Charm only affects the anima
        banner, however. The Exalt retains the anima power appropriate
        to his true Caste. Any Zenith Caste Solar with a
        Permanent Essence higher than the Abyssal’s can see
        through the disguise. Only Abyssal Exalted can learn this
        Charm, although it is rumored that some Solars of the
        Night Caste may have developed a similar technique for
        impersonating deathknights.

        Many criminals live short bloody lives and die just as
        bleakly. Accordingly, an Abyssal who taps into the web of
        shared regrets and suffering of the criminal dead has a
        wealth of information at his disposal. He can intuitively
        pick out criminal establishments from honest businesses
        and discern those who actively desire to sell or buy illegal
        merchandise. Just as easily, the Abyssal can spot the lines
        of power in the local crime scene and track them back to
        the true crime-lords of the area. While this Charm remains
        active, the character is at home in any criminal subculture.
        Cunning Criminal Style cannot discern informers or undercover
        agents from ordinary criminals unless there are
        sufficient clues present to draw such a conclusion.

        clues or leave physical evidence such as footprints, hair,
        etc. Obviously, if an Abyssal wants to leave clues, she may
        do so, since the Charm only protects against unintentional
        evidence. Only supernatural tracking can find a character
        shrouded with this Charm.

        such as actually summoning a coin from a belt pouch

        Dexterity + Larceny roll. This Charm is intended for
        trickery and bedazzlement, not combat. Instantly palming
        a handful of shuriken is permissible, but the character
        cannot actually create something from nothing, nor
        steal possessions from an opponent. The Storyteller
        retains final say on what can and cannot be done with
        this Charm.

        object in his direct line of sight. The targeted object
        flickers and vanishes, rematerializing from Elsewhere in
        the character’s grasp. This Charm can only grab objects
        small enough to comfortably hold with one hand and may
        not take possessions out of a sentient being’s grasp. Possessions
        on a person’s body can be swiped but not if they are
        securely fastened. A money pouch could be grabbed but
        not the belt it was affixed to, for example. Ultimately, the
        Storyteller retains final say on what can or cannot be taken
        with this Charm.

        Briefly eroding the attention span of onlookers
        with a gentle rush of Essence, an Abyssal with this
        Charm becomes far more difficult to notice. Until the
        end of the scene, all attempts to spot the Exalt increase
        their difficulty by his permanent Essence. This increase
        applies only so long as the Abyssal does not
        draw undue attention to himself and remains unnoticed.
        Once he is spotted by anyone, the Charm
        immediately ends and cannot be reactivated until the

        Despite their prowess, even the most stealthy and
        nimble Day Castes get caught from time to time. With this
        Charm, a character can rip the memory of an encounter
        from a target’s mind so that he forgets he ever saw the
        Exalt. The Abyssal’s player rolls Manipulation + Stealth
        against a difficulty of the target’s Essence (or highest
        Essence in the case of a group). For every success rolled, the
        target forgets the events of one turn. Thus, four successes
        erase the past four turns of a target’s memory. As an added
        benefit, a befuddled target will not notice the Abyssal
        again for a like number of turns unless she draws attention
        to herself. This gives the Exalt a few seconds to escape and
        conceal herself more thoroughly. This Charm has no effect
        on beings with a higher permanent Essence than the
        Abyssal or against beings who are physically agitated (for
        example, those in combat).

        Enveloped in the stillness of the grave, an Abyssal
        with this Charm active makes no noise whatsoever. Her
        footsteps do not echo or splash — she can jump or stomp
        or shout in perfect eerie silence. Conversely, she cannot
        speak or employ any magic that relies on sound. This
        Charm only wards against sounds made by the character,
        however. Her blade might slide soundlessly through a
        victim’s ribs, but the effect would not muffle the victim’s
        scream of pain or rasping death rattle.

        of the turn, the target cannot speak or make any other
        vocalized noise. Day Caste assassins often employ this
        Charm to prevent their victims from screaming. This
        Charm has no effect on beings with a higher permanent
        Essence than the Exalt.

        he adds 1 die per 2 motes spent to all Stealth rolls.
        The Exalt cannot purchase more dice with this Charm
        than equal to twice his Essence rating. If a bright light is
        shined on the hidden Exalt, his cloak dissolves immediately,
        and the Charm ends.

        The Abyssal vanishes wholly from sight, dissolving in
        a ripple of scattering shadows. For a number of turns equal
        to half the number of motes invested, the Exalt is visible as
        nothing more than a wavering in the air. Ranged attacks
        against her are all but impossible without magical aid or
        well-described stunts, while close-range attacks suffer a
        difficulty penalty of the deathknight’s permanent Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through this Charm, an Abyssal can momentarily
        confuse a target and weaken her effectiveness in a critical
        moment. For every mote spent, the target loses one die
        from a single Bureaucracy roll. This Charm cannot reduce
        a victim’s dice pool lower than her Essence, however.
        Authority-Eroding Technique may be invoked any time
        after an appropriate action is declared but before dice are
        rolled. The Abyssal can even set up the targeted roll, such
        as by asking a pointed question in a meeting.

        By speaking brusquely and projecting an aura of
        menace, an Abyssal with this Charm can cut through the
        drawn-out process of debate. The targeted argument ends
        within moments with the best resolution that the Exalt
        could have achieved with continued discussion. For ex-
        ample, a character could use this Charm to derive the best
        price from a merchant, saving minutes or perhaps even
        hours of haggling. Note that Argument-Slaying Remark
        isn’t a perfect “final word” Charm—if an answer would be
        no regardless of what the Abyssal might say or argue, then
        the answer remains no. This Charm simply brings the
        matter to a conclusion instantly.

        opponents find it difficult or even impossible to argue. The
        Abyssal’s player makes the Bureaucracy or Performance
        roll as normal, but all rivals add the deathknight’s Essence
        rating to the difficulty of their counterarguments.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can perceive corrupt
        officials and bureaucrats by a distinctive oily stain on their
        aura. Alternately, she can intuitively gauge a “clean”
        official’s susceptibility to corruption. Her player rolls Perception
        + Bureaucracy against a difficulty of the target’s
        Essence score. The amount of information gleaned depends
        on the number of successes rolled.&lt;br&gt;
        Simple success allows the Abyssal to sense whether
        the target has ever engaged in corruption or not (i.e.,
        accepted a bribe, doctored a report, etc.). With three
        successes, the character can measure the depth of a target’s
        corruption or her overall vulnerability to such. Thus, she
        can distinguish the minor blotches of a plagiarizing poet
        from the inky coils of a politician who secretly assassinated
        his rivals. With five successes, the Abyssal gains a vague
        sense of the target’s offenses, though not the context or
        specifics. This hunch enables the deathknight to take
        advantage of an official’s hidden weakness or vice — or
        simply to know whom best to bribe.

        With a few artfully placed rumors and whispers, an
        Abyssal with this Charm can sow the seeds of discord and
        mistrust within a particular bureau or organization. Tem-
        pers flare, growing mistrust leads to outright hostility and
        factionalism; the bureau steadily grinds to a halt and
        implodes under the weight of indolence and excess. This
        Charm can fully affect a department whose total mem-
        bership is no greater than (the deathknight’s Essence
        rating x 20). If the character wishes to affect a larger
        organization, he must use this Charm multiple times or
        settle for a slower, lesser effect as the magic strikes
        randomly. Regardless, it takes time for infighting and
        paranoia to build to an extent that it actually impedes
        efficiency. While this is left to Storytellers to adjudicate,
        the overall corruption and rivalry or lack thereof plays a
        significant role, as does the quality and strength of
        leadership within the organization. Generally, this Charm
        is beyond the scope of rules and has little tangible effect.
        Its intangible effects can be quite dramatic, however. Few
        organizations of mortals can withstand more than a
        month of this Charm without utterly disintegrating.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm closely parallels Cunning Subversion
        Style. Rather than targeting an organization, however, the
        Abyssal may focus the havoc against a specific leader. Even
        if there is no actual coup or assassination attempt —
        though there might well be — the concomitant treachery
        and distrust makes all but the most tyrannical despot
        utterly ineffective. The victim’s orders are twisted or
        disregarded by subordinates, while overall morale drops to
        an all-time low. Each application of this Charm may affect
        a number of people equal to the character’s Essence rating
        x 20. As with Cunning Subversion Style, this Charm is
        primarily a matter of roleplaying rather than rules. Still, it
        is unlikely that any mortal leader can last more than a
        month with a hierarchy that hates and mistrusts him.
        Whether he is pushed out of office or stabbed to death in
        an alley depends very much on the character and nature of
        the victim’s subordinates and the type of organization.
        Ironically, true tyrants have little to fear from this Charm,
        as they already know how to retain authority in the face of
        negative popular opinion.

        Exuding menace and prowess in equal measure, an
        Abyssal can enchant his very authority to sow fear and
        discourage rebellion. The character must have some
        recognized leadership position in order to use this Charm,
        although the type and scope of leadership doesn’t mat-
        ter. A caravan master can surpass a king in brutal
        tyranny. While this Charm is active, no one with a
        Willpower score lower than the character’s Essence can
        bring herself to consider disobedience, let alone partici-
        pate in outright rebellion.
        Individuals with a Willpower rating equal to the
        character’s Willpower may act against the despot, but their
        players suffer a difficulty increase of the deathknight’s
        permanent Essence on all Social rolls to rally others to the
        cause. Characters whose Willpower exceeds the Abyssal’s
        are immune to this Charm, as are all magical beings. Also,
        this Charm only affects members of the hierarchy over
        which the Exalt presides. A great monarch could order any
        subject about but would have no authority over a foreign
        citizen. Storyteller discretion is particularly important in
        preventing abuse of this Charm. Of course, a large sphere
        of influence carries its own risks. Besides the increased
        likelihood that a strong-willed champion will organize a
        coup, infamous dictators may attract jealous rivals who
        wish to usurp their power.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal may absorb a victim’s
        knowledge of language even as he devours her Essence.
        The character must have consumed at least 1 mote from
        the target sometime during the scene — whether through
        blood drinking, Charms, etc. His player then rolls Wits +
        Linguistics, with a difficulty of (5 - the total number of
        motes taken). If this lowers the difficulty below one, no roll
        is needed. If the roll succeeds, the Abyssal instantly learns
        one language of his choice known to the target. This
        knowledge is absolute — the deathknight speaks with
        perfect fluency and no trace of accent and may read and
        write in the tongue so long as the target knew how to do so.
        If the character consumes more than 5 motes, he may also
        spend double the requisite experience point cost to digest
        the stolen knowledge and permanently increase his Linguistics
        rating on the spot. Otherwise, languages absorbed
        with this Charm fade completely when the Charm expires.

        As the warrior-poets of the Underworld, many Abyssal
        Exalted speak and write with haunting skill and
        eloquence. For every mote spent on this Charm, the
        character may add one die to all Linguistics rolls for a
        specific known language. These dice are mechanically
        identical to a Linguistics specialty (see Exalted, p. 140)
        and may similarly add to other communication-related
        rolls, at Storyteller discretion. The character cannot purchase
        more bonus dice for any language than her
        Intelligence score. Note that characters with four or more
        dice of fluency convey superhuman grace, as is immediately
        evident to any listener or reader. Indeed, slow-witted

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can temporarily excise
        a victim’s comprehension of a particular language. The
        Exalt whispers softly in the maddening dialect of the
        Malfeans and indicates a target within line of sight. His
        player then rolls Manipulation + Linguistics against a
        difficulty of the target’s permanent Essence. For every
        success rolled, the character may spend 5 motes to remove
        a random language or pick a language known the Abyssal
        and suppress it. The latter is a gamble, however, unless the
        Exalt is certain his target knows the language in question.
        Individuals deprived of all languages cannot speak or write
        at all, although they may attempt to grunt and crudely
        pantomime their intentions. Once the duration ends, the
        target regains full memory of all her forgotten languages.
        This Charm has no effect on beings with a higher permanent
        Essence than the Exalt.

        Cursing sharply in the lost tongue of the Malfeans,
        the Abyssal distorts all communication in a zone around
        her person. No one inside this area of effect can
        understand written or spoken language. Familiar letters
        run together into baffling glyphs, while every
        spoken phrase twists into complete gibberish. Clever
        characters may communicate simple concepts with
        pantomime or crude drawings, but formal or established
        hand signs convey no more meaning than any
        spoken tongue. The character makes a Manipulation +
        Linguistics roll against the targets, with a difficulty
        equal to the targets’ highest permanent Essence. This
        Charm has no effect on characters whose permanent
        Essence matches or exceeds the Abyssal’s. However,
        while such beings hear and see languages as they truly
        are, their own words remain twisted to affected beings.

        An Abyssal with this Charm may bypass language
        entirely and communicate telepathically. The character
        must be able to directly sense her target to invoke
        this Charm. If at any time the Exalt cannot perceive
        her target, the connection instantly breaks, and the
        Charm ends. While the link remains, however, the
        Abyssal can project her thoughts at will as a reflexive
        action, enabling her to speak with someone she does
        not share a language with. The target knows the
        thoughts come from outside his mind, although he
        cannot pinpoint their source without other magic
        unless the Exalt identifies herself. Similarly, the target
        may project his own thoughts and replies along the
        link. As with vocalized speech, neither party projects
        information they do not intend to convey — this
        Charm does not allow deeper mind reading or memory
        probing, nor does it preclude deception.

        By channeling Essence-laden blood through his fingertips,
        an Exalt who knows this Charm always has a
        means of writing. As the Abyssal traces glyphs with his
        fingers, his touch leaves runes of indelible crimson.
        Marks etched with this Charm are virtually indistinguishable
        from ink stains and can be cleaned or removed
        as such if the writing surface permits. It is far easier to
        scrub stone than paper, after all. If used to mark living
        beings, the glyphs resemble tattoos, but gradually fade
        over a period or days or weeks like any applied dye.
        Characters using this Charm write with uncanny precision,
        easily matching the graceful calligraphy of even a
        very fine stylus or brush.

        By tracing a mystical blood rune on a target’s forehead,
        an Abyssal with this Charm may protect an individual from
        hungry ghosts and walking dead. The mark cannot be
        washed off and retains a slick appearance even after it dries.
        For the duration of the Charm, no zombie or bestial ghost
        will attack the target unless compelled to do so by a necro-
        mancer, an Abyssal, a ghost using Arcanoi or some other
        supernatural compulsion. Sentient ghosts generally leave
        the character alone out of fear of the Deathlords but are not
        compelled to do so. This Charm can enchant any human,
        including Exalted, but any display of an anima banner or
        Caste Mark burns away the rune and revokes the protection.
        The Abyssal may use the Ghost-Warding Glyph on himself.

        By touching a sample of writing, an Abyssal with this
        Charm can attune his mind to the lingering wisps of
        memory left by the author. The Exalt can read the targeted
        work with perfect fluency, but loses attunement and
        comprehension as soon as he stops reading or reaches the
        end of the document. Note that it is not necessary to read
        in a linear manner: He may skim passages, jump ahead and
        reread sections as many times as desired. However, once
        the Abyssal halts to pursue another task, the Charm end.
        Although an Exalt cannot quote specific passages or recall
        exact wording after the Charm ends, he still remembers
        what he read and what it meant.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not work against artificial languages,
        codes and other such methods of deliberately
        obscuring the content of a work, as the author’s intent is
        devious and the traces left behind are opaque.

        A character using this Charm becomes preternaturally
        resistant to all forms of persuasion, from simple
        argument to outright mind control. For the duration of
        the Charm, the character’s Nature changes to Critic.
        Any time the deathknight is subjected to words or magic
        that would alter his point of view or perceptions, his
        player may reflexively roll Willpower against a difficulty
        of the offending character’s Essence. Success allows the
        Abyssal to scornfully shrug off the suggestion. Characters
        using this Charm are notably brusque and bitter, which
        adds +1 to the difficulty of all Charisma rolls. Scathing
        Cynic Attitude cannot defend against persuasion by
        beings with a higher permanent Essence than the
        character’s Willpower.

        A character with this Charm can subdue a mount
        with his supernatural will. For every mote spent, the
        targeted animal has its Control Rating reduced by one
        point. If this reduces the steed’s Control Rating to zero, it
        obeys unhesitatingly and will jump to its death if so
        directed. Mounts tamed with this Charm only obey the
        Exalt. All other characters must contend with the beast’s
        normal Control Rating. Soul Reins only affects animals
        trained for riding — characters cannot jump on the back
        of a wild tyrant lizard and expect compliance.

        Prerequisite Charms: Soul Reins&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Similar to Soul Reins, this Charm allows a deathknight
        to dominate a steed and subsume its will to her own. Unlike
        the lesser Charm, however, the effects of Mount-Breaking
        Method are permanent. The character’s player rolls Strength
        + Ride against a difficulty of the animal’s Control Rating.
        Each success permanently reduces the mount’s Control
        Rating by one point, to a minimum score of one. If the
        Abyssal’s player actually rolls enough successes to reduce a
        Control Rating to zero, the beast gains immunity to terror
        when ridden by the Exalt. Although the final outcome is a
        foregone conclusion based on the results of the roll, the
        character must still spend the rest of the scene aggressively
        taming her steed. Unless this roll is botched, the Exalt will
        not suffer injury during the training session. This Charm
        actually weakens the spirit of the beast rather than simply
        compelling obedience, so the mount’s new Control Rating
        applies to all riders. Mount-Breaking Method may affect any
        animal that can possibly be trained to accept a rider, even
        dangerous beasts such as hybroc and bear. The character
        must have a permanent Essence of 3 or higher to train exotic
        or deadly animals, however.

        With this Charm, a mounted character can briefly
        sustain and push his horse with raw Essence. Tireless
        Charger Technique lasts until the Abyssal dismounts or a
        number of hours have passed equal to the deathknight’s
        Ride score. Enchanted steeds have boundless energy and
        never need to stop for food or water. However, the necrotic
        Essence powering this Charm also eats at the animal’s life
        force. For every hour or fraction thereof that the Charm is
        maintained, the horse suffers one level of unsoakable
        lethal damage. This damage is deferred until the Charm
        ends. After a horse suffers injury from this Charm, it
        cannot be safely re-enchanted with this Charm until it
        fully heals its wounds. Doing otherwise allows the horse to
        act at full strength again, but immediately kills the mount
        when the forced march ends.

        An Abyssal with this Charm can silently summon her
        mount from great distances. The steed feels the bite of
        phantom spurs digging harshly into its flanks unless it
        moves at best possible speed toward the Exalt. This Charm
        has a range of (the character’s permanent Essence x 10)
        miles. The Abyssal must have clearly exerted dominance
        over the summoned animal at least once before it will
        answer a summons. Such dominance can have been
        achieved through physical (such as through beating or
        rough use of actual spurs) or mystical (as in the case of Soul
        Reins) means. While animals under the influence of this
        Charm never get distracted or become lost, they cannot
        circumvent complex obstacles any better than normal.
        The compulsion and pain inflicted by this Charm remain
        in force until the animal reaches its master or moves
        beyond range.

        With this Charm, a character may summon a ghost
        horse from the Essence of the Underworld. Materializing
        out of dusky smoke, the beast has the appearance of a pure
        black stallion with eyes like smoldering coals and sharp
        teeth no horse alive should have. It has the same statistics
        as a war horse of excellent quality (see Exalted, p. 316), but
        it is utterly tireless, fearless and inflicts 4L with a successful
        bite. Spectral steeds do not need food or drink, but enjoy
        the taste of human flesh and blood. If a character uses this
        Charm again before its duration expires, a new horse
        appears, and the old one dissolves with a screaming whinny.

        the players of their riders or team drivers makes a successful
        Charisma + Ride roll against a difficulty of the shouting
        Abyssal’s Essence. Even if this roll succeeds, affected
        mounts remain skittish and add one to their Control
        Rating for the rest of the scene. This increase is cumulative
        if the Abyssal emits more than one such scream in a scene.
        Mount-Spooking Shout does not terrify the Abyssal’s own
        steed, nor does the Charm have any effect on beasts other
        than pack animals or actual mounts.

        The character momentarily closes his eyes and dredges

        When he opens his eyes, he intuitively understands the
        craft of sailing as though from decades of experience at sea.
        The Exalt adds one dot to his Sail rating for every mote
        spent, although this Charm cannot raise a character’s Sail
        above 5. In addition, Exalted using this Charm never

        perfect balance and may effortlessly stride about the deck
        or scurry up rigging without requiring a roll, even in the
        middle of a howling typhoon or on impact with a submerged
        reef. The rest of the crew may fly overboard from
        the impact or lashing winds, but the Exalt stands eerily

        immune to seasickness.

        Channeling the Essence of the Underworld and his
        own life force, the character may reduce a crew’s need for
        food and rest. The character must spend one point of
        Willpower, plus 1 mote for every four crewmembers or
        fraction thereof that he wishes to enchant. If there are rats
        or other vermin aboard, their life energy is absorbed into
        powering the Charm, reducing the cost to 1 mote per six
        crewmen. This side effect steadily kills off all pests, including
        the inevitable weevils in the ship’s biscuits, which
        most sailors regard as a bad omen. Unless a ship is very large
        or very infested, it takes only two or three applications of
        this Charm to completely eradicate all vermin aboard.&lt;br&gt;
        A sailor ensorcelled with Crew Sustaining Technique
        needs only a quarter of the food, water and rest that she
        normally does. She does not suffer from scurvy or other
        dietary deficiencies from substandard rations and feels
        unusually enervated. Long-term exposure is dangerous,
        however. If this Charm is used on a character for more days
        than her Stamina, each successive day reduces her Stamina
        by one dot. Characters reduced to zero Stamina die. Lost
        Stamina returns at the rate of one point per day. Only after
        a character has fully recovered her Stamina can she be
        safely enchanted again. This Charm has no effect on

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, a character channels Essence to
        patch the rips and tears of a damaged sail and rigging. The
        character concentrates and raises his hand, summoning a
        morass of shadows to spread over the targeted sail. For the
        next 24 hours, the sail behaves as if undamaged and
        provides appropriate propulsion. If a ship has multiple
        sails, the Exalt may have to use this Charm more than
        once. While Phantom Sail Technique can restore clinging
        tatters to full function, it cannot create a sail from nothing.
        At least some identifiable vestiges must remain.

        The Abyssal stands on deck, arms upraised and
        crackling with Essence as she summons a cold wind from
        the Underworld. This wind only exists to propel her
        vessel and displaces all natural breezes for that purpose,
        but otherwise, it does not disturb the water or the wind
        for other ships (though they may hear its eerie howling).
        Ships so enchanted move as though the wind were full in
        their sails, regardless of the prevailing wind’s direction or
        the course set by the helmsman. The spectral wind has
        the same intensity as the winds around it, however, so
        ships sailing in a hurricane must still contend with the
        dangers of such a gale.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, an Abyssal can extend a zone of
        stillness from him, displacing even the fiercest gales
        within its periphery. The Exalt stands on deck and
        concentrates, tracing a horizontal arc with his arms. At
        the conclusion of the gesture, a spherical wave of Essence
        flashes out from the arc to a radius of (the character’s
        permanent Essence x 15) yards. This wave vanishes
        almost immediately, but its magic kills all breezes inside
        its boundary. This artificial stillness moves with the Exalt
        and lasts for one scene or until its creator dies or moves
        more than a yard from his original location on deck. The
        character can still speak and gesture normally while
        maintaining this Charm, however. Wind-Killing Stance
        cannot stop magical breezes or breezes called by magical
        beings unless their creator is substantially less powerful
        than the Abyssal (Storyteller’s discretion). This Charm
        is primarily used to weather storms and to prevent enemy
        sailing vessels from escaping.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By laying hands against a ship and willing Essence to
        flow through its timbers, an Abyssal with this Charm can
        mystically reinforce her vessel. The ship gains 1L soak per
        mote spent, although the deathknight cannot purchase
        more points of soak than his Stamina + Sail. This limit
        applies to all applications of the Charm in a scene. Hull-Hardening
        Technique does not require Willpower if used
        to strengthen a ship while another application the Charm
        remains active. Hulls regularly treated with this Charm
        look bleached and weathered before their time, although
        they retain the durability of their true age.

        Prerequisite Charms: Hull-Hardening Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Abyssal extends his anima in a myriad of tendrils
        through the hull, caulking and patching breaches
        and split seams with raw Essence. Within moments, this
        energy calcifies into a durable material with the consistency
        and appearance of bleached bone. Repairing combat
        damage requires the Abyssal to spend motes equal to the
        ship’s damaged or destroyed rating, as appropriate to the
        severity of damage. For non-combat repairs and general
        caulking, the Storyteller should assign an Essence cost
        based on the severity of damage and the ship’s size.
        Sealing a leaky warship requires considerably more Essence
        than a river yacht.&lt;br&gt;
        While this Charm can stave off certain destruction by
        sealing massive breaches, it does not remove handling
        penalties for water trapped in the hull. Such penalties
        remain until the water is pumped or bailed out normally.
        This Charm requires something resembling an intact hull to
        work. It cannot regenerate entire missing segments, let alone
        restore a ruined hulk. Ships repeatedly treated with this
        Charm look far more like floating skeletons of behemoths
        than vessels fashioned by human hands. This Charm cannot
        repair ships of First Age design. This Charm lasts for a
        number of hours equal to the Abyssal’s Essence in Creation,
        but if the ship is in or enters a shadowland or the Underworld
        while the hull is so patched, the patches will endure so long
        as it does not leave that shadowland or the Underworld.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Although it is possible to strengthen and repair vessels
        with lesser Charms, an Abyssal with Unsinkable
        Derelict Preservation can enchant a ship to ignore damage
        entirely. The Exalt channels Essence through the ship’s
        hull, temporarily sealing all breaks and gashes with translucent
        wisps of relic from the Underworld. Ships ensorcelled
        with this Charm act entirely as if whole, keeping out water
        and moving with their normal maneuverability and speed.
        Further damage is also similarly ignored for the Charm’s
        duration. Once the Charm’s protection ends, severely
        damaged vessels take on water and sink normally. This
        Charm can even restore a rotting hulk to full operation, so
        long as enough of the hull remains to identify the ship.
        Vessels that have broken asunder cannot be enchanted, as
        they lack the material foundation to accept relic grafts.
        Ultimately, the Storyteller is the final arbiter of whether or
        not a ship retains enough substance to preserve. This
        Charm can affect First Age ships.

        The Abyssal attunes his mind to the communal memo-
        ries of the dead to act with due propriety and decorum.
        Characters under the effects of this Charm become fault-
        lessly — but not officiously — polite. They instinctively
        know the appropriate greeting customs or table manners
        for their situation and never run the risk of making an
        unintentional faux pas. This Charm is of paramount im-
        portance when dealing with ancient ghosts whose cultures
        and customs have long since fallen to the passing of Ages.

        The Abyssal concentrates on a victim in his line of
        sight, silently projecting a surge of visceral anger into her
        subconscious. For the rest of the turn, the target loses one
        die from all Socialize dice pools for every mote spent. This
        reduction manifests as poor manners, Freudian slips and
        other, similar gaffes. It is impossible to determine that the
        Charm’s target is acting under the influence of a curse
        without magical means, although astute observers (Perception
        + Awareness 4+) may suspect that something is
        amiss (Perception + Presence, difficulty equal to the
        Abyssal’s Essence). Abyssal Exalted normally employ Imprecation
        of Ill Manners to sabotage negotiations at a
        critical juncture or to discredit rivals.

        Caressing a victim’s mind with the corrupting taint of
        the Void, an Abyssal with this Charm can plant seeds of
        doubt in the faithful and erode trust in favor of treachery.
        The character need only spend a few minutes talking with
        her target; her player then rolls Manipulation + Socialize
        against a difficulty chosen by the Storyteller. This difficulty
        reflects the overall devotion of the target to the
        selected individual or cause. If she rolls enough successes,
        the target becomes suspicious and hostile toward whomever
        or whatever the Abyssal desires. This treacherous
        dislike lasts a number of hours equal to the deathknight’s
        permanent Essence. If the Exalt receives more successes
        than necessary, this duration is measured in days rather
        than hours. This Charm has no effect on beings with a
        higher Essence rating than the Abyssal.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By infecting a target’s very soul with festering Essence,
        the Abyssal can scour a heart of honor and righteousness.
        The Exalt must spend several minutes talking to the target,
        casting doubt on the importance of a particular Virtue. Her
        player then rolls Manipulation + Socialize, with a difficulty
        equal to the targeted Virtue. The victim temporarily
        loses one dot of the appropriate Virtue for every success in
        excess of its rating. If the number of successes exceeds the
        target’s Willpower score, the target also loses a permanent
        dot of the Virtue. Whether temporary or permanent, this
        Charm cannot reduce a Virtue below a rating of one.
        Virtues that are temporarily diminished return at the rate
        of one dot per hour. The Abyssal can even use this Charm
        on herself, with appropriate successes detracting from the
        targeted Virtue as normal. While this rationalization process
        has its uses — particularly in situations when scruples
        are a liability — the Abyssal risks permanent Virtue loss if
        she rationalizes too well.&lt;br&gt;
        Although a victim ensorcelled by this Charm retains
        his Nature, his behavior reflects his new Virtue rating. A
        Thrillseeker deprived of his once-considerable Valor will
        be torn by desires and a curiosity he can no longer bring
        himself to express. Likewise, a Survivor dropped to Compassion
        1 will do practically anything to anyone in order to
        preserve his existence.

        As cynical as they are pragmatic, characters with this
        Charm recognize that everyone can be bought. Their price
        might not be in jade or jewels — perhaps in a guiltier
        pleasure, a secret vice instead — but regardless, there is
        always something a person cannot resist or refuse. To have
        the object of her desire, an individual will betray her
        closest friends or worse. Upon activating this Charm, an
        Abyssal knows precisely what that object is for his target.
        He may not have the means of satisfying the desire in
        question, particularly if it is nigh impossible to acquire, but
        at least, he knows. The Storyteller should decide the
        nature of a target’s weakness, keeping in mind her Nature
        and Temperance score. Low Temperance characters are
        less disciplined and, thus, have easier wants to satisfy. High
        Temperance characters are invariably more difficult and
        complicated to satiate. It is always possible that some
        beatific saint exists on whom this Charm would have no
        effect, but no deathknight has ever met such a person in
        the decadent Age of Sorrows.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal perceives the flickering
        aura of emotion and passion overlaying her target. The
        Abyssal’s player rolls Perception + Socialize. This roll is
        made at standard difficulty if the target is not trying to
        conceal or misrepresent his feelings. Otherwise, the target’s
        player reflexively rolls Manipulation + Performance to
        resist. The amount of information the Abyssal gleans
        depends on the number of successes rolled beyond any the
        target may have garnered. Simple success reveals the
        target’s most dominant surface emotion. With three successes,
        the Abyssal can sense all of a target’s surface feelings
        and gauge their rough proportion to one another (i.e.,
        strong admiration with a touch of jealousy). Five or more
        successes allow the Abyssal to sense all emotions her target
        currently feels, as well is giving her a rough sense of the
        target’s permanent Willpower and Virtue allocation (weak,
        unremarkable, strong, overpowering, etc.). Regardless of
        the successes rolled, this Charm does not provide context.
        Even if a deathknight notices coiling tendrils of hatred in
        a target’s aura, she doesn’t automatically know who he
        hates or why he hates them.

        Some Abyssal Exalted are particularly adept at seed-
        ing the minds of mortals with such doubts about the true
        nature of life and death that they come to be obsessed with
        their own mortality. A deathknight must speak with a
        target at least briefly (the exchange need be only a few
        sentences), and the Abyssal’s player then makes a Manipulation
        + Socialize roll with a difficulty of the target’s
        permanent Essence. If successful, the target becomes depressed
        and withdrawn, suffering a +2 difficulty to all
        Social rolls for the next 24 hours. If this Charm is used
        continuously on an unExalted target for more days than
        her Conviction rating, her depression blossoms into an
        actual derangement. Targets thus afflicted continue to
        suffer Social penalties even after the Charm wears off.
