DEATH OF A HOST

While the death (or destruction) of a host
doesn’t mean the death of the rider, it can have
unpleasant consequences for the ghost in command.
The ghost is forcibly ejected from the host’s
body and stunned and unable to act for a number of
turns equal to the host’s Willpower.

Tangled Web Arts
----------------

Evoke the Ancient Clay
----------------------
Most ghosts can materialize. However, Materialize is
extremely expensive in Essence, and for ghosts, Materialize
only lasts one scene. The Lintha ghosts of the West
have discovered a slow progression of Arcanoi that culminate
in abilities that far exceed Materialize in every way
that matters. Of course, Materialize has no prerequisite,
and Evoke the Ancient Clay is a chain of Arcanoi, but
each of these arts provides benefits of its own, and many
provide limited versions of Embody at far lower Essence
costs than that art.

Shadow Constraint Craft
-----------------------

Ghosts’ activities are tightly constrained in the Underworld,
and mortals are bound as much, if not more so.
The secret laws of the Underworld stem from the Dual
Monarchy, which nearly every ghost venerates at least in
name. Ghosts who learn Shadow Constraint Craft learn to
manipulate the taboos and secret laws of the Underworld
and to punish ghosts and mortals who violate them.

Honored Ancestor Ways
---------------------

This minor art is uncommon in areas dominated by
the Immaculates, but it is quite common in the Underworld
just about everywhere else. Honored Ancestor Ways
allows its ghost practitioners to more effectively monitor
and interact with their living descendants.

.. mermaid:: ./mermaid/arcanoi/honored_ancestor_ways_1.mmd

Scholarly Ways
--------------

This art first cropped up around the centers of scholarly
learning within Stygia, as it relates to the levels of trust
between professor and student. Its secrets were distributed
early on by unscrupulous students, and it has subsequently
spread throughout the Underworld.

.. mermaid:: ./mermaid/arcanoi/scholarly_ways_1.mmd

Noble Craftsman Ways
--------------------

Ghostly craftsmen learn to manipulate soulsteel as well
as artifacts from Creation. Ghostly artisans realize that every
component of the Underworld contains the Essence of a
formerly living creature, and they use talents gained in life
to manipulate that crystallized Essence. The following
Charms all rely on the Craft Ability to some degree.

.. mermaid:: ./mermaid/arcanoi/noble_craftsman_ways_1.mmd

Tenacious Merchant's Way
------------------------

The merchants of the dead mostly deal in artifacts and
relics rather than in coin and jewels, though most king-
doms of the dead do have money of a sort. In any event,
Essence is the most important coin of the Underworld.
These Arcanoi allow a ghostly merchant to move Essence
from ghost to ghost, typically taking his own cut in the
process as a broker’s fee.

.. mermaid:: ./mermaid/arcanoi/tenacious_merchant_way_1.mmd

Chains of the Ancient Monarchs
------------------------------

This art descends from the enforcers and magistrates
of the Dual Monarchy in Stygia. Variations on their
talents have spread throughout the Underworld, though,
to the point where any ghost who holds a true allegiance
to an undead sovereign may learn and use these Arcanoi.
A ghost who learns this art doesn’t have to truly be an
authorized enforcer of his monarch — nor does he have to
possess true, deep loyalty to his lord — but he performs the
Arcanoi below in his lord’s name.
