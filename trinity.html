        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm functions exactly like the Immaculate
        Spirit Mastery Charm Spirit Sight. However,
        when the martial artist using this Charm perceives
        spirits, instead of seeing their true form, she perceives
        an outline of the spirit's form, a god-shaped cutout
        through which she beholds a field teeming with blossoming
        irises by the thousands.

        Type: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Martial Arts: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Walker-Among-Irises Perception&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm works exactly like the Immaculate Martial
        Arts Charm Spirit Walking. However, because this
        style lacks the ritualized diplomacy of the Dragon styles, a
        casual, &amp;quot;off the books&amp;quot; attitude flavors the Exalt's dealings
        with the little gods.&lt;br&gt;
        Martial artists using this style can be recognized as
        such by the large foot-wide irises that burst from whatever
        surface the Exalt is standing on (stone balcony,
        pool of water, air, etc) and blossom for a few moments
        before dissipating into a glittering cloud of purple-black
        Essence. There are other differences besides the obvious
        cosmetic effects.&lt;br&gt;
        Little gods who interact with the Terrestrial do so
        completely without the protection of Heaven. Though
        their murder may be avenged, Heaven turns a blind eye to
        slights against propriety inflicted by the Exalt while this
        Charm is in effect. The Exalt treats dematerialized spirits
        as if they were material for the remainder of the scene. The
        character may be hit by dematerialized beings and cannot
        necessarily see any spirits she may encounter without the
        use Walker-Among-Irises Perception.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition, during the duration of this Charm, if the
        Exalt's Essence is higher than the spirit's, all difficulties for
        the little god's Social rolls against the Terrestrial Exalt are
        increased by the difference in their permanent Essence
        ratings. This also applies in reverse — Exalts using this
        Charm on powerful deities may not enjoy what the deities
        say to them and suffer a similar penalty when interacting
        with gods whose Essence in higher than their own.

        The character becomes totally aware of the world
        around him, breathing in an awareness of his surroundings
        with the Essence of his respiration. No being that is
        not using Essence to conceal itself can hide from him
        within a radius equal to his Essence in yards. In addition,
        the character also benefits from the effects of a danger
        sense. Characters who possess this Charm can activate it
        reflexively when subject to a sneak attack to obviate the
        need for an ambush roll (see Exalted, p. 236 for rules on
        ambushes). This Charm does not grant the character the
        ability to see dematerialized spirits.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character's awareness of his environment allows
        him to strike true against even the hardiest foes.
        Characters who have mastered this technique can damage
        any foe they can hit. Essence for this Charm must be
        spent before the attack roll is made. After the attack is
        rolled but before any defenses are applied, the player may
        add his character's Martial Arts to the number of successes
        rolled on the attack. This Charm does not allow
        the character to damage individuals he cannot successfully
        strike with an attack. The character cannot attack
        dematerialized beings, for example, or beings who are for
        some reason immune to attack.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Speardancers do not wear armor when they take
        the battlefield, and clothing, if worn at all, is sheer and
        loose fitting so as not to hide nor hinder the lines of
        their dance. Instead, they rely on their ornate shields to
        deflect arrows and to bat away weapon strikes. An Exalt
        using the Graceful Tortoise Technique can incorporate
        the shield effortlessly into her deadly blade dance, even
        if the shield would otherwise be too large and cumbersome
        to use. After activating this Charm, the martial
        artist does not suffer any mobility penalty when using
        her shield for the scene. She may use a long spear or
        poleaxe one-handed so long as she uses a buckler or
        target shield on her other arm.

        Through the use of this Charm, the martial artist
        gains an acute awareness enabling her to use her polearm
        with great alacrity. Her familiarity with the extended
        reach afforded her by her weapon allows her to strike first
        in hand-to-hand combat. Upon activating this Charm,
        the martial artist adds her Essence rating to her Initiative.

        &lt;br&gt;
        To master the Form Charm, the martial artist has
        spent years developing her technique. Her muscles have
        been trained to supple perfection, and she is capable of
        graceful pas de géant and impressive acrobatic feats. Combined
        with her acute familiarity with her weapon, she can
        deliver attacks of devastatingly lethal precision. So perfect
        is her technique that she can masterfully place attacks
        where they will do the most damage. To activate the
        Crimson Pentacle Blade Form, the martial artist spends 5
        motes, and for the next scene, her player may add the
        character's Essence rating to Martial Arts rolls.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot use more than one Form-type
        Charm at a time. Using a Form-type Charm ends the
        effects of any other Form-type Charm the character
        was utilizing.

        Prerequisite Charms: Crimson Pentacle Blade Form&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The first thing learned in the Eastern posture is how
        to move together in a group and to use a shield effectively
        to protect the whole formation. With this Charm, a
        troupe of speardancers band together into an array and
        gain the benefit of each other's shields. The shields seem
        to move in a coiling, serpentine dance. There must be at
        least two martial artists in the formation to gain the
        benefit of this effect. Each participant gains an additional
        + 1 defensive bonus from the effects of the Charm, against
        both hand-to-hand and ranged attack. This bonus is
        provided by the shields of other members of the formation,
        and the formation is able to extend this protection
        to one person without a shield for every shield-bearing
        individual in the formation. No one who does not know
        the Eastern Root Protocol may benefit from this formation,
        and all members of the formation must be within
        the space permitted by the Five Directions Formation
        Protocol (see below). This Charm lasts for the remainder
        of the scene or until one of the Exalted moves more than
        10 yards away from any other member of the formation.

        Prerequisite Charms: Eastern Root Protocol&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        One of the most potent aspects of this martial-arts
        style is the ability for speardancers to work together in
        formations to accomplish martial effects otherwise
        impossible to them. While not a proper Charm in its
        own right, Five Directions Formation Protocol is an
        endless list of varying Charm Combos, or protocols,
        designed by the practitioners of Crimson Pentacle
        Blade Style. Protocols are a form of Combo empowered
        by a military formation instead of by one person.
        When a formation performs a protocol, the martial
        artists leap as one into a bounding choreography.
        Their bodies explore three-dimensional space, leaping
        and tumbling in concert as they perform the Charms in
        the protocol while always maintaining a shoulder-to-shoulder,
        back-to-back formation.&lt;br&gt;
        Protocols are a form of multi-participant Combo that
        are developed between specific individuals practicing the
        Crimson Pentacle style. Like Combos, they must be named
        and have a signature appearance that distinguishes them
        to those who have seen them before (see Exalted, p. 213,
        for more information).&lt;br&gt;
        The maximum distance by which all the most distantly
        located martial artists performing the protocol can
        be separated by is 10 yards. Also, all the martial artists
        must be within this area prior to invoking the protocol.
        Movement speed for all martial artists in the protocol is
        equal to the Exalt with the lowest movement speed
        unless a Charm that boosts movement speed is part of the
        protocol. In that case, all who are a part of the protocol
        may enjoy it's benefits, so long as the critical distance
        limit is not broken. If any participant is ever more than
        10 yards from any other participant for any other reason,
        the protocol ends instantly. Individuals are aware before
        they break the protocol, however, and will not stumble
        outside of its borders without some reason. The players of
        all the participants may make a reflexive Perception +
        Awareness roll at difficulty 1 for their characters to note
        the failure of the protocol in time to invoke any reflexive
        effects in the protocol in the instant before it is broken.&lt;br&gt;
        All members of a protocol must be present to activate
        it — casualties or absentees render a protocol impossible to
        perform, and the pursuit of flexibility and loss-resilience
        can lead speardancer ensembles to expend a great deal of
        energy developing alternate protocols. All participants
        must be conscious, mobile and able to take reflexive
        actions (meaning none can be ambushed, as per Exalted,
        p. 238). Activating a protocol is effectively activating a
        Combo, and every Exalt in the protocol must be eligible to
        do so, meaning one cannot have used another Charm or
        Combo this turn.&lt;br&gt;
        When one member of the protocol attempts to
        activate the protocol and the protocol is legal, every
        member of the protocol is instantly aware of the attempt
        and may choose to join. Only if all members of the
        protocol join the activation does the protocol actually
        activate. Otherwise, no costs are paid or other actions
        forgone. Attempting to activate a protocol is a reflexive
        action that may be and generally is done immediately
        after initiative is rolled and before any actions are taken.
        When the protocol is activated, every Exalt in the group
        must spend a point of temporary Willpower and has
        access to all the Charms in the protocol.
        The rules for developing Combos still apply to the
        development of protocols. Every Exalt in the protocol
        must know Five Directions Formation Protocol, but only
        one needs to know any of the Charms in the Protocol, and
        only the individuals who know the Charm need to meet
        it's Minimum Essence and Minimum Ability requirements.
        The experience point cost and time it takes to
        develop a protocol is the same as for a Combo. The
        experience cost of the protocol is divided among the
        members of the fighting group as evenly as possible, with
        the Exalts with the highest Essence + Martial Arts paying
        the extra point if the cost cannot be divided evenly. In the
        case of a tie in the Traits, all eligible Dragon-Blooded pay
        the extra point. Talons comprised of martial artists of the
        Crimson Pentacle Style sometimes spend years designing
        and perfecting large, multi-Charm protocols.&lt;br&gt;
        However, the Essence cost to fuel it are split evenly by
        the members of the formation. In the case of an odd
        number, the person with the highest Martial Arts ability
        must pay the extra cost. Every member in the formation
        must add a Charm to the protocol, and it is the acting
        speardancer's Traits, +1 per every person performing the
        protocol, that are rolled when that Charm is activated in
        the Combo. Individual Essence and Willpower ratings,
        however, remain the same.&lt;br&gt;
        Keep in mind that this Charm in no way negates
        Combo prohibitions of other Charms. Only Martial Arts
        Charms and Charms that are explicitly permitted to be in
        Combos with the Charms from other Abilities may be
        included in a protocol.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition to the normal effects of a Combo, there is
        one added feature of these protocols — Exalted martial
        artists who have Charms active with a duration longer
        than instant may reflexively spend 1 mote of Essence when
        the protocol is activated and bleed the effects to another
        member of the formation. Each Charm must be bled
        separately onto each participant in the formation. Sharing
        Charm effects is optional. Every Exalt in the protocol can
        share any effect of non-instant duration active on them at
        the time the protocol is activated, provided they can afford
        the Essence cost.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt sharing the Charm pays for it, and the
        original roll is used, but use the affected character's Traits
        if the effect uses the recipient's Traits for some purpose.
        The effects of the Charm last for as long on each member
        of the protocol as they would have when originally invoked
        and will be ended by any conditions that would
        normally end that Charm. Characters cannot have more
        than one Form-type Charm active on them at a time, as
        usual and cannot share Charms that are attainments of
        capability that permanently enhance the Exalt, such as
        Ox-Body Technique.&lt;br&gt;
        Protocols take advantage of the inherent group-ori-
        entation of the Terrestrial Exalted. Those Exalts who are
        not Terrestrials must pay double the experience costs to
        develop these Combos. This Charm has no cost, save the
        costs of the protocols created with it, but instead, indicates
        the attainment of an ability.&lt;br&gt;
        The benefits lent by this Charm are bonus dice from
        a Martial Art and cannot exceed the character's Attribute
        + Ability on any one roll.

        Although all martial artists of this style are capable of
        dazzling feats of fighting prowess, it is through the cold,
        logical efficiency of movement of the &amp;quot;minimalist&amp;quot; Northern posture that the potency of the style is truly realized.
        When the Exalt invokes this Charm, her target must add
        her permanent Essence rating to the difficulty to defend
        against her attack.

        Martial Arts roll. Successes on this roll are added to the

        To break as waves against a defiant reef, such is
        the fate of any who would dare attack a disciple
        knowledgeable in the Western posture. Although effective
        in a one-on-one fight, disciples of the Western
        Shield Posture specifically developed this Charm to
        break enemy formations.&lt;br&gt;
        If the martial artist's opponent makes an unsuccess-
        ful attack, the martial artist makes a reflexive
        counterattack by slamming her shield into her foe,
        knocking him to the ground. The speardancer's player
        makes a Reflexive roll using her character's Dexterity +
        Martial Arts pool. This is a counterattack, not an
        action. The martial artist's target can defend against
        this normally, but Charms that produce counterattacks
        cannot counterattack the user of this Charm. If success-
        ful, her target is brought to his knees and fights as if
        prone until he stands. If the speardancer scores more
        successes than her target has combined dots of Strength
        + Essence, he is knocked to the ground winded and
        prone. He is at -2 for prone fighting and -2 for being
        stunned, and his player must make a reflexive (Wits +
        appropriate Ability for use of his weapon) roll and score
        as many successes as the martial artist's Essence, or the
        character's disarmed.&lt;br&gt;
        Make the reflexive roll before applying the penalties.
        The martial artist may make as many Western Shield
        Crush Counterattacks in a turn as she can afford to pay for,
        but a character cannot use this Charm in response to any
        counterattack Charm. For rules on prone fighting and
        stunning, see Exalted, pages 234-235.

        With this Charm, the Exalt is able to fortify herself
        with Essence. She takes a breath and concentrates. When
        she exhales, Essence-laden energy coruscates and whirls
        about her arms and upper torso. The Exalt's forearms
        become heavily encrusted with large gems that work their
        way up her shoulders and upper back. The appearance of
        the Jeweled Vambraces and Mantle is appropriate to the
        Exalt's elemental aspect. For example, a Water-aspect
        martial artist might become scaled like a sea urchin with
        spines ofsaffron coral, studded with black pearls in chitonous
        clusters. Regardless of the appearance, the Exalt who
        invokes this Charm adds her Essence score to her bashing
        and lethal soaks for the scene. The Blessing of Jeweled
        Vambraces and Mantle is not considered to be armor, but
        a form of natural soak and, therefore, does not contradict
        the armor prohibition for this martial-arts style.

        &lt;br&gt;
        As the martial artist adopts the flamboyant and
        sensual attitude of the Southern posture, she can use her
        grandiose, sweeping katas to inspire others to acts of
        great valor. As the Exalt invokes this Charm, a banner
        of pure Essence erupts from the head of her polearm.
        The banner's edge is intricately woven with precious
        gems and curves rakishly from its base till it ends in a six-
        foot-long pendant tail. Characters in High Realm
        encouraging fearlessness in battle and diligence to duty
        are emblazened along its length, and tassels of fiery
        Essence dot the tail's inner curve. The martial artist
        then uses the weapon to perform an awe-inspiring
        display before her troops. Once invoked, the pendant
        lasts for the entire scene or until the Exalt who invoked
        it wishes otherwise.&lt;br&gt;
        This display uses her Charisma + Martial Arts, at a
        base difficulty of 1, +1 difficulty for every three targets
        she wishes to affect. Success means she effectively stirs
        the crowd into a battle fury and all those thusly inspired
        are gifted with one temporary Valor point that can be
        used per the Virtue rules (see Exalted, p. 129). This bonus
        point of Valor lasts for a scene and can exceed its Trait
        maximum. Also, this Charm is stackable, but only if
        invoked by separate speardancers — no one martial artist
        can give an individual more than one Valor point in a
        single scene through the use of this Charm.

        The Essence pendant crystallizes into a gem encrusted
        scythe. Its tassels harden giving the scythe a kris pointed
        serrated edge and it is wickedly sharp. The scythe has a
        Speed 0, Attack 0, Damage +12L, Parry -2, and Rate 3.
        Characters cannot activate this Charm until they have

        Speardancer masters believe that once one is committed

        indefinitely and also prevent anyone from escaping
        combat once they've crossed blades with her. The
        character spends Essence, and for the next scene, her
        player may make a reflexive Dexterity + Martial Arts
        roll for the Exalt to attack anyone who tries to flank or
        otherwise get around her, to a maximum distance
        equal to the martial artist's Essence in yards. She may
        also make such an attack if her opponent attempts to
        flee her presence once he has entered into hand-to-
        hand combat. In addition, the martial artist cannot be
        moved from the spot by any means unless she, herself,
        breaks her stance.

        The Central posture is more of a mode of conduct
        than a speardancing style. Living life in a state of honorable
        grace is preferred. And having one's weapon put to
        a noble cause is the height of achievement all who walk
        the path of the Crimson Pentacle Blade strive to attain.
        With this Charm, the Exalt fortifies and enriches his
        weapon to that purpose. The Exalt spends a little while
        ritually cleaning and sharpening his weapon. When he is
        done, he speaks aloud the task to which his weapon shall
        be used victoriously.&lt;br&gt;
        For the next day, the martial artist may add his
        permanent Essence to the damage rating of his weapon
        when it is bent to this task. This task must be a specific one.
        Also, the martial artist may stack as many tasks on a single
        weapon as he has points in permanent Essence. However,
        the maximum damage bonus awarded by this Charm to a
        single strike cannot exceed the character's Essence.

        On the field of battle, a master of the Crimson
        Pentacle Blade Style is a weapon specialist without peer.
        She perceives the churning chaos of death and discord that
        is battle instead as a grand choreography. The speardancer's
        moving and acrobatic style enables her to position herself
        centrally, maximizing her weapon's effectiveness against
        multiple foes. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt
        perceives a singular, circular attack pattern that enables
        her to strike a number of opponents equal to her permanent
        Essence in one efficient stroke. The character's player
        makes a single Dexterity + Martial Arts roll for her to hit
        all targets at + 1 difficulty for each target after the first, to
        a maximum +3 difficulty. Targets must then defend individually,
        as normal. Also, if the attack is successful, the
        martial artist counts the successes twice for the purposes of

        With this Charm, the Exalt is able to move from a
        perfectly relaxed, unassuming pose to strike her opponent,
        effectively ambushing him with a surprise attack while in
        full view. The martial artist must not be in combat with her
        opponent in order for this Charm to be effective. After
        activating this Charm, the opponent's player makes a reflexive
        Perception + Awareness roll for his character, with
        a difficulty equal to the martial artist's permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        If this roll fails, the Exalt's opponent cannot dodge or
        parry this attack without the use of Charms. If it succeeds,
        the opponent is not taken completely off guard and can
        dodge or parry as normal but cannot attack until he enters
        into combat turns with the martial artist. Charms such as
        Surprise Anticipation Method can negate the effects of
        this Charm if they are active or if they are reflexive and the
        target chooses to activate them.

        enables the martial artist using it to be frustratingly hard to

        and &amp;quot;dances&amp;quot; about her, inside the attack range of her
        Melee, Martial Arts or Brawl weapon, thereby nullifying
        its speed and accuracy bonuses. Also, being in such close

        The Exalt begins a meditative prana that takes about
        20 minutes to complete. In that time, the martial artist
        channels powerful Essence through his form. His muscles
        are imbued with a liquid suppleness, and his bones and skin
        are fortified with an oaken flexibility. For every 4 motes of
        Essence the martial artist spends, add 1 to his Strength or
        Stamina. For every 6 motes of Essence, add 1 to his
        Dexterity. Body of War Meditation can be used more than
        once, the effects are cumulative, and the Exalt's Attributes
        can be raised above Trait maximums. The character cannot,
        however, raise any of his Physical Attributes by more
        dots than he has in his permanent Essence rating, regardless
        of how many times he uses this Charm.

        Instead of extending himself to strike his opponent's

        weapon arm in an attempt to disarm him. The Exalt makes
        a Dexterity + Martial Arts attack that does no damage at
        a difficulty of 1. The target may dodge or parry as if it were
        a normal attack but with a base difficulty equal to the
        attacking Exalt's Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        If the disarming roll is successful, the target's player

        The disciples of this style practice a state of being
        known as &amp;quot;Selfless Mind.&amp;quot; Through diligent, introspective
        meditation, they learn to divorce themselves of
        emotions or other distractions that would keep them
        from their set course of action. This form is the perfect
        expression of that ability.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist takes a moment to center himself
        and spends the motes of Essence to fuel the Charm. His
        body relaxes as he releases his mind from the burden of
        emotions and social mores and taboos. Transcended, a
        contented smile piques the corners of the martial artist's
        mouth. It is from the display of this Charm that martial
        artists of this style have come to be known also as
        &amp;quot;Blissful Sages.&amp;quot; For the remainder of the scene, the
        Exalt does not need to make Virtues tests. Slavering
        hordes of the walking dead will not keep him from the
        field, nor will a burning house of innocents distract him
        from pursuing his adversary.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot use more than one Form-type
        Charm at a time. Using a Form-type Charm ends the
        effects of any other Form-type Charm the character
        was utilizing.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The masters who discovered and developed martial
        arts obtained the principles of their fighting styles through
        meditation on the world around them: the graceful dance
        of wind through an orchard, the stoic fortitude of mountains,
        the ferocious and cunning strength of a pack of
        lionesses taking down a yeddim. It is also said that these
        masters were completely unassailable. No technique could
        defeat them. So diligent were they in their meditations,
        they had walked in the footsteps of no less than ten
        thousand things. The very principles of Creation were
        known to them, and there was not a fighting style of sword
        or fist that could remain inscrutable to them. It is on this
        principle that this Charm is based.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist takes a moment to size up his
        opponent, either by fighting her, by watching her demonstrate
        her style or by watching her fight someone else. The
        Exalt's player makes a Perception + Martial Arts roll with
        a difficulty equal to his opponent's Martial Arts Ability. If
        successful, he may add any successes over and above the set
        difficulty to his Martial Arts attacks against that opponent
        when she uses the scrutinized fighting style.&lt;br&gt;
        For each turn the Exalt studies his opponent and
        spends the Essence for this Charm, the difficulty drops by
        1, to minimum of difficulty 3. The martial artist can meaningfully
        scrutinize his opponent for a maximum number of
        turns equal to his Essence, and these turns do not have to
        be consecutive ones. Once all the character's turns are
        exhausted, he gains nothing by observing her again until
        he increases his Essence. The successes on multiple rolls
        are not cumulative. Only the highest number of successes
        on a single roll may be kept.&lt;br&gt;
        The experience points spent for this Charm are spent
        only once, no matter how many times the player of martial
        artist invoking this Charm makes the Perception + Martial
        Arts roll against his character's opponent.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The fact that Essence flows through all things and
        that martial arts is a way to channel and direct these
        energies is a fundamental principle understood by all
        martial artists. Disciples of the Celestial Monkey Style
        have refined this understanding to an exquisite degree.
        As Essence flows through the land, there are places
        where these flows convene, nexus points known as
        Demesnes. Such nexus points exist in the body as well.
        These places of convergence, of which there are four,
        are known as the Gates of Virtue. Sages of the Celestial
        Monkey Style believe that each of these gates is attuned
        to one of the Divine Virtues. They are: the Crown of
        Temperance (head), the Chalice of Compassion (sternum),
        the Throne of Conviction (stomach) and the
        Root of Valor (groin). In combat, as the martial artist
        invokes this Charm, four Essence-laden rings encircle
        these locations on his opponent, glowing at various
        intensities corresponding to how &amp;quot;firmly seated&amp;quot; she is
        in each of her Virtues.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist then makes an attack against one of
        these Gates at a +3 difficulty. If successful, roll damage as
        usual. If any damage exceeds his opponent's soak, his
        opponent takes an additional amount of lethal damage
        equal to the Virtue that corresponds to the location in
        which she was struck.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Omun Dos, a mighty Lunar Celestial
        Monkey, apes and cavorts around a highly angered and
        frustrated Terrestrial Exalt of the Wyld Hunt trying to
        kill him. Omun Dos opens his mind and perceives the
        young Exalt's four Gates of Virtue and sees that his
        opponent is highly centered in her Root of Valor.
        Omun Dos punches her and succeeds in getting two
        levels of damage over his opponent's considerable soak.
        The young Exalt has a Valor of 5. As such, she takes an
        additional five levels of lethal damage and drops squeal-
        ing to her knees.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, the martial artist is able manipulate
        his own Gates of Virtue with virtuosity. They no
        longer remain stationary within his body. Instead, he is
        able to move these nexus points about within his own
        form. Doing so creates strange, spherical fields of Essence,
        with a radius about the length of a man's forearm,
        around his body wherever he moves the gates. This
        causes no harm to the martial artist. However, those
        witnessing him using this Charm will see glittering
        coronas in the color and appearance of the Exalt's
        anima banner flare around the Exalt's extremities as he
        manipulates these spherical fields.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist is able to utilize these Essence fields
        to parry any incoming attack, hand-to-hand or ranged,
        using his full Dexterity + Martial Arts pool for the scene.
        He does not have to be able to move to do this. In fact, the
        Blissful Sage need not get up from the lotus-position he was
        sitting in before these unfortunate, misguided fools tried to
        disturb his meditations.&lt;br&gt;
        Also, for the scene, the martial artist may add his
        permanent Essence to all Martial Arts attacks.

        Masters of the Celestial Monkey Style are so acutely
        aware of how they move through Creation — or, more
        importantly, how Essence moves through them and the
        world around them while they move through Creation —
        they can fortify, enrich and empower their actions just by
        attuning themselves to the world around them. After
        buying this Charm, the martial artist can treat all unaided
        attacks and attacks he makes with any Charms of this style
        as unarmed attacks, no matter what weapon he uses. All
        Strength, Dexterity or Martial Arts minimums required
        for the use of weapons are halved, rounded up. Also,
        wearing armor no longer hinders his ability to perform this
        martial-arts style. This Charm has no costs. It is simply an
        enhancement of the Exalt's capabilities.

        With this Charm, the Exalt imbues her props with
        lethal Essence. In the hands of the martial artist, a delicate
        paper fan can cut like a mighty scimitar. Despite the
        Charm's name, these benefits can also be applied to other
        items as well. The character can treat all paper fans and
        other similar props such as brushes and mirrors as wind-fire
        wheels. All sashes, long hems, sleeves and so on can be
        treated as seven-section staves. The damage inflicted with
        these weapons is lethal. This does not change the appearance
        of the item thus imbued, just it's damage potential.
        The sash will remain it's flowing silken self, and a fan will
        still look like a fan.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition, if the character is using a fan or other
        accouterment properly-constructed for use in the martial
        arts, Upon activating this Charm, the character may
        increase the accuracy, parry, speed or damage bonus of
        her weapon (pick any one at activation) by her permanent
        Essence score.

        Prerequisite Charms: Demure Carp Feint, Pearlescent Filigree Defense, Lethal Paper Fan Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        As the martial artist affects the demure and sensual
        dance of the Pearl Courtesan, her accoutrements and
        robes take on a life of their own, enhancing and
        complimenting her movements. At her command, her
        fans unfurl and ripple enticingly about her body. Her
        sashes swirl in a coy serpentine dance, and her flowing
        sleeves and gossamer robes unfold and gather at her
        whim. The Exalt does not have to manually control these
        props in order to allow for this effect. They do so auto-
        matically, leaving her hands free.&lt;br&gt;
        Upon activating this Charm, the martial artist can
        control one prop per dot in her permanent Essence score.
        For example, an Exalt with an Essence score of 4 can
        control one fan, one sash, one of her flowing sleeves and
        the hem of her cloak, or she could control four fans at once.
        Which props the Exalt intends to command must be
        decided before the activation of this Charm. If the martial
        artist wishes to add or change a prop, she must drop the
        present invocation of this form and reactivate it at the
        beginning of the next turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Objects the martial artist wishes to command must be
        on her person. Also, she cannot make an attack with these
        props unless she is manually controlling them. To do so
        and leave her hands free requires her to use the Flurry of
        August Leaves Concentration Charm. While this form is
        active, the Exalt's player may add her character's Martial
        Arts to all Presence and Socialize rolls. Characters cannot
        use more than one Form-type Charm at a time.

        &lt;br&gt;
        At this level, the fan dancer has an acute understanding
        of spatial awareness and how the supple flows of air
        currents can affect the &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; of lighter materials such as
        silk and paper. Armed with this knowledge, the martial
        artist can use her props to surprising effect at range. The
        Exalt casts her fan or sash into the air. At her command it
        flicks and swoops toward it's intended target before spinning
        obediently back to her. If this Charm is activated
        while the martial artist is using the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan
        Form, she can command up to the number of props
        allowed by that Charm to make multiple attacks against
        one target. This Charm allows the martial artist to strike
        a target up to (Martial Arts x 5) yards away.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt makes a single attack with her Martial Arts
        pool, as usual, regardless of how many weapons she is
        controlling. Successes from the roll are applied to all
        weapons, and the damage is determined using her Strength
        as if were a normal Martial Arts attack. This attack can be
        parried or dodged like a normal Martial Arts attack, and
        the target's player need only make one roll for his character
        to parry or dodge this effect. Botched attacks can result in
        broken or lost props or injury to the martial artist who cast
        them. She must pay the cost of this Charm for each prop
        she wishes to command. Also, this Charm can only be used
        on props that can be separated from the Exalt's body. For
        example, she cannot use her cape while it's still tied around
        her neck. However, props in the grips of the Dreaming
        Pearl Courtesan form are considered explicitly &amp;quot;in-hand&amp;quot;
        for the purposes of this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, the Exalt is able to use her flowing
        garments with a prehensile dexterity to grapple opponents
        and their weapons. After successfully dodging or otherwise
        negating an enemy's attack, the Exalt's player may make a
        reflexive Dexterity + Martial Arts roll to have her
        character's skirt, cloak or flowing sleeves move to snare her
        opponents weapon or fist.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist must score as many successes as her
        opponent did on his attack to make a successful grapple.
        The defender may evade this only with Charms or by
        splitting his dice pool. If her opponent is using a weapon
        and the martial artist scores successes equal to or higher
        than her opponent's Melee, Martial Arts or Brawl score,
        the character has the option of disarming the target rather
        than clinching him.&lt;br&gt;
        After successfully clinching her enemy, the martial
        artist enters into a resisted roll against her opponent using
        her Dexterity + Martial Arts dice pool against his Strength
        + Brawl, Melee or Martial Arts dice pool. The rules for
        clinching still apply. If the Exalt is using the Dreaming
        Pearl Courtesan Form when this Charm is activated, she
        may make as many of these reflexive grapples as allowed by
        that form Charm. The cost of this Charm must be spent for
        each reflexive grapple the Exalt wishes to make.

        There is a saying that the most vicious fights are the
        ones between siblings or lovers. The person who knows
        someone the most intimately can circumvent his defenses
        and hurt him the most deeply. It is in the spirit of this
        aphorism that this technique was developed.&lt;br&gt;
        Most armor only covers the vital areas of the body,
        leaving the hardier or less lethal areas uncovered. Even
        superheavy plate is donned and removed in pieces: the
        helm, the back and shoulder guards, the breastplate, the
        greaves and leggings, etc. It is a testament to the smith's
        craft if the seams between the different pieces are too
        narrow for an arrow or blade to pierce. Paper and silk,
        however, are thinner than even the sharpest blade, and in
        the hands of a martial artist using this Charm, can be used
        to deadly effect. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt
        negates points of her opponent's armor soak equal to her
        Essence + Martial Arts. This does not negate her target's
        natural soak or any bonuses gained through the use of
        Charms, merely his armor.

        &lt;br&gt;
        As the Exalt performs the fluid and languid moves of
        the Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata, hundreds of glowing
        flower petals flow out of her sleeves and the folds of her
        robes and spiral about her. The players of all those within
        the Exalt's Essence in yards must succeed in a resisted
        Willpower roll against her player, or their characters are
        transfixed in place, enraptured by the beauty of the kata
        and perfume of the petals. Even those whose players
        succeed in the roll find themselves subjected to a hallucinogenic
        vertigo, as if in a waking dream, and suffer a
        penalty to all dice pools equal to the Exalt's Essence while
        in the range of the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Those entranced by this Charm are highly susceptible
        to suggestion and will believe whatever the Exalt
        tells them to be truthful. Also, the Exalt can issue
        commands to those enraptured and, unless the orders are
        suicidal, expect them to be followed. These suggestive
        effects, however, do not effect those with a higher permanent
        Essence rating than the martial artist. If for any
        reason the Exalt halts her kata, or the scene ends, the
        fascination begins to wear off. The effects linger for a
        number of turns equal to the martial artist's Essence.
        During this period of reduced effects, the victims suffer a
        dice-pool penalty equal to the Exalt's Essence. Those
        thus enraptured will have vague memories of what transpired
        while under the effects of this Charm and will
        suffer a strange melancholia, adding +1 difficulty to
        Conviction rolls made for them for a number of days
        equal to the Exalt's Essence.

        The martial artist takes a deep breath and concentrates.
        When she exhales, tendrils of pastel fumes escape
        her lips. Her clothing and hair whip about her as if
        caught in an unseen maelstrom. In a flash, she becomes
        a vortex of swirling light that quickly disappears only to
        reappear a distance of (the Exalt's Martial Arts x 5)
        yards away. While performing this Charm, the martial
        artist can take no other action.

        &lt;br&gt;
        It is believed by the masters of this style that all
        things in Creation are expressions of duality, a marriage
        of form and the infinitely possible, and that all sentient
        creatures experience this potential from the safety of
        their dreams. Here, desires are laid bare, wishes are
        fulfilled, and nightmares stalk those unwilling to confront
        their inner demons. The savants of this style argue
        that a person's dreams are not a phenomenon unique to
        an individual, but instead &amp;quot;The Dreaming,&amp;quot; as they refer
        to this collective subconsciousness, is a commonality.
        All sentient creatures share and are a part of it. Here,
        they may touch the infinite, however briefly, without
        fear of losing sight of the singularity that is their &amp;quot;self.&amp;quot;
        Masters of this style seek to achieve a perfect waking
        and lucid union of this dual principle. With this Charm,
        they are briefly able to breach this threshold and achieve
        its perfect form, the mighty Chimera. The martial artist
        opens herself to this same collective consciousness and
        transcends, assuming the form of this fell and beautiful
        creature. A pillar of swirling light shines down upon the
        Exalt. Her clothing and accoutrements disappear as her
        form becomes long and sinewy, growing to five times
        her normal height. Her neck extends up to four feet in
        length and supports her delicate and golden beaked
        foal's head. She is crowned with four sets of gazelle's
        horns that whip and spiral, reshaping themselves like
        tendrils of smoke. Eyes ranging from the size of small
        pearls to the size of goose eggs line either side of her
        narrow snout and continue down her back, collecting in
        shifting patterns by the hundreds, blazing like sapphires
        in the noonday sun, blinking demurely.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt's entire form is covered with gold-veined
        pearl scales, which afford her an additional 6L/12B
        armor. Instead of arms or legs, the martial artist gains a
        pair of four-foot-wide, barbed carp's fins for every point
        of her permanent Essence, which can strike for Strength
        +3 damage and enable her to hover in or swim through
        the air with serpentine grace at 45 miles per hour. While
        using this Charm, the Exalt cannot be surprised or lied
        to, as secrets echo like the whispers of wind chimes
        between her coils and opponents' intentions play out
        like gossamer filigree about her. Also, the Exalt has a
        number of actions per turn equal to her Essence. These
        are full extra actions, the martial artist may split her
        dice pools, and this effect is incompatible with other
        extra actions effects.&lt;br&gt;
        There is, however, a certain risk involved when
        Invoking the Chimera's Coils. The Exalt experiences an
        ecstatic bliss while in this form, and if she is not careful,
        she will forget that she once was mortal and lose herself
        to the collective knowledge of humanity's dreams, remain
        transcendent and pass out of this realm of existence.
        This Charm lasts for as long as the Exalt wishes, and she
        must spend a point of temporary Willpower to end it. For
        every scene after the first she remains in this form, she
        must make a Willpower roll at an additional + 1 difficulty.
        If at any time she fails this roll, she disappears in a
        blinding flash of pearlescent light. The Exalted have lost
        some of their mightiest martial artists in this way. Once
        thus transcended, none ever return.

        The character draws a breath and concentrates,
        extending her senses to feel the flow of Essence that
        unites her, her weapon and her target. In this perfect
        moment, the Exalt fires her weapon, and her firewand's
        tongue of flame seeks out her intended target with
        knowing assurance. For each mote of Essence the player
        spends, his player may add one die to any Martial Arts
        roll using a firewand or similar weapon. This added
        bonus cannot exceed the character's Dexterity + Martial
        Arts pool. Essence for this Charm must be spent
        prior to the attack roll.

        At this level, the character becomes more intimately
        aware of how Essence flows through her and her weapon
        and is able to dramatically increase the damage her weapon
        can do based on this understanding. As with Kiss of the
        Sun Concentration, the character draws a breath, concentrates
        and then fires her weapon. This time, however, the
        once thin stream of flame expands to twice its normal
        girth, spiraling out from its center like a blossoming peony
        of flame. The player activates the Charm and doubles the
        damage done on a successful Martial Arts attack using a
        firewand or some similar weapon. The bonus damage is
        applied before the target rolls to soak.

        Vibrant cobalt lightning crackles and coalesces about
        her forearm, and in one fluid motion, the Exalt readies
        her firewand and fires. The player spends 2 motes of
        Essence to invoke this Charm. Aside from the benefit of
        surprise, &amp;quot;shooting from the hip&amp;quot; enables the character to
        attack more quickly, adding 1 to her Initiative rating per
        point of her permanent Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By entering this meditative state, the Exalt becomes
        a conduit for the righteous fury of the sun itself.
        Her firewand blazes with an inner light as brilliant
        as daylight, and her attacks sear with the intensity
        of solar flares. For the duration of this Charm, all
        Martial Arts attacks made with a firewand or similar
        weapon ignore all armor and natural soak. In addition,
        the character adds her permanent Essence to the damage
        dealt by such attacks.&lt;br&gt;
        The player spends 2 motes of Essence for her character
        to invoke the blessing, and these motes are considered
        committed until the Exalt fires the weapon, releasing
        the charge. Add the character's permanent Essence to
        the base damage of the firewand or similar weapon when
        it is next fired.&lt;br&gt;
        If this Charm is used against creatures of the Un-
        derworld or Abyssal Exalted, the damage dealt is
        aggravated. If the Solar using this Charm also invokes
        Fire Blossom of Inevitable Demise, the bonus dice are
        added after the damage has been doubled. The in-
        creased damage dice gained with Blessing of Righteous
        Solar Spark Meditation cannot be doubled with Fire
        Blossom of Inevitable Demise Technique or any Charm
        that doubles base damage.&lt;br&gt;
        If the martial artist has multiple firewands, the
        Blessing of Righteous Solar Spark can only be invoked
        on one at a time, and if done in combat, it takes two
        turns to do so. Finally, if the Solar using a &amp;quot;blessed
        firewand&amp;quot; invokes an attack Charm that allows her to
        make multiple attacks, the bonus damage must be divided
        evenly among her targets.&lt;br&gt;
        Only Solar Exalted can use this particular Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Despite the superior damage capabilities of
        firewands, there are certain drawbacks to using them:
        the low availability and astronomical price of firedust,
        just to name a couple. Also, their temperamental nature
        and need for constant upkeep and repair make them
        difficult choices for use in the field. But perhaps the
        biggest difficulty in using firewands is that most flame-discharge
        weapons are single-shot ones. The martial
        artist must take a turn to reload a firewand after each
        shot. However, a Solar with this Charm is able to bypass
        this particular weakness.&lt;br&gt;
        After the character makes an attack with his weapon,
        the player may spend 1 mote for his character and make
        a Reflexive Wits + Martial Arts roll, difficulty 2. The
        character's hands move too fast for unExalted eyes to see,
        trailing translucent clouds of black firedust that waft
        about his torso. If the roll is successful, the Solar Exalted
        successfully reloads his weapon and can bring it to bear
        before his next action. If the roll fails, he is unable to load
        the weapon correctly. If he manages to botch, the Storyteller
        should feel free to use her twisted imagination to
        describe what happens when those black firedust clouds,
        from which the Charm gets its name, ignite about the
        martial artist's upper torso. A botch can be especially bad
        if the character is using a First Age weapon.

        The martial artist takes on an executioner's terrible
        stillness. Shadows seem to darken about his eyes and
        render his features gaunt, giving him an imposing,
        dreadful gaze. He is the fatal answer to the depraved and
        unjust, the retribution all who would defy Heaven knew
        must someday come. After activating this Charm, all
        extras who lay eyes on the martial artist will move
        unassumingly, as not to draw attention to themselves,
        yet swiftly for cover, pull their children inside and bolt
        their doors.&lt;br&gt;
        Targets of the martial artist within a radius equal
        to (the martial artist's Essence x 10) yards feel a sense
        of foreboding and are compelled to confront the mar-
        tial artist. Up until a target actually makes eye contact
        with the Exalt, her player must make a successful
        reflexive Willpower roll each turn with a difficulty
        equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence rating, or her
        character moves to confront the Exalt. Characters
        may spend a point of temporary Willpower to stop this
        compulsion. Once she has spent a turn engaged in
        combat or parley with the Exalt, this effect ends for the
        remainder of the scene.

        halo of gold and cobalt light encircles the tip of the

        six golden swan wings, each the length of a woman's
        forearm, gracefully spiral out of the halo and speed the
        tongue of flame to its extended target. The player

        weapon at twice its normal range.

        connections that tie her and her weapon to her target
        become glaringly apparent to her. At this point, she can
        close her eyes, for she need not see her target to strike it.
        Her Caste Mark flares and pulses with the beating of her
        own heart. At the same moment, a series of notched rings
        of silvery azure light encircle her target. They are of
        varying widths, numbering between three and nine in
        total, and rotate around the target at odd angles, some
        spinning clockwise, while others spin widdershins.&lt;br&gt;
        This is the Azure Abacus. In the days of the First Age,
        this Charm was an artful meditation of the most introspec-
        tive and intimate — and, some considered, prideful —
        nature, for it measured, some believed, a soul's nature,
        existence and importance in the grand scope of Creation.
        Unfortunately, in this dark Age, the knowledge of how to
        glean any pertinent information from such a display is
        completely lost, even to the martial artist invoking this
        Charm. If there are any alive who remember how to gauge
        the delicate nuances of the Azure Abacus, they are not
        sharing the information.&lt;br&gt;
        Upon reaching this harmonious state, the Exalt invoking
        this Charm fires her weapon, and her shot zeros in
        on her target, trailing a brilliant comet's tail of flaming
        Essence. As the fireball closes in on its target, this ancient
        accounting begins to solve itself. The rings begin to align,
        starting with the innermost, and quickly rectify them-
        selves a hairbreadth moment before the martial artist's
        attack hits. In this perfect moment just before the Exalt's
        attack strikes the middle of the Abacus, time slows to an
        immeasurable halt.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist's target perceives the rectified rings
        about him shift their shape. A chorus of aquiline, cobalt
        cherubim, three to nine risers deep and awash in silver and
        golden flames begin to sing. The melody resonates at a very
        intimate level with the target, matching the harmonic
        frequency of his soul. Such a display can be very unsettling
        to those not prepared for it, and the players of those
        subjected must make a successful reflexive Willpower roll,
        difficulty 2, for their characters to do anything other than
        stare or scream in shocked terror as inescapable retribution
        comes calling. The martial artist spends 4 motes of Essence
        and one Willpower. So long as the target stays within the
        firing range of the martial artist's weapon, the attack cannot
        miss. Even if the character can move, the attack cannot be
        dodged by any means and can only be parried if the target has
        Charms that enable him to parry insubstantial attacks.

        With this Charm, the Exalt now has the ability to use
        a firewand or similar weapon in either hand without the
        &amp;quot;off-hand&amp;quot; penalty. The player spends 3 motes to activate
        this Charm.

        Martial artists knowledgeable of this Charm are deadly
        foes, especially in close quarters, with little to hide behind.
        Upon firing his weapon, the bolt of flame spits from the
        end of the barrel only to come to a shrieking halt a yard
        from the barrel-end of the firewand and, with a thunderous
        clap, explodes into a small winged creature that howls,
        spiraling toward its target. The player spends 4 motes and
        a point of temporary Willpower for his character to invoke
        the Charm. The player rolls for the martial artist to hit the
        first target. If the roll succeeds, he may immediately make
        a second roll to hit the same target or a second target, and
        so on. The Exalt may make as many attacks as he has points
        of permanent Essence, and each magma sprite does the
        base damage of the martial artist's weapon.

        &lt;br&gt;
        When invoking this Charm, the Celestial martial
        artist breathes deeply, tapping her inner reservoir of Essence,
        like bellows stoking a furnace. With each breath,
        she channels Essence through her weapon, using it as her
        focus. The Exalt can then fire a bolt of gossamer golden
        flame from his flamewand rather than needing firedust. So
        long as he has Essence to fuel it, he need never worry about
        running out of ammunition again.

        Duration: Varies&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Martial Arts: 5&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Phantom Flamebolt Prana&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        A master of this style has an acute and profound
        understanding into the nature of Essence. The invisible
        matrix of divine energy that tethers all of Creation into
        one whole, where concepts of space and distance do not
        exist, becomes evident and accessible to her.&lt;br&gt;
        When invoking this Charm, the martial artist attunes
        herself to the ambient lines of Essence, pulling them
        through her and focusing and filtering these energies
        through her righteous will. Essence trails can momentarily
        be seen radiating around her Caste Mark, tongues of
        Celestial fire and lightning writhe about her head and
        shoulders. The Exalt fires her weapon, and an Essence-
        enriched deluge of cobalt-and gold-flame engulfs her target.
        Any flammable items within the Exalt's Essence in yards
        around the target is incinerated to ash within seconds. The
        damage of the attack is aggravated, and the target is
        engulfed in flames for a number of turns equal to the Exalt's
        permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        After soaking the initial damage, the target's player
        must then make a reflexive Stamina + Resistance roll,
        difficulty 3, for his character. If the roll is successful, the
        target suffers a penalty equal to the martial artist's permanent
        Essence rating to all dice pools. If the roll fails, then
        the target can do nothing but writhe around on the
        ground in agony. The victim's player must make a Stamina
        + Resistance roll as a reflexive action every turn his
        character remains aflame in order to continue acting. For
        each turn the target remains on fire, he must soak the base
        damage of the martial artist's weapon. This damage is not
        aggravated. Also, his player must reroll the Stamina +
        Resistance roll at an additional + 1 difficulty for each turn
        after the first.
