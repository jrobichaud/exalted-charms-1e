        Wise Arrow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;

        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;

        Minimum Archery: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character extends her anima into the world around
        her, and joins archer, target and arrow into a single being. Truly,
        the arrow knows the way to the target, for that is its natural
        home. For each mote of Essence the player spends, he may add
        1 die to an Archery attack roll, but the number of bonus dice
        added to any single roll cannot exceed her normal Dexterity +
        Archery dice pool. The player must declare how much Essence
        she is going to use in this Charm prior to making the attack roll.&quot;

        Sight Without Eyes&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per die&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Wise Arrow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character opens her eyes not to the visual world,
        but to the world of Essence and senses her target in that
        fashion. She may make an Archery attack without penalty
        for visual conditions. Other negative modifiers (high winds,
        range and so forth) still impose their regular penalties.

        Accuracy Without Distance&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 5&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Sight Without Eyes&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character extends her sense of the local Essence flows
        to greater heights and can now shoot with perfect assurance. The
        character may make an Archery attack out to the maximum
        range of the bow with absolute certainty that the shot will hit.&lt;br&gt;
        The player rolls to attack as normal, but if he rolls insufficient
        successes for his character to hit the target, he still hits it, doing
        the arrow's base damage. This Charm can also be used to hit small
        objects, to cut cords and ropes and for other trick shots. It does not,
        however, allow the archer to negate their target's armor via a
        called shot to the eye, throat or what have you.

        Prerequisite Charms: Sight Without Eyes&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character's Essence flows into the bow and arrow, and he
        fires with a perfect, supple grace. The character may make a
        Archery attack without any environmental penalties of any sort,
        be they for range, high winds, bad weather, bad ammunition or
        what have you — the Charmed shot is absolutely flawless. Splitting
        a dice pool for multiple actions is not an environmental penalty.

        Trance of&lt;br&gt;Unhesitating Speed&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: Varies&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Extra Action&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Wise Arrow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character flows with soft and unhesitating grace
        through the motions of firing her weapon. Before the
        character takes her first action for the turn, the player must
        declare how many attacks the character will make this
        turn. Each extra attack costs a number of motes of Essence
        equal to twice the total number of attacks the character has
        made so far, including the attack the character is buying.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Harmonious Jade is surrounded by Dragon-Blooded
        hunters and needs to act now, regardless of cost. She uses
        the Trance of Unhesitating Speed to make three extra attacks (for
        a total of four attacks that turn). The cost is 18 motes of Essence;
        4 motes for the first extra attack, 6 motes for the second extra attack,
        and 8 motes for the third extra attack. The cost of the Charm must
        be paid before Harmonious Jade makes her first attack.&lt;br&gt;
        The player must decide how many attacks the character
        will make and pay for them all before he makes any
        attack rolls. Obviously, a character cannot attack more
        times than she has ammunition.
        &quot;

        Arrow Storm Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 8 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Extra Action&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 5&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Trance of Unhesitating Speed&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character's motions become smooth and economical,
        optimized for the release of arrows with a minimal
        expenditure of effort. So long as the character hits (she need
        not do damage) with an attack, she may make another attack
        immediately thereafter. Each attack must be at a different
        target, and the character cannot make more attacks than she
        has ammunition. This Charm ends when the character misses
        or when she has hit every possible target once.
        &quot;

    fiery_arrow_attack[Fiery Arrow Attack]
    click fiery_arrow_attack callback &quot;
        Fiery Arrow Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 2 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character concentrates Essence in an arrow and then
        launches it, causing it to burst into flame in mid-flight. Not only
        will the arrow ignite flammable materials it hits, it also adds dice
        equal to the character's Essence score to the arrow's damage.
        Arrows that have had the Fiery Arrow Attack Charm used on
        them are burnt to cinders and cannot be recovered. Keep in mind
        that indiscriminately firing burning arrows in a forest or grassland
        during the dry season is generally a bad idea.
        &quot;

    dazzling_flare_attack[Dazzling Flare Attack]
    fiery_arrow_attack --&gt; dazzling_flare_attack
    click dazzling_flare_attack callback &quot;
        Dazzling Flare Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per 2 damage&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Fiery Arrow Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character pours greater amounts of Essence into an
        arrow, and it roars and flashes with Essence as it streaks toward its
        target. The arrow flies faster and straighter than normal, adding
        one die to the character's Archery pool. Also, for every mote of
        Essence the character spends on the Charm, it adds two points
        to the base damage of the arrow. The Exalted cannot spend more
        motes of Essence activating this Charm than her permanent
        Essence rating. Characters using this Charm must spend at least
        one mote to do so — the Charm cannot be activated &amp;quot;for free&amp;quot;
        to gain the bonus die to the character's Archery pool.&lt;br&gt;
        As the Charm's name suggests, if fired on a high arc through
        the air, the arrow forms a beacon that can be seen for miles.
        Arrows that have had the Dazzling Flare Attack Charm used on
        them are burned to fine gray ash and cannot be recovered.

        Phantom Arrow Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per arrow&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Fiery Arrow Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The bane of the archer is his dependence on ammunition.
        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted can
        transcend the need for ammunition, at least while he
        possesses the Essence needed to power this Charm. As the
        character draws his bow, he shapes a mote of Essence into
        a glittering arrow. This arrow has normal range and damage,
        but winks out of existence a few seconds after impact.
        The Essence Arrow can be Comboed with Charms such as
        Dazzling Flare Attack or Rain of Feathered Death, allowing
        a character to conjure powerful attacks from thin air.
        &quot;

        Solar Spike&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per 2 dice of damage&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Archery: 4&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Phantom Arrow Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character pulls a blazing bolt of Essence across her
        bow. This is fired as a normal arrow, but does a base damage
        of twice the number of Essence motes that the character
        spent conjuring the Solar Spike. A character cannot spend
        more motes of Essence conjuring a Solar Spike than she
        has dots in the Archery Ability. The Solar Spike moves as
        quickly as a flash of lightning and is not subject to penalties
        for range or wind, though poor visibility can hamper
        shooting. A Solar Spike can be fired out to a distance of
        (the firing character's Essence * 100) yards.&lt;br&gt;
        Regardless of the target's soak, Solar Spikes that
        strike demons, undead and other creatures of the night
        will always roll at least as many dice of damage as the
        firing character's Essence. Solar Spike is not compatible
        with arrow-enhancing Charms such as Fiery Arrow
        Attack and Rain of Feathered Death. The damage of the
        Solar Spike is determined only by the amount of Essence
        the character spends on the bolt and the number
        of extra successes she rolls on her attack — do not add
        the damage of the bow.

        Prerequisite Charms: Phantom Arrow Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Exalted can not only substitute his Essence for
        ammunition, but for his weapon as well. Through this
        Charm, the character shapes Essence into a deadly bow. As
        an extension of the character's anima, each bow is unique
        to the Exalted who conjured it. All, however, have the
        same statistics - they do the character's Strength +
        Essence damage and have the range of a compound bow.
        The Immaculate Golden Bow does not come with ammunition,
        so characters without arrows will need to use
        Phantom Arrow Technique.

        The character bundles Essence tightly around the arrow as
        she fires, and as the shaft arcs toward the target, it is multiplied.
        Use one attack roll for all the arrows, but apply the damage from
        each of them separately. The character cannot create more
        duplicate arrows than her Essence score. All the arrows in the
        Rain of Feathered Death must attack the same target.

            Essence. This damage is aggravated. The bolt moves as
            quickly as a stroke of lightning. Its deadly power is not subject
            to penalties for range or wind, though poor visibility can
            hamper shooting. These bolts can be fired to a distance of
            (firing character's Essence x 100) yards.

            solar Essence that does the same base damage as any type of
            arrow she desires. These arrows are not subject to penalties
            for range or wind, though poor visibility can hamper shooting.

            ammunition, exceedingly difficult called shots or any other
            external factors. In addition, this shot has no range limitations.
            As long as the firing character can see the target, even if it is only
            a tiny dot near the horizon, the shot can hit this distant goal. If
            the character enhances her sight with a Charm such as Unsurpassed
            Sight Discipline (see Exalted, page 196), she can
            literally shoot the hat off of the head of a target five miles away.
            As with the Charm There Is No Wind, splitting a dice pool for
            multiple actions is not considered an environmental penalty.

        The character infuses his anima with Essence, making
        his strikes much more damaging. On a successful attack,
        the character may count his extra successes twice for the
        purposes of determining damage. The Essence for this
        Charm may be spent after the character rolls the attack.

        The character suffuses her fists with Essence, hardening
        them into deadly weapons. Until her next action, her
        hand-to-hand strikes do lethal damage, and she can safely parry
        lethal damage blows with her hands. However, she is no
        faster than normal and so, generally, cannot parry incoming
        arrows or magical attacks without a well-described stunt.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character concentrates her anima around her fist
        and smashes it into her enemy, stunning and disorienting
        him. The character makes a normal attack with her Dexterity
        + Brawl. If successful, the attack does no normal
        damage but, instead, does a base of one point of stunning
        damage for every mote spent on the Charm. This stunning
        damage is soaked as bashing damage, but can only be
        soaked with the target's Stamina. Extra successes on the
        attack add to damage as usual. However, rather than doing
        health levels of damage, each success on the damage roll
        imposes a -1 penalty to the target's dice pools for a number
        of turns equal to (7 - the target's Stamina).&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalted using this Charm cannot spend more
        motes of Essence to power this Charm than twice his
        Strength, and the Storyteller may rule that certain types of
        opponents (mechanical constructs, shambling corpses or
        giant man-eating trees, for example) are too sturdy or
        insensible to be stunned by the character's mighty blows.

        Prerequisite Charms: Fists of Iron Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character may wrap his opponents in his mighty
        arms and crush the very life from them. The character makes
        a clinch attack as normal, but the attack does the character's
        Strength + Essence + 2 in lethal damage, while the subject of
        the clinch does only the normal Strength + 2 bashing. If the
        target attempts to escape the clinch, the character performing
        the Dragon Coil Technique may add his Essence in automatic
        successes to the reflexive roll to resist the escape attempt.&lt;br&gt;
        If the target also has Dragon Coil Technique, she may
        choose to activate it as her action on subsequent turns and
        do her Strength + Essence + 2 in lethal damage as well.
        Maintaining this Charm over multiple turns prevents the
        character from using simple and supplemental Charms but
        does not prevent the use of reflexive defensive Charms.
        This Charm is not compatible with Hammer on Iron
        Technique or other Charms of the extra action type and
        cannot be placed in Combos with them.

        The character pours Essence into quickening her
        motions and rushes aggressively toward her enemy. She
        automatically wins initiative over a single opponent.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot split their dice pools on the turn they
        use Thunderclap Rush Attack. Two characters using
        Thunderclap Rush Attack in competition roll for initiative normally.

        The character suffuses his body with Essence, turning
        him into a virtual killing machine, with arms like pounding
        triphammers. He gains a number of additional attacks
        equal to his Essence but must make all his attacks against
        the same target. Hammer on Iron Technique cannot be
        Comboed with defensive Charms that allow the character
        to dodge or otherwise avoid attacks, but may be combined
        with those that allow her to soak or ignore damage.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character can suffuse his body with Essence,
        concentrating his anima until it is a crackling nimbus
        around him, and become capable of great destruction. This
        Charm must be used to attack inanimate objects and
        doubles the amount of damage the character does after
        extra successes are added but before the object's soak is
        applied. This increase in Strength does not add directly to
        combat damage, though it may assist the character in
        causing indirect damage (for example, by causing a tower
        to collapse on top of his opponent).

        The character tightly focuses his anima, making him
        able to apply his Strength more effectively. In addition to
        doing normal damage, the character also throws his opponent
        on a successful attack. The target is hurled a number
        of yards equal to the character's Strength + his extra
        successes on the attack roll. This attack cannot be blocked,
        only dodged. A target who strikes a solid object takes dice
        of damage equal to the number of yards she would have
        continued flying had the object not been in the way. This
        damage is typically bashing but can be lethal if (for
        example) the object is covered in sharp steel spikes.
        Obviously, the target can also suffer serious injury if she is
        tossed over a cliff or off a ship at sea.

        unarmed attacks do normal damage, they also hurl his
        opponents great distances. For each health level of damage
        he inflicts before soak, the target is hurled backward a yard,

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character burns with Essence, increasing her
        strength and agility to superhuman levels. She seizes one
        opponent and picks him up bodily, using him to strike
        another foe. The character makes one attack roll against the
        primary target. The attack cannot be blocked, only dodged.
        If successful, this attack does no damage, but the attacker
        may immediately make a reflexive Brawl attack at her full
        dice pool against another target within hand-to-hand range.&lt;br&gt;
        If the second attack is successful, both the targets take
        bashing damage equal to the character's Strength + the
        extra successes on the Exalted's reflexive attack. The second
        target may parry or dodge to reduce damage or avoid the
        attack, but if the attack is parried, the character being used
        as a club takes bashing damage equal to the Strength of the
        Exalted swinging him around + the number of successes the
        parrying character rolled to block the attacks.&lt;br&gt;
        If the Exalted hits with her second attack, both targets are
        left in a heap on the ground and must spend an action to return
        to their feet. If the second attack misses, the character being
        used as a club is hurled a number of yards equal to the Exalted's
        Strength, in a direction of the Exalted's choice, as if he had been
        successfully attacked with the Crashing Wave Throw Charm.

            With greater skill and Essence comes greater power and
            control. This Charm allows the character to precisely gauge the
            amount of damage he is causing. Punches enhanced by this
            Charm cannot accidentally do lethal damage to the target. If the
            player rolls more health levels of damage than the target has
            remaining health levels, all remaining damage is ignored. If the
            damage rolled is insufficient to knock out the target, then the
            attacker can roll additional dice in an attempt to do enough
            damage to knock the target out. The character may buy
            additional damage dice at 2 motes per die. These dice are bought
            and rolled one at a time as a Reflexive Action, and a character
            can continue buying and rolling them for as long as he can pay
            for them. A character cannot buy dice to gain additional damage
            levels beyond those required to knock out the target.&lt;br&gt;
            Characters can easily run out of Essence if they use this
            Charm repeatedly. If a character runs out of Essence while
            using this Charm, count all damage dice that have been paid
            for. This Charm cannot be used if the character is wielding
            Tiger Claws or any other weapon or magical effect that
            causes his punches to do lethal damage.

            character's blow does lethal damage. In addition, when used
            against a living target, this Charm adds a bonus to the base
            damage of the attack equal to the attacking character's Permanent
            Essence. However, this Charm is far more effective when
            used against inanimate targets. If the character attacks an
            inanimate object, add a number of damage levels equal to four
            times the attacking character's Permanent Essence. A single
            such punch or kick can knock down a sturdy oak door or break
            a hole in a ship's hull large enough to walk through.

            Permanent Essence to all Brawling attacks. When this Charm is
            performed, the caster can also specify whether these attacks will
            do bashing or lethal damage. Using this Charm, the character can

        totals and his bashing soak. Also, his sinuous, hypnotic
        movements slow and distract enemies. Enemies attacking
        him subtract a number of dice from their pool equal to the
        Exalted's Essence. This latter effect only works if the target
        can see the characters movements — a blind opponent
        would be unfazed by this aspect of Snake Form. This
        Charm is incompatible with the use of armor.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot use more than one Martial Arts
        Form-type Charm at a time. Snake Form is the only Form-type
        Charm in the Exalted book, but more Martial Arts
        styles will be introduced in later supplements.

        Thought training and the use of Essence, the character
        learns to harden her fingers into talons, like the fangs of a
        striking snake. Likewise, she can toughen her skin until it is
        as strong and supple as snake's skin. For the rest of the scene,
        the character's Martial Arts attacks do lethal damage, and
        she soaks lethal damage with her bashing soak total. This
        Charm is incompatible with the use of armor or weapons.

        The character can harden her fingers to the degree

        trauma merely by the intensity of their Essence. The
        character's attack ignores the soak of the target's armor
        and can be soaked only by the target's Stamina.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Like the snake, the Exalted defends herself by attacking.
        Whenever she is successfully attacked, the character
        may immediately (before damage is determined) make a
        Martial Arts counterattack with a dice pool equal to her
        Martial Arts Ability plus the attacker's extra successes on
        his attack. The damage from her opponent's attack and her
        own counterstrike is applied simultaneously. Snake Strikes
        the Heel cannot be used to retaliate against Solar Counter-
        attack or any other counterattack Charm.

        The character makes a Martial Arts attack as normal,
        including the roll for damage. However, the attack
        does no actual damage. Rather, for every health level
        the character would have inflicted, her target is at a -1
        penalty to all rolls for a number of turns equal to the
        Martial Arts of the Exalted who used the Crippling
        Pressure-Point Strike.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character infuses his anima with Essence and
        lashes out, his anima flashing forward like a striking snake.
        The Exalted may invoke this Charm and make a Martial
        Arts attack a number of yards away equal to his Essence.
        The character's anima actually strikes the target, so there
        must be a clear path to the target, and the character must
        be able to perceive the target well enough to attack.

        The character internalizes the reflexes and raw speed
        of a coiled snake. The player rolls the Exalted's Martial
        Arts Ability, and for every success, she may take an extra
        action during the turn. This extra action need not be an
        attack. A character may not split her dice pool during the
        round she uses Striking Serpent Speed.

        The character concentrates her Essence on the tips of
        two fingers, making her attack as quick as lightning and as
        deadly as the strike of a dozen serpents. The character
        invokes the Charm and makes a Martial Arts attack as
        normal, but adds her Essence score to the damage of the
        attack. The attack does aggravated damage.

            blows do lethal damage even if she is not wearing tiger claws. Ifshe

            Tiger Form, he adds his Martial Arts score to his damage when
            making Martial Arts attacks and adds his Permanent Essence
            to his bashing and lethal soak totals. The damage bonus applies
            only if the character is attacking barehanded or wearing tiger
            claws. Also, the character's Martial Arts attacks automatically
            do lethal damage even if he is not wearing tiger claws, and the
            character suffers no penalties for fighting while prone. This

            with tiger claws. For each additional mote of Essence spent

            attack, up to a limit of double the character's regular Dexter-
            ity + Melee dice pool. The attacker's hands leave deep
            furrows in the target; they can even claw through wooden or

            Like the tiger, the Exalted can stealthily stalk her prey.

            add one die to all Stealth and Awareness rolls involved in the
            ambush for every two motes of Essence spent activating this
            Charm. The effects persist until the character ambushes her
            target or she is detected. The character cannot spend more
            motes to increase her dice pool than she has points of
            Permanent Essence. This Charm only works when a character
            is actually sneaking up on an opponent; no bonuses are
            gained if the character is attempting to sneak away from

            The Exalted can spring from cover with the deadly force
            of a tiger leaping onto the back of an unsuspecting gazelle.
            When attacking a target unaware of the Exalted character's
            presence, the target's lethal or bashing soak score is halved
            before the raw damage of the attack is applied. If the target
            knows the attacker's location, or is aware of an impending
            attack, this Charm does not function. A target's successful use
            of the Surprise Anticipation Method (see Exalted, p. 197)

            Burning with the passion of an enraged tiger, the character
            can lash out in a rain of deadly blows. A character using this
            Charm may make two attacks every turn, so longas she uses her
            Martial Arts ability. In addition, whenever she is successfully
            attacked, the character may immediately (before damage is
            determined) make a Martial Arts counterattack with a dice
            pool equal to her Martial Arts ability plus the attacker's extra
            successes from his attack. The damage from the opponent's
            attack and his own counterstrike are applied simultaneously.
            This Charm cannot be used to retaliate against any other
            counterattack Charm. Each blow does lethal damage even if
            the attacking character is not wearing tiger claws. If desired, a
            full parry or full dodge can be substituted for one or both of the
            character's two normal actions. However, the character can-
            not split any of these dice pools to obtain further multiple
            actions. This Charm is incompatible with armor. A character
            using Angry Predator Frenzy Style cannot use any other Extra
            Actions-type Charms while this Charm is active.

            appear to be dead. The instant she performs this Charm,
            she falls to the ground, seemingly deceased. A careful
            examination and a successful Perception + Medicine roll
            of difficulty 3 is necessary to determine that the character
            is actually still alive. While this Charm is in effect, the
            character can hold her breath 10 times as long as normal,
            and she does not need to eat of drink. Although the
            character can use her senses of hearing, touch and smell
            normally, she cannot see or move while this Charm is in
            effect. However, she can act normally the turn after she
            chooses to end this Charm.

            The character using this Charm can climb walls,
            ropes, chains and other vertical surfaces as easily as he can
            walk along a floor. Using Wall Climbing Technique, the
            character can climb up to his normal movement rate per
            turn. In his next turn, the character must either activate
            the Charm again, remain where he is (if such is possible)
            or attempt to leap or climb down normally.

            The character can make a complex sign with her
            fingers and charge it with Essence. This sign distracts and
            slows a single opponent. It takes only an instant to make
            and is performed at the beginning of the turn. The
            character's Martial Arts score is subtracted from a single
            opponent's initiative roll, and the Charm prevents this
            opponent from splitting her dice pool that turn (although
            the opponent may use Combos and reflexive and extra
            action Charms normally and may abort to dodge or parry
            as usual). If, for any reason, the opponent's initiative roll
            is reduced below 1, the opponent may not act that turn.

            The Exalt moves with the speed and ease of a
            flickering shadow While using the Ebon Shadow Form,
            she adds her Martial Arts score to her initiative total. In
            addition, she adds a number of dice equal to her permanent
            Essence to her Stealth score, and the difficulty of
            all attacks against the character is increased by a number
            equal to the character's permanent Essence. The character
            can also decide whether any of her attacks made with
            hands, feet, sai or fighting chains will do bashing or
            lethal damage. This decision must be made before a
            given attack is rolled. This Charm is incompatible with
            armor. Characters cannot use more than one Martial
            Arts Form-type Charm at a time. If a character is killed
            while under the effects of Ebon Shadow Form, her body
            dissipates into acrid black smoke. She leaves no ghost,
            and her physical remains provide no evidence of her
            identity (though her gear may).

            The character uses her Essence to guide her hand,

            target's armor. As a result, a number of points equal to the
            character's Martial Arts score are subtracted from the
            target's lethal or bashing soak before damage from this
            attack is applied.

            A character trained in the Ebon Shadow Style learns
            all of the weak points found in living bodies. With a slight
            touch, the martial artist can immobilize one of her target's
            limbs. The character need merely tap an unsuspecting
            target, a normal unarmed attack at +1 difficulty. The
            attack can be blocked or dodged as normal and does no
            damage. The attacker can choose which limb is paralyzed,
            and the target limb is immobilized for the remainder of
            the scene. Immobilizing a human's leg halves his movement
            speed, and the target's player must make a reflexive
            Dexterity + Athletics roll every time his character is
            struck to keep him from falling. Characters with both legs
            immobilized can only crawl and must generally perform
            stunts to attack, dodge or parry. Immobilizing the leg of a
            horse or other animal with four or more legs merely halves
            the distance it can move every turn. Immobilizing an arm
            keeps the target from using that arm to attack. This attack
            does no actual damage to the target, but it may cause off-
            hand penalties, and paralyzing both the target's arms
            makes it very difficult for him to fight effectively. This
            attack has no effect against the undead, automata and
            other beings that have no vital functions to obstruct.

            This Charm allows the character to stun or incapacitate
            a target with a mere touch to one of the five vital
            centers. To perform this attack, the character must lightly
            tap the target on one of several possible nerve points,
            making a normal unarmed attack. This attack does no
            damage. However, the Exalt's player may roll a number of
            dice equal to her character's Martial Arts + the number of
            extra successes she made on the attack, against a difficulty
            equal to the target's Essence. Each extra success on this
            roll reduces the target's Dexterity.by one dot. If the.
            target's Dexterity is reduced to zero, he is paralyzed. Lost
            Dexterity returns at the end of the scene. The effect is also
            dispersed if the player of a character with Medicine and
            Martial Arts at 3 or higher makes a successful Wits +
            Martial Arts roll at difficulty 3 to remove the paralysis.
            Removing paralysis is a normal dice action, and the target
            may move normally in the next turn. With a successful
            Wits + Stealth roll of difficulty 1, this touch can be made
            to seem like a simple pat on a shoulder or an unintentional
            push. This attack cannot be used against the undead or
            other beings that lack vital centers.

            dodge or parry the character's blow without the use of
            Charms. The target's player may make a reflexive Wits +
            Awareness roll for the attack, with a difficulty equal to the
            attacking character's Essence. If the roll succeeds, the
            opponent may use any reflexive Charms or abilities she
            possesses to counter the attack but may not avoid it
            nonmagically. If the roll fails, the opponent may use only
            Charms that specifically state they work on attacks the
            - character is not aware of. This Charm may explicitly be
            used in a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

            This Charm allows the character to flatten her body in
            order to pass through narrow spaces as easily as a shadow
            slides under a door. The character can fit her entire body
            through any space wide enough for her to fit her fingers
            through. The character is shadowy and indistinct, composed
            of tangible darkness and not flesh. It is impossible to identify
            the character while this Charm is in effect, though her gear
            may betray her. Even if her anima banner activates, only her
            Caste Mark will shine forth, and her anima banner, while
            bright as usual, will be muted and generic.&lt;br&gt;
            The Exalt cannot wear any armor when using this
            Charm, but she adds a number of dice equal to her
            permanent Essence to both her lethal and bashing soaks
            while the Charm is in effect. This Charm is incompatible
            with any other Charms that increase the character's
            natural soak and have durations longer than Instant. A
            character using this Charm sees as easily in total darkness
            as in light, though she must actually use her eyes to see,
            and so, this magic lends no aid if she must fight blind-
            folded or in thick fog.

            In ancient times, Exalted assassins circumvented the
            protections of their enemies by stepping directly through
            them. By using this Charm, the Exalt steps into a shadow
            and steps out of another shadow far away, near his desti-
            nation. The Exalt must have a shadow to step into, and he
            must have seen his destination before, though seeing it
            through a familiar, sorcerous scrying or what have you
            also counts. The Exalt then steps into the shadow as a
            simple action. He reappears at the beginning of next tum
            in the nearest unobserved shadow near his intended
            destination. That destination cannot be more than a
            number of miles away equal to the Exalt's permanent
            Essence, and if there are no unobserved shadows within
            100 yards of that location, the Charm fails (though the
            Essence and Willpower are still spent).&lt;br&gt;
            There are certain sorcerous wards (the same as those
            that will block teleportation, which is what this Charm
            is) that prevent the use of this Charm. Generally, it
            cannot penetrate the Manse of a sorcerer, a god's sanctum
            or any other such forbidden place.

            may be used to block multiple attacks. The dice pool
            of a cascading parry is reduced by 1 per successive
            parry attempt, as per a full dodge. The character's
            unarmed Martial Arts attacks also do lethal damage.
            Characters cannot use more than one Martial Arts

            Charm immediately negates the effects of the first.
            This Charm is incompatible with the use of armor.

        The Exalted fills her weapon with crackling Essence,

        To activate the Hungry Tiger Technique, the Exalted
        charges her body and weapon with Essence, unifying the
        two and making her attack as if the weapon were an
        extension of her being. If the attack is successful, the player
        counts the extra successes twice for the purposes of determining
        damage. The Essence to power this Charm must be
        spent prior to making the attack roll.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character focuses her Essence into her weapon and
        swings a terrible blow against her opponent. If the blow is
        successful, the character's attack does an additional die of
        damage against her opponent for every mote of Essence she
        spent activating the Charm. Characters cannot spend more
        Essence activating Fire and Stones Strike than they have
        dots of Strength. Note that the Essence cost of Fire and
        Stones Strike must be spent before the attack roll. If a
        non-orichalcum weapon is used to do more automatic damage
        successes than its damage rating, it will probably break.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Errata:&lt;br&gt;
        This one is entertainingly confusing. Clearly, nazi ninja frogmen secretly altered the manuscript.
        For every mote you spend on Fire and Stones strike, one of your damage dice will not be rolled, it will be
        an automatic success. It does not add to the damage of the attack, it merely takes what would normally be
        dice rolled for damage and converts them to automatic successes. This is a wager – if you do less dice of
        damage than you paid the conversion cost on, you have wasted the Essence. Obviously, if you can hit them
        at all while using this Charm, you will generally do at least one Health Level of damage, since all
        successful attacks do 1 die of damage. If the opponent is protected by Invulnerable Skin of Bronze or
        something else that completely defends against wimpy attacks, and you throw a wimpy attack at them, you
        will not do an automatic health level.

        The Exalted charges her weapon arm with Essence,
        and it becomes as fast as a striking snake. The character
        may attack a target twice in one turn. The attacks both
        occur on the character's initiative, but each is rolled
        separately. If the defender attempts to dodge or parry, one
        roll is made and the results are applied to both attacks.

        The Exalted surrounds herself with a nimbus of Essence,
        and her movements become as rapid and smooth as
        ice on hot metal. The character may make multiple attacks,
        either against multiple targets or a single opponent.
        The character may attack as many times as she likes, so
        long as she has sufficient Essence to fuel the Charm. Each
        attack costs motes of Essence equal to the twice the total
        number of attacks the character has made that turn,
        including his normal attack. A character making 5 attacks
        would pay 28 (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) motes of Essence to activate
        the Peony Blossom Attack.&lt;br&gt;
        The player must declare how many attacks the character
        will make this turn before the character takes her first
        action. The character cannot split her Melee dice pool and
        use this Charm in the same turn, so a Combo with some
        sort of defensive Charm is recommended. Defenders must
        dodge or parry each attack separately.

        defeat doors, chains and other such substantial hindrances.
        The character must have his weapon hand empty and must be

        hand. The character attacks with his Melee pool, as usual, and
        the damage is determined using his Strength as if it was anormal
        Melee attack. Iron Raptor attacks can be blocked like normal
        Melee attacks. Botched Iron Raptor attacks can result in stuck
        or lost weapons or injury to the Exalted using the Charm.

        The character charges his weapon with Essence and
        strikes a blow at a distant target. A slashing edge of concentrated
        force leaps from the weapon and races toward the target.&lt;br&gt;
        The character attacks with his Dexterity + Melee dice pool and
        does a base lethal damage of his Strength + his Essence. The
        Sandstorm-Wind Attack is blocked as a ranged attack, not as
        a Melee attack. Sandstorm-Wind Attack can strike characters
        up to (10 x the character's Essence) yards away.

        becomes invested with Solar power and is highly effective
        against creatures of darkness, the undead and the Abyssal
        Exalted. The weapon adds the character's Essence to its
        regular damage when used against such creatures.

        The character channels Essence through her body, using
        her weapon as an aggressive focus. Her flesh coruscates with
        flickering Solar energy, and attacks against her by undead,
        creatures of the night and Abyssal Exalted are at + 1 difficulty.
        In addition, if such creatures strike her without using a
        weapon, they must soak aggravated damage equal to the
        character's Essence. While Corona of Radiance is active, the
        Exalted's attacks against such creatures do aggravated damage
        and have a damage bonus equal to the character's Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Errata:&lt;br&gt;
        The description of this Charm mentions the Charm “Solar Blaze”. That’s what Corona of Radiance was

        The character channels pure Solar Essence though herself,
        focusing it with her will and through the medium of her
        weapon. A powerful lance of energy leaps between the Solar's
        Caste Mark, her weapon and the target. The character makes
        an attack with her Dexterity + Melee dice pool, which cannot
        be blocked or dodged without the use of Charms. The attack
        does lethal damage and has a base damage of the Exalted's
        Strength + her Willpower. Against inhabitants of Malfeas and
        the Underworld, Blazing Solar Bolt inflicts aggravated damage.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through this Charm, the character uses Essence to guide
        her weapon on the defense, allowing her to parry the attacks
        of many foes at once. The character may trade Essence for dice
        to block any hand-to-hand attack that she is aware of, at the
        cost of 1 mote per 2 dice. The player cannot use more dice to
        parry any single attack than her Melee dice pool. If there are
        an odd number of dice in her Melee pool, then the fractional
        mote left over after buying the last die is lost.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Errata:&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is an exception to the general Ability + Attribute rule. When using Golden Essence Block, you
        can’t make your dice pool exceed your normal parry pool (Dexterity + Melee + whatever bonuses you may
        have lying around from the weapon or your specialties). It’s most efficient in parrying multiple extra
        attackers where a couple parry dice is all you need. If combined with something like Dipping Swallow
        Defense it proves very useful for parrying the attacks of Exalts as well. For more on reflexive Charms that
        give you extra dice and how they combine with reflexive Charms that give you full parries and dodges, see
        the “Dice Pool Maximums” entry in the Technical Rules Clarifications section of this document.

        The character has achieved further mastery of defensive
        Essence flows and can now more smoothly block
        attacks. Dipping Swallow Defense allows the character to
        use his full Dexterity + Melee dice pool to parry any one
        incoming hand-to-hand attack that he is aware of.

        The character now has the ability to use defensive

        next action, the character may use her full Dexterity +
        Melee dice pool to parry any attack she is aware of, so long
        as the attack has a physical component and is not specifically
        noted as being impossible to block.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character may block, without his player rolling, any
        one attack against him that he is aware of, even if the attack
        is not normally blockable, such as that from an arrow, a bolt
        of acid or a hurtling boulder. Blocking the tremendously
        powerful attacks of beings such as godlings and demon princes
        will almost certainly cause non-magical weapons to perish,
        but the attack will be stopped at no harm to the Exalted.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Errata:&lt;br&gt;
        It says this can block unblockable attacks &amp;quot;including those from arrows&amp;quot;, implying that you normally can’t,
        when the Drama chapter clearly states you can. This is a holdover from earlier versions of the rules, when
        Archery attacks were harder to block. Heavenly Guardian Defense can still block pretty much any sort of
        physical attack, it’s just arrows aren’t anything special anymore.

        and guiding his weapon in defense. The character may use

        against him of which he is aware, even missile weapons and
        magical attacks that possess a physical component.

        Essence guides the character's tempo, allowing her
        to strike when her enemy extends for an attack. The
        character may immediately make an attack at her full
        Dexterity + Melee dice pool against anyone executing a
        hand-to-hand attack against her. This attack is made
        after the roll to hit the counterattacking Exalted but
        before damage is determined.&lt;br&gt;
        The Solar Counterattack is not an action and does
        not subtract from the character's dice pools or affect her
        action for the turn. A character can make as many Solar
        Counterattacks in a turn as she can afford to pay for, but a
        character cannot use Solar Counterattack in response to
        Solar Counterattack or any other counterattack Charm.

        The character now rides the impulses of Essence
        with supple perfection. To attack him is to invite a lethal
        counterstroke. Until the character's next action, he may
        respond to all incoming hand-to-hand attacks with an
        immediate counterattack at his full Dexterity + Melee
        dice pool. As with Solar Counterattack, Ready in Eight
        Directions Stance comes after the opponent's attack roll
        but before damage effects are applied. Ready in Eight
        Directions Stance in no way mitigates the attack's effects.
        A character cannot use Ready in Eight Directions
        Stance in response to Solar Counterattack or any other
        counterattack Charm.

            to all opponents. Add the character's permanent Essence to the
            weapon's damage for the rest of the scene. Any weapon save one
            of exceptional quality will fall to pieces after the end of this scene,
            and only weapons made of the Five Magical Materials can stand
            up to repeated uses of this Charm. A character can benefit from
            the effects of only one application of this Charm at a time.

            even if the attack is not normally blockable (like a bolt of acid
            or a hurtling boulder). Blocking even a single strong attack by
            a powerful spirit or a Yozi will cause any non-magical weapons
            to perish, but the Charm will blunt the attack at no harm to the
            blocking character. Characters wielding magical weapons can
            parry any number of incredibly powerful attacks without risk.

            two weapons for an entire scene. He may use either
            weapon to perform any combat action without penalty.
            This does not allow him to take extra actions as if he
            were using Charms, but he may split his dice pool
            normally. In addition, this Charm completely eliminates
            the off-hand penalty and also allows the character
            to sacrifice an action for the turn make a &amp;quot;cascading
            parry.&amp;quot; This consumes both his actions for the turn. The
            cascading parry's dice pool starts at the Exalt's Dexterity
            nt Melee + the sum of the two weapons' defensive
            bonuses and drops by 1 for each successive parry at-
            tempt. A character using Two Swords Technique can

                &lt;br&gt;
                The character enfolds himself in Essence, allowing it
                to guide his actions as he whirls through a breathtakingly
                graceful whirlwind of deadly blows. So long as he has
                weapons in both hands, a character who has activated this
                Charm is an incredibly deadly opponent.&lt;br&gt;
                Whenever the character is attacked, he may make a
                reflexive automatic parry attempt with whichever of his
                weapons he chooses at his Dexterity + Melee + any other
                modifiers. In addition, he may reflexively counterattack
                any hand-to-hand attack with whichever of his weapons
                he chooses. This counterattack is rolled after the auto-
                matic parry, and if the automatic parry is successful, extra
                successes on the parry attempt are added as bonus dice to
                the counterattack roll.&lt;br&gt;
                The parry and the counterattack are &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; ac-
                tions for the character, and so, the character could
                enhance his counterattacks with Excellent Strike or his
                defense with Golden Essence Block, but the character
                still cannot invoke the effects of more than one different
                Charm per turn without a Combo. In addition, a char-
                acter under the effects of this Charm may not use or
                benefit from extra action Charms, nor may he use or
                benefit from any effect that causes him to make another
                parry or another riposte. The counterattack bonus dice
                added by extra successes on the parry attempt are a
                Charm bonus and count against the character's At-
                tribute + Ability maximum for bonus dice if he uses
                other Charms to enhance the riposte. The counterattack
                effect of Steel Devil Style cannot be used in response
                to other counterattack effects, but the automatic parry is
                still active against these attacks.&lt;br&gt;
                In order to use this Charm, the character must have
                weapons in both hands. If the character is no longer
                using two weapons, he loses access to the Charm's
                effects, though he can use them again the instant he is
                rearmed. A character under this Charm's effects who no
                longer has a weapon in either hand is still unable to
                activate extra action, full parry or riposte Charms while
                disarmed and must terminate the Charm's eftects (this
                can- be done reflexively and does nor require dice or
                count as an action) in order to permit these types of
                effects to work on him.

        The character infuses her thrown weapon, be it a
        hatchet, knife or shuriken, with Essence, coming to a
        perfect understanding of the weapon's balance and behavior
        at the moment of release. For each mote of Essence
        spent, the player may add 1 die to a Thrown attack roll but
        cannot more than double her character's dice pool. The
        player must declare how much Essence she is going to use
        in this Charm prior to making the attack roll.

        The character attacks, not only to do damage, but to
        stun or cripple his opponent. The character attacks and
        damage is rolled as normal. However, for every health level
        of damage the attack inflicts, the target suffers a -1 penalty
        to all dice pools related to physical activity until the end
        of the scene. It is up to the player and Storyteller to
        describe how this is inflicted - it could be an injured
        hand, slashed tendons or a stunning blow to the head.
        While a very small number of creatures (such as animated
        statues of solid iron or marble) might be unaffected by this
        attack, it works on automata, the undead and so forth.
        Storytellers will have to work with players to help describe
        the attacks' adverse effects on more exotic opponents.

        This deadly Charm is the friend of assassins everywhere.
        The Exalted charges her weapon with Essence and strikes from
        surprise. The defender applies soak, and the attacker's player
        rolls for damage as normal, but doubles the number of successes
        when determining damage. This Charm amplifies the natural
        shock of a surprise attack and must be used from ambush — it
        has no effect when used against an alerted opponent.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The art of thrown weapons is an art often practiced by
        assassins and others who attack from ambush. Through the use
        of this Charm, the character can mislead his target (or his
        target's avengers) as to his location, buying him a chance to
        escape or giving him a chance to make further attacks. The
        Exalted makes an attack as normal, gaining no special bonuses
        to attack or damage. However, attacks made using this Charm
        appear to have been made from a totally different direction. For
        example, a character attacking her target from behind might
        inflict a wound to the chest or side. Obviously, the sight of the
        character actually hurling the knife will ruin the effect, but the
        difficulty of the Awareness roll to spot the attacker is raised by
        one (or more, at the Storyteller's discretion).

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character strikes his unsuspecting opponent with a
        weapon imbued with Essence, stifling her outcry and muting
        the sensory impressions of the attack. The character may
        impose silence on the attack for up to a number of turns equal
        to his Essence score, but he must pay 3 motes per turn of silence.&lt;br&gt;
        If the target is killed outright by the attack, her death willnot
        be noticed for a number of turns equal to the length of the silence.
        She will stand upright even though already dead, circumstances
        will conspire to make her companions look away and assume she
        us still alive, and so forth. If the target is still alive, she may react
        to the attack normally, but she cannot speak or otherwise raise
        an alarm for a number of turns equal to the silence's length.&lt;br&gt;
        Obviously, someone seeing the target fighting is likely
        to draw some obvious conclusions regardless of whether she
        can speak or not. This Charm amplifies the natural shock of
        a surprise attack and must be used from ambush — it has no
        effect when used against an alerted opponent. It's left up to
        the Storyteller's discretion as to what qualifies as &amp;quot;alerted&amp;quot;.

        The character imbues her arm and weapon with
        Essence, lightening the weapon at the moment of launch
        and correcting for tiny errors in aim. The weapon's range
        is tripled for the purposes of determining penalties based
        on distance to the target.

        The character hurls dozens or even hundreds of Essence
        duplicates of his favored throwing weapon, saturating
        an area with countless attacks. The character doubles his
        Thrown pool for the purposes of the attack, which cannot
        be dodged, only blocked. This attack effects only a single
        individual. However, it can be used for utility purposes —
        for example, to clear tree branches and undergrowth from
        the façade of an overgrown stepped pyramid or to ruin the
        rigging of a ship. The thrown weapons fade away a few
        seconds after impact. The character need not have any
        actual copies of the weapon he is conjuring.

        thrown at one or several targets without penalty. The
        character cannot hurl more weapons than his Essence score and
        must have enough ammunition. If this Charm is Comboed
        with supplemental Charms, the cost of the supplemental
        Charms must be paid for every weapon the character hurls.

        successes the character rolls on his attack and has a range of
        100 yards. Against demons, ghosts or other creatures of the
        night, the character may add a number of automatic successes
        to her attack roll equal to her Essence score.

            The character can bounce any thrown weapon off of an
            object and have it hit its intended target without penalty.
            Each additional ricochet increases the cost of the Charm by
            one mote of Essence. Bouncing a weapon of off a wall behind
            a target normally allows the character to hit her target from
            behind, denying the target the protection of cover or shields.
            Multiple ricochets can even allow the character to hit targets
            hiding around corners. When using this Charm, rolls to hit
            targets that the character cannot see are at + 1 difficulty if the
            target's exact position is known, or at difficulty +2 if the
            character is aiming by sound or intuition.

            Once thrown, a weapon using this Charm continues to
            strike targets for the duration of the scene. Bouncing off of
            trees, walls, targets and the ground, the weapon makes one
            attack on a target each turn. Once the weapon is in motion, the
            attacking character need not worry about it, and can act
            normally without any penalty. When the weapon is thrown,
            the character must decide whom it will attempt to strike each
            turn. This choice cannot be changed once made, and the
            weapon cannot be recalled once set in motion. If a target dies
            or moves out of range, the weapon continues on to its next
            target. Each attack is made at the attacking character's normal
            Thrown dice pool, at the character's initiative for the turn.&lt;br&gt;
            This Charm ends if the caster flees or dies, or once the
            weapon has failed to inflict damage on a number of attacks
            equal to the attacker's Permanent Essence score. Such failure
            may stem from the target's dodge or parry or because the
            weapon struck successfully but did no damage. The weapon
            can be attacked at difficulty 4; if successfully struck, it is
            batted from the air and its deadly rampage ends. If an attack
            roll for the weapon botches, the weapon strikes an unintended
            target — a person or an object — and the Charm
            fades. If the Charm is used on several successive turns, a
            character can fill the air around him with deadly blades.

            wound to its owner's hand. Using this Charm, a character need

            botch on any Thrown roll prevents that weapon from returning.

        The bodies of the Exalted are far more durable than
        those of mere mortals. To help simulate this, an Exalted may
        buy extra health levels as if they were a Charm. A player may
        purchase this Charm up to once per dot of the Endurance
        Ability his character possesses. Each Ox-Body Technique
        Charm purchased can provide one of the following, at the
        player's option, determined at the time of purchase:&lt;br&gt;
        • One -0 health level&lt;br&gt;
        • Two -1 health levels&lt;br&gt;
        • One -1 health level and two -2 health levels&lt;br&gt;

        The Exalted causes her anima to encompass her gear as
        well as her person, and she adapts perfectly to wearing her
        armor, even in conditions of brutal heat or freezing cold. This
        Charm reduces the fatigue value and mobility penalty of the
        character's armor by one each. A fatigue value of zero means
        that the character need never roll to see if he becomes fatigued
        from wearing the armor. This Charm cannot reduce a
        character's mobility penalty or fatigue value below zero.

        Many Exalted learn to tap the wellsprings of Essence
        that are pain and rage. A character who knows this Charm
        may activate it whenever he is hit in combat. For every point
        of damage he takes before soak is applied, his player may roll
        one die. Each success on this roll causes the character to gain
        a mote of Essence. A character cannot gain more Essence
        from any given attack than his Stamina score.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, the character does not simply tap her
        inner rage and pain to refill her Essence pool, but internalizes it
        to gain true inner strength. The Exalted's player may roll one die
        for each health level of damage the character takes when hit in
        combat (that is, damage successes rolled after the character's soak
        is applied). Each success on this roll causes the Exalted to regain
        a point of temporary Willpower. A character using this Charm
        may not raise her temporary Willpower over its permanent value.

        Battle Fury Focus&lt;br&gt;

        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Willpower-Enhancing Spirit&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Through the use of this Charm, the character taps his
        inner rage, not to replenish his stores of Essence, but in
        conjunction with them. He channels his anger and infuses it
        with primal magic, making him capable of superhuman feats.&lt;br&gt;
        For the duration of the scene, the character has + 1 die to
        all pools related to combat and subtracts -1 from all wound
        penalties. However, the character must either be engaged in
        combat or attempting to become so engaged. He can attack
        at range and differentiate friend from foe, but his player must
        make a Willpower roll for him to utter sentences of more than
        a few words, move away from the enemy or perform a complex
        action, such as retrieving a small object from a pack. Failure
        means the character simply chooses to ignore whatever the
        action is in favor of attacking or readying himself to attack.
        Success means the character can do whatever it was he
        wished, but the Battle Fury Focus immediately ends, with the
        dice pool bonus dissipating and wound penalties returning.
        The bonus vanishes, and the penalties return starting with
        the action that broke the Battle Fury Focus.

        Prerequisite Charms: Battle Fury Focus&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The battle-trance engendered by Bloodthirsty Sword-Dancer
        Spirit is similar to that of Battle Fury Focus, but greater
        in all ways. While in effect, the character is at +3 to all dice
        pools and suffers no wound penalties. However, her awareness
        of the world around her narrows to little more than a
        narrow red tunnel with things that must die at the far end. The
        character cannot use ranged weapons, cannot speak coherently,
        cannot retreat and cannot choose to fight another foe
        until the one she is attacking is definitively dead. She may
        only attack or move toward the nearest foe via the most direct
        route. A character under the effect of Bloodthirsty Sword-Dancer
        Spirit may opt to die where she stands (for example,
        when holding a gate or bridge against tremendous odds) and,
        in this case, need not move toward the next enemy.&lt;br&gt;
        The character may have difficulty telling friend from
        foe if they are dressed similarly but will generally not attack
        close friends, relatives or lovers unless they attempt to get
        between her and her target or otherwise restrain her.&lt;br&gt;
        Bloodthirsty Sword-Dancer Spirit lasts until the character
        can no longer locate an enemy to kill.&lt;br&gt;
        If the character wishes to leave the state earlier, her
        player may make a Willpower roll to snap the character out
        of it. The Willpower roll is normally difficulty 3, but it is made
        at normal difficulty if there is a loved one or friend attempting
        to restrain the character. Unfortunately, in the event that the
        roll fails when a loved one is attempting to calm the character
        down, she is almost certain to lash out at the unrecognizable
        blur obstructing her from slaying her target.

            The constitutions of Exalted are far more resilient
            than those of mere mortals, yet even the Chosen must
            eat. Through the use of this Charm, an Exalted may
            eliminate her need to eat for a single day. Activation of
            this Charm takes the normal investment of Essence and
            meditation for one-quarter hour. Use of this Charm
            does not alleviate the need to drink water. The Charm
            may be used for up to 40 days in a row without penalty.
            Afterward, the Chosen must eat and drink normally for
            three days in a row. This Charm will not work again
            until the Chosen has so eaten.

            investment of Essence and meditation for a full hour. The
            Exalt must eat and drink normally for at least one day
            before this Charm can be used again.

            The Exalted uses Essence to reduce his need for

            not breath until the scene is over, as long as he does nor
            speak and only attempts simple actions. Each turn the
            Exalted attempts a complicated action, including combat,
            he must make a reflexive Stamina + Endurance roll to
            avoid breathing. Obviously, this Charm is of great use in
            poisoned environments.

            the illusion of death. Her heartbeat slows to
            imperceptibility, and she does not breath. To every mortal
            inspection, the Chosen is dead. The Exalted can remain in
            this state for as long as she chooses, but the Charm does not
            remove the need to eat or drink, putting a practical limit
            on its use without the invocation of additional Charms.

            Even the most careful of Exalted must sleep sometime,
            and it is when they sleep that they are most vulnerable.
            The use of this Charm replaces the need for a night's sleep
            with spent Essence, allowing the Exalt to act without
            penalty both day and night. There is no limitation on the
            number of concurrent days on which the Charm may be
            used. However, each night that Unsleeping Watchman
            Technique is invoked is a night without dreaming. After
            a number of consecutive days equal to the Chosen's
            Stamina + Endurance, the Exalted will begin to experience
            waking dreams, seeing and hearing weird, seemingly
            disconnected objects and sounds. Mechanically, the distraction
            of these hallucinations will cause the character to
            suffer a one die penalty on all checks. This penalty increases
            by one day for each additional period of (Stamina
            + Endurance) consecutive days.

            An Exalted with Tireless Runner's Stride can run for
            an extended period to complete her tasks. The Chosen
            must have a specific target in mind when invoking the
            Charm and must invest the Essence as normal. Afterward,
            the Exalted can run without ceasing until her goal is
            reached. She needs no sleep, nor does she need to perform
            bodily functions. If a sufficient supply of food and water is
            carried, the Exalted may eat and drink without stopping or
            slowing her running speed. Her pace is tripled by the
            investiture of Essence and by the lack of need to stop. If the
            Exalted stops running, the Charm ends. This running
            prevents the Exalt from regaining Essence naturally, just
            like any other strenuous exercise. The Exalted must clearly
            know the location she seeks to properly invoke this Charm.

            The Exalted who masters this Charm has his natural life
            extended many times, staving off the reaper with his righteousness.
            While the typical Solar Exalted lives for 2,000 to
            3,000 years, this Charm extends his life to 5,000 to 7,000
            years. The possessor of this Charm shows no sign of aging or
            degradation of health until his very last days walking Creation.
            This Charm offers no protection from damage or
            disease, it merely extends the lifespan of the Chosen. In
            addition to the prerequisites listed above, the Exalted must
            have a rating of at least three in all of his Virtues.

            The character using this Charm infuses his body
            with Essence, allowing him to travel for an entire day
            without becoming fatigued or needing rest, provided
            that he maintains a reasonably steady pace (the char-
            acter cannot run, that requires the Tireless Runner's
            Stride Charm from Caste Book: Zenith, p. 72). A
            character using this Charm could walk or ride at a
            steady pace for an entire day without becoming fatigued,
            footsore or saddlesore. The character must still
            eat and drink and is subject to the effects of the
            environment (like extreme heat or cold), and the
            Charm does not prevent an Exalt's mount from tiring.
            Still, characters using this Charm can cover consider-
            able distance in a fairly short time and arrive at their
            destination as fresh as when they left.&lt;br&gt;
            (This Charm can be used as an alternate prerequisite
            to the Tireless Runner's Stride Charm from
            Caste Book: Zenith.)

        This Charm allows a character to command the respect
        of an audience. While they may not be swayed by his
        arguments or impressed by his performance, they will pay him
        heed and refrain from heckling him or leaving the venue in
        significant numbers prior to the end of the performance.

        Violent mobs can endanger even the Exalted. Their numbers
        can drag down even the mightiest of the Chosen, but those who
        compose the mob are probably not normally so violent or dangerous.
        Chances are, the riot has begun over some legitimate grievance
        — laying about with lethal force is likely to cause serious repercussions.
        Through the use of this Charm, a character can deliver astern
        rebuke and shatter the inertia holding an angry mob together.
        Without significant further impetus, the crowd will disperse. This
        Charm does nothing to an organized or disciplined force.

        If an angry mob is a danger to its victims, then a stampeding
        crowd or a routing unit is a danger to everyone in the
        vicinity. The crush of a panicked crowd will clog a door and
        leave no room for escape, where an orderly exit would have
        saved most or even all of the persons involved. A routing unit
        will shatter, leaving its members vulnerable to attacks that
        could never have been pressed home against the formation.&lt;br&gt;
        When using this Charm, the character burns with an
        incandescent blaze of Essence, radiating power and reassurance.
        All those within a radius of (10 x the Exalted's Essence
        rating) yards are immediately steadied. Those who have failed
        Valor checks can roll again, and characters who must make
        new Valor checks are assumed to succeed. Rout-Stemming
        Gesture can even overcome supernatural panic, such as that
        caused by the Terrifying Apparition of Glory Charm or by the
        anima power of a Dawn Caste Solar Exalted.

        The persuasive power of an Exalted channeling Essence
        into Social Charms can raise mobs as well as disperse them.
        With 10 to 20 minutes of haranguing a crowd on nearly any
        subject, an Exalted can whip the listeners into an angry mob.
        A mob raised in this fashion lasts a number of hours equal to
        the character's Essence rating but (like a natural mob) will
        disperse if subjected to organized opposition that cannot be
        immediately overwhelmed or if the mob is left idle without
        things to smash or burn for more than 10 or 20 minutes.

        The Solar Exalted can inspire far more than simple
        mob violence. An Exalted in battle can radiate the
        confidence and the surety of the Unconquered Sun,
        lifting the souls of those around her and inspiring them
        to feats of great heroism. All friendly troops within a
        radius equal to the character's Essence x 100 yards are
        affected. While subject to this Charm, assume that
        individual soldiers all operate with a bonus die to all
        combat-related dice pools from improved morale and do
        not fail Valor rolls. The effect on the overall outcome of
        the battle is up to the Storyteller to decide, but it should
        have considerable influence.

        Actual combat is only the end of a long process that
        begins with the recruitment and training of the soldiers.
        Exalted who know the Tiger- Warrior Training Technique
        Charm can take even the worst gutter-sweepings or bandits
        and train them into a deadly, disciplined fighting
        force. Characters may supervise the training of up to (their
        Essence rating x 100) soldiers in a given week. Soldiers
        trained for one or more months by Exalted using this
        Charm should be treated as elite troops — they are well-disciplined,
        have ratings of at least 3 in the relevant
        combat Abilities, at least one specialty, Valor ratings of at
        least 3 and at least one Physical Attribute at 3. Already-trained
        troops or troops trained for more than one month
        can excel even these ratings.

        The character channels Essence through his voice or
        his instrument, enhancing his delivery and making the
        final result flow far more effectively than it would natu-
        rally. To use this Charm, the player first makes a regular
        Charisma + Performance roll for the character. Then, the
        player may &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; additional successes, up to (the character's
        permanent Essence rating + the number of successes rolled
        on the Charisma + Performance roll). Each success bought
        in this fashion costs 2 motes of Essence.

        A character who possesses this Charm can give a
        performance so compelling that it plays out in the form
        of phantom images that swirl through the air around
        her. If it is a narrative performance, then the images
        illustrate the narrative, while if it is an abstract performance,
        then the images simply underscore and highlight
        the performance. Typically, this adds a number of dice
        equal to the character's Essence rating to the player's
        next Charisma + Performance roll. Note that the images
        actually appear, fading in and out of existence
        around the character. This Charm is compatible with
        Masterful Performance Exercise.

        The character can channel Essence through her performance
        to evoke a certain emotion in those who witness it.
        The player chooses the emotion to be evoked, which may be
        anger, fear, pride, happiness, jealousy or whatever else the
        player wishes. He then makes a Manipulation + Performance
        roll for the character. Targets with a Willpower
        lower than the number of successes the player achieves on
        this roll are overcome with the emotion in question and act
        accordingly. Those with Willpower below twice the number
        of successes rolled may make a Willpower roll to resist
        the emotion. Those whose Willpower is greater than twice
        the number of successes are unaffected.

        This Charm allows a character to weave a narrative
        so plausible and so compelling that those who hear it
        forget the truth of a matter and come to believe the
        narrative. The player makes a Manipulation + Performance
        roll. The number of successes determines how
        much evidence to the contrary the target must be con-
        fronted with before he is able to shake off the lingering
        effects of the Charm. For each success, the target must be
        presented with one piece of evidence that contradicts the
        narrative. A Solar Exalted in a situation where there is
        very little clear evidence can effectively rewrite history
        with a little careful planning.&lt;br&gt;
        Note that this Charm need not be used as part of a
        performance, per se. Characters who know it can use also
        it during conversation, making them quite dangerous in
        the world of courtly intrigue.

            All friendly troops within a radius equal to the caster's Essence
            x 100 yards will hear the message. The message must be

            she gives the order, she receives impressions of how the battle
            is going on every front. The character is aware of any
            weakness in her lines and of which troops (if any) can safely
            be moved elsewhere. This knowledge combined with the
            ability to give a short command (two dozen words or less) to
            either the entire army or to any section of it — for example,
            &amp;quot;the cavalry&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the troops on the left flank&amp;quot; — enables the
            character to exercise amazing control over her soldiers.

            are going and is instantly aware of any weakness in his lines
            or of any troops who have crushed their opponents. The
            character can, at will, speak messages that will be heard by his
            entire army, or by any specific portion of it to which he wishes
            to give orders. This ability to continuously direct the battle
            gives all soldiers under the character's command one additional
            die for all combat-related rolls and reduces by 1 the
            difficulty of all Valor rolls made by those same troops.

            that a man cannot, and vice-versa, This Charm helps
            an Exalted overcome such problems through disguise.
            By applying Essence to the task, the Chosen can
            enhance his illusion of femininity (or her illusion of
            masculinity). The application of Essence reshapes the
            Exalt's body into the proper curves and leaves those
            who might see his or her sex organs with the impres-
            sion that they were those of the opposite gender. The
            Charm will not fool close physical examination and
            does not allow intercourse, but anyone doing a less
            thorough inspection will be deceived.

            Charisma + Performance roll for the character. Then,
            the player may &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; additional successes, up to (the
            character's permanent Essence rating + the number of
            successes rolled on his Charisma + Performance roll).
            Each success bought in this fashion costs 2 motes of
            Essence. Graceful Reed Dancing is not compatible with
            Masterful Performance Exercise, as it is basically the
            same Charm for a different mode of Performance.

            &lt;br&gt;
            This Charm raises the art of seduction through
            dance to a supernatural level. So long as an Exalt using
            this Charm continues to dance, all who watch the
            performance see him or her as the most desirable being
            possible, regardless of their sexual preference. They are
            unwilling to harm the Chosen and are likely to behave
            irrationally in an attempt to impress the Solar. This
            Charm is ineffective on beings with an Essence higher
            than the Exalted invoking the power. The Charm does
            not work on characters who are in combat or who
            otherwise have reason to believe the Exalt means them
            harm. Overtly hostile acts on the part of the dancing
            character dispel the Charm's effect.

            &lt;br&gt;
            By combining song and dance with the art of seduction,
            the Exalted invoking this Charm weaves a spell of
            influence over a chosen target. Like Husband-Seducing
            Demon's Dance, this Charm starts with a masterful
            performance by the Exalted. This performance includes
            both song and dance and is directed at a specific individual.
            Regardless of the specific genders of the Exalted
            and the target, the target will be entranced by the
            extreme desirability of the performer.&lt;br&gt;
            Other observers of the Divine Performance will be
            affected much as if observing the Husband-Seducing
            Demon's Dance, but the Charm will have no overt effect
            on them. Against the chosen target, however, there is an
            extended effect. The Exalt's player rolls Charisma +
            Performance and compares the resulting number of successes
            against the target's permanent Willpower. Other
            Charms may be used to enhance this Performance roll,
            including the Masterful Performance Exercise.&lt;br&gt;
            If the Chosen achieves more successes than the
            target's permanent Willpower, the target will be particularly
            vulnerable to the influence of the performer for a
            number of days. The duration of this influence is equal to
            the difference between the Exalt's permanent Essence
            and the target's. While under the influence of the Divine
            Performance, a victim is at a -1 Essence with regard to the
            use of mind-controlling or affecting Charms by the
            Exalt. For example, if the Exalted achieves 10 successes
            against a target with a Willpower of 7, the target will be
            at a -1 Essence penalty for 3 days.&lt;br&gt;
            Beings with Essence 1 who have their Essence reduced
            become the infatuated thralls of the Exalt for the
            duration of the effect. They will not kill themselves
            (though they may easily be manipulated into doing so),
            but they will perform almost any other act, even the most
            foolish or foolhardy.&lt;br&gt;
            The Essence penalty does not stack with other uses
            of Divine Performance Style, but the Exalt can use
            Divine Performance again before a previous application
            has expired to extend its duration. In this case, the new
            result replaces the older one, even if it is lower. With
            proper planning, an Exalted performer can keep one or
            more targets entranced indefinitely.

            Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted weaves
            a complicated false identity around herself. The identity
            is complete with a detailed history and natural personal-
            ity traits. Mere conversation cannot detect any flaws in
            the identity. In fact, the infallibility of the identity is
            perfect until the Exalted chooses to drop the façade or she
            is faced with an investigative intellect that is likewise
            Charm-enhanced. King of Masks Technique provides no
            resistance to interrogation techniques.&lt;br&gt;
            When invoking the Charm, the Exalted crafts a
            back-story for herself and her player makes a Intelligence
            + Performance roll, adding one automatic success for
            each mote of Essence she chooses to invest. The total
            number of successes is the number of successes an investigator
            must achieve to see through the false identity, but
            this can never exceed twice the character's Intelligence
            + Performance pool. Only Charm-enhanced Investigation
            rolls will reduce this pool of successes, but all such
            investigations are cumulative. The Fair Folk and beings
            with Essence higher than the character are immune to
            the effects of this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
            At the time of an identity's creation, the Exalted
            may spend one experience point to make the identity
            permanent. The character may resume a permanent
            identity at any time by spending half as many motes of
            Essence as she originally spent creating the identity.
            Persistent investigators can wear away at and eventually
            destroy permanent identities. If an identity is pierced,
            then the experience point is lost. Permanent identities
            can be investigated even when the character is not
            using them. Motes of Essence spent creating a permanent
            identity are not committed after the identity is
            first &amp;quot;put aside,&amp;quot; but whenever the character resumes
            the identity, the Essence she pays to resume it is committed
            while she uses the identity.&lt;br&gt;
            This Charm cannot be used to mimic specific individuals.
            It can only create fictional identities. An Exalted
            may have as many permanent identities as she has points
            of permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;

            Prerequisite Charms: King of Masks Technique&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            Impenetrable Identity is initially identical to King
            of Masks Technique, but with some significant enhancements.
            First of all, while using Impenetrable
            Identity, the Exalted becomes the role he has chosen.
            While the Charm is in effect, he consciously and even
            subconsciously believes he is the role he has adopted.
            Interrogation techniques that do not have a magical
            basis are useless for discovering the Chosen's true
            identity because the character has no idea that he is
            not his cover identity.&lt;br&gt;
            When invoking the Charm, the Exalted crafts a
            back-story for himself and makes a Intelligence + Performance
            roll, adding two automatic successes for each mote
            of Essence, beyond the base cost of 10, she chooses to
            invest. As with King of Masks Technique, the number of
            successes can never exceed twice the character's Intelligence
            + Performance pool. Normal investigation and
            interrogation is useless against Impenetrable Identity,
            and when Charm-enhanced interrogation or investigation
            is used to attack an Impenetrable Identity, only half
            the investigator's successes, rounded down, count for
            reducing the success pool.&lt;br&gt;
            At the time the Charm is invoked, the Chosen may
            set any number of conditions that will automatically
            restore her original identity. This can include a time
            period, arrival at a specific location, spoken key words or
            any other triggering event that the character chooses to
            specify prior to assuming the Impenetrable Identity.
            There can be as many triggering conditions as the character
            wishes, and if they are at all complex, they should
            be written down to prevent disputes. The identity also
            ends automatically if anyone can pierce it and prove it to
            be false. When the identity ends, it is gone forever, and
            the experience point is lost.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through this Charm, an Exalted can program a target to
        undertake an action at a future time. The Exalted must touch
        the target, and the player makes an opposed Willpower roll.
        If the Exalted wins the Willpower roll, she may give the target
        an unspoken command. This command can be as specific and
        elaborate as the character wishes, and the target will not be
        aware of having received it. The suggestion will stay in place
        for a number of days equal to the Charisma of the Exalted
        using the Charm, after which the target forgets it.&lt;br&gt;
        The command can take no more time to execute than the
        Exalted's Essence score in turns. The target can forget or remember
        the act after executing it, at the choice of the Exalted when the
        suggestion is implanted. Characters will not attack themselves or
        others unless already strongly predisposed to do so. If the target wins
        the Willpower roll, she is instantly aware of what the Exalted has
        attempted to do and what the suggestion and conditions were.

        seem terrible and powerful, then Terrifying Apparition of
        Glory makes him unspeakably so. While Terrifying Apparition
        of Glory is in effect, a successful Valor roll is required to attack
        the character. Most animals, even trained attack animals, will
        simply flee. Players of characters who are not actively hostile to
        the Exalted using Terrifying Apparition of Glory must make a
        successful Conviction roll not to obey immediately any non-suicidal
        orders the character gives. This compulsion lasts for at
        least a scene after the target leaves the Exalted's presence.
        Those who are able to attack the Exalted do so at a die penalty
        equal to the character's Essence score. This Charm is not
        compatible with the Dawn Caste's anima ability.

            When the character uses this Charm, she impresses a single
            target with the overwhelming power of her commanding
            nature. Targets who fail a Valor roll at difficulty +2 are frozen in
            place, unable to move for the next scene. This paralysis is
            emotional rather than physical, but cannot be broken as long as
            the attacking character continues to gaze intently at the target.
            While keeping this eye contact, the character can be no more
            than five yards from the target. She also cannot move faster than
            a walk or perform any complex or difficult actions. The target
            receives additional Valor rolls whenever anyone harms or
            obviously attempts to harm him. If the character ceases to gaze
            at the target, the paralysis continues for the next three full turns,
            but the target instantly breaks free if anyone harms or obviously
            attempts to harm him. This Charm has no effect on targets

            authority. Unlike Terrifying Apparition of Glory, this Charm
            does not produce an obvious or overwhelming effect. Instead,
            everyone who is inclined to follow orders — including
            peasants, servants, shop assistants, enlisted military person-
            nel and similar individuals— will obey the character as if she
            were in a position of authority over them. Any target that
            makes a successful opposed Willpower roll against the char-
            acter realizes that the character does not have the authority
            to command him. Everyone else will obey all reasonable-
            sounding commands given by the character. Orders to
            commit suicide, go on killing rampages, or requests to give
            the character most or all of the target's money or possessions
            will end the character's influence over the target, However,
            requests for information or admittance to otherwise restricted
            areas will be instantly granted, as will demands for
            moderately expensive merchandise (up to Resources ••) in
            a shop, even if the character does not pay for it.&lt;br&gt;
            Targets may make another opposed Willpower roll to
            disobey the character if a recognized superior contradicts the
            character's orders. Targets who fail this roll will ignore their
            actual superior's requests. One of this Charm's most potent
            and useful features is that others observing the interaction
            will see nothing odd or magical about the character or the
            target'sreaction. This Charm has no effect on beings with an
            Essence greater than 1, though it has proven effective on Fair
            Folk commoners and other supernatural creatures of an
            inherently servile nature.

            An Exalted acting in accordance with virtue is an
            impressive figure indeed — an Exalted using this Charm
            is even more so. By using this Charm, the Chosen puts
            the weight of her passions behind her arguments. She
            may add one of her Virtue ratings in automatic successes
            to a single Presence roll. The Virtue may be chosen
            when the Charm is invoked, but the Exalted must be
            acting in accordance with the virtue in question. If the
            Exalted is not, or does not, act according to the Virtue,
            the Essence is spent, but no bonus is gained. Invoking
            this Charm automatically adds one point to the
            character's Limit.

            one of the Chosen may spend Essence to let the
            strength of her virtue strike fear in the hearts of those
            who would oppose her. For the remainder of the Scene,
            any character with a Willpower lower than the Exalted's
            current Limit suffers a penalty to his dice pools equal
            to the Exalt's Essence when attempting to attack her.
            Invoking this Charm automatically adds one point to

        The Exalted uses Essence to enhance his ability to withstand
        attack. The player may roll up to his character's Stamina
        + Resistance in dice, but must spend one mote of Essence per
        die rolled. For every success on this roll, the character adds 1 to
        his bashing soak for the remainder of the scene. This Charm
        may be used again on subsequent rounds, but a character
        cannot gain more dice of bashing soak via Durability of Oak
        Meditation than his Stamina + Resistance.&lt;br&gt;

        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted hardens
        his skin into impenetrability, sacrificing some of his life
        force to gain the strength of unbreakable diamond. The
        character using this Charm takes no damage whatsoever
        from a single attack. This Charm does not protect the
        character from the secondary effects of the attack - for
        example, a character smashed down through a sheet of ice
        and into a frozen lake by the blow of a giant beastman's
        club would take no damage from the impact or from
        passing through the ice, but she would have to contend
        with the dangers of drowning and hypothermia.&lt;br&gt;
        The Adamant Skin Technique can also be used to
        withstand physical damage not associated with combat. It is as
        effective at withstanding the impact of a fall as the blow of a
        sword. However, Storytellers should keep in mind that the
        defense offered by the Adamant Skin Technique is of a very
        short duration — the character might use it to withstand the
        impact of a falling idol or a plunge from the top of a tower, but
        a character who hurled himself into a blazing firepit would only
        be protected for a second or two. A character must invoke the
        Adamant Skin Technique before his opponent's attack roll.

        hours and established her possession of it.

        The player may add a number of automatic successes
        equal to the character's Stamina to her Stamina + Resistance
        roll to resist the effects of poison. Though even the
        hardiest Exalted can still be slain by massive doses of
        poison while using this Charm, they are largely invulnerable
        to poisoned food and envenomed blades. Characters
        need not invoke this Charm before exposure to poison —
        they may call upon its effects after they are exposed but
        before the Stamina + Resistance roll is made to survive
        the toxin. &lt;br&gt;
        Use of this Charm allows a character to withstand

        While the Exalted are little-affected by disease, they
        can still become sick. Fevers can slow them at critical
        moments. Further, while the Chosen can withstand even
        the most serious illnesses with little more than a feeling of
        weariness and discomfort, those illnesses are as lethal as
        ever to mortals who contract them from exposure to the
        infected Exalted.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the player to add a number of
        automatic successes equal to her character's Stamina to the
        Stamina + Resistance roll to avoid contracting an illness.
        Further, the player may add a like number of automatic
        successes to her character's daily Stamina + Endurance roll
        to overcome an illness she has already contracted.

            Some Exalted, in their years of wandering the wilder-
            ness, develop an immunity to nature's rigors. To simulate
            this, a character can take this Charm to grant permanent
            resistance to one of the following conditions. Each time she
            purchases this Charm, she can choose one of the following:&lt;br&gt;
            • Resistance to Extreme Heat&lt;br&gt;
            • Resistance to Extreme Cold&lt;br&gt;
            • Resistance to Acid&lt;br&gt;
            • Resistance to Windblown Particles&lt;br&gt;
            A character with one of these resistances suffers no
            damage from natural occurrences of the condition and is
            comfortable acting in it wearing normal gear. For instance,
            a Chosen with Resistance to Extreme Heat may walk
            across the most brutal of deserts without penalty, but still
            suffers damage if caught in a forest fire or magical flame.
            This Charm is similar to Ox-Body Technique, in that an
            Exalt can take it repeatedly, until she has purchased all
            four versions. A character cannot purchase this Charm
            more times than she has dots in the Resistance Ability.

            By invoking this Charm, the Exalted becomes
            immune to the negative effects of alcohol for the rest
            of the scene. He suffers no penalties during or after the
            scene in which Alcohol-Resisting Prana is used, and in
            fact, the effect is quite pleasant, as the character
            experiences the euphoric feelings of drunkenness without
            any of the impairment normally associated with
            heavy drinking. If the character is already drunk, then
            all negative effects of the alcohol are negated until the
            Charm ends. In addition, invoking this Charm prevents
            any chance of hangover from alcohol drunk
            during the scene, whether or not the Charm was in
            effect when the alcohol was consumed.

            The Drunken Warrior Technique allows the invoking
            Exalted to harness the unpredictability of
            drunkenness in combat. When this Charm is invoked,
            the character may add dice to an attempt to attack or an
            attempt to dodge or to parry an attack. The Charm may
            be invoked multiple times per turn, but the total num-
            ber of dice added in a given turn cannot exceed the
            number of drinks the character has had during the scene
            or the sum of the character's Resistance and Perfor-
            mance Abilities, whichever is lower.
            For the purposes of this Charm, a &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot; is a glass of
            wine, a tankard of beer, a dram of hard liquor or the
            equivalent. This Charm does not provide any immunity
            to the negative effects of drinking, but may be used even
            if the alcohol's effects have been negated though the use
            of the Alcohol-Resisting Prana.

            &lt;br&gt;
            The Inebriated Fool Defense allows the Exalted to
            utilize the effects alcohol has on the human body,
            loosening its muscles and joints, to withstand damage.
            When this Charm is invoked, the character may add a
            number of points to his bashing soak equal the number
            of drinks he has consumed during the scene. This
            number can be no greater than the sum of the Exalted's
            Resistance and Performance Abilities. The Charm may
            be invoked multiple times per turn, and the bonus is the
            same each time it is invoked. The effects of this Charm
            are compatible with other Resistance Charms that in-
            crease the character's bashing soak.
            For the purposes of this Charm, a &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot; is a glass of
            wine, a tankard of beer, a dram of hard liquor or the

            The character's will and body are strengthened by
            Essence, allowing her to easily endure all forms of
            torture and interrogation. The player may add a num-
            ber of automatic successes equal to the character's
            permanent Essence to any Resistance rolls to avoid
            breaking under interrogation. The character need not
            call upon this power before the interrogation and may
            even invoke it after giving some information during
            the interrogation.&lt;br&gt;
            Use of this Charm does not negate the effects of any
            toxins used in the interrogation, nor does it prevent
            damage. It merely allows the character complete control
            over what she chooses to say.

            The cumulative effects of pain can bring down even
            the hardiest of Exalted. This Charm allows a Chosen to
            ignore pain through the application of Essence. To activate
            the Charm, the Exalted chooses to what degree he
            wishes to ignore wound penalties for the remainder of the
            scene. For each -1 wound penalty the character ignores,
            the Charm costs 1 mote to activate. This Charm may be
            used multiple times during a single scene, with cumulative
            effects. A character can also negate more points of
            wound penalties than he is currently suffering, to anesthetize
            himself against later injury.

            Through the expenditure of Essence, this Charm
            allows the Exalted to reinforce his ability to withstand
            attack with one of his Virtues. The character must
            choose the Virtue at the beginning of the scene and act
            in accordance with that Virtue for the duration of the
            scene. If at any point he acts contrary to the chosen
            Virtue, the Armor of Virtue fades immediately, Specifically,
            attempting any action that would require failing a
            Virtue check causes the Charm's effects to expire. For
            example, abandoning or attempting to abandon a loved
            one to perish miserably while under the protection of
            Compassion causes the Armor of Virtue to fail.&lt;br&gt;
            When invoked, the Armor of Virtue Technique
            increases the character's bashing soak by the value of the
            character's chosen Virtue for the rest of the scene. This
            Charm may be used again on subsequent turns, but a
            character cannot gain a greater bonus to his bashing soak
            via Armor of Virtue Technique than his Stamina +
            Resistance. The effects of this Charm are compatible
            with the effects of other Resistance Charms that increase
            the character's soak.
            While under the effect of the Armor of Virtue Technique,
            the Exalted's Caste Mark glows brightly, as if the
            character had spent 4 to 7 motes of Peripheral Essence.
            Invoking this Charm automatically adds one point to the

            Armor of Virtue Technique allows the Exalted to reinforce
            his ability to withstand attack with one of his Virtues.
            The character must choose the Virtue at the beginning of
            the scene and act in accordance with it for the duration of
            the scene. If at any point he acts contrary to the chosen
            virtue, the Fivefold Armor of Virtue fades immediately, as
            per the Armor of Virtue Technique.&lt;br&gt;
            When invoked, the Fivefold Armor of Virtue
            Technique increases the character's lethal soak roll by
            the value of the character's chosen Virtue for the rest
            of the scene. This Charm may be used again on subsequent
            turns, but a character cannot gain a greater
            bonus to his lethal soak via Fivefold Armor of Virtue
            than his Stamina + Resistance.&lt;br&gt;
            While under the effect of the Fivefold Armor of
            Virtue Technique, the Exalted's anima glows brightly
            enough to read by, as if the character had spent 8 to 10
            motes of Peripheral Essence. Characters wearing armor
            cannot use this Charm. Invoking this Charm automatically
            adds one point to the character's Limit.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character can deal
        well with nearly any wild animal. The character must be
        within one yard of the target per point of her Essence.
        Herbivores and smaller omnivores will become somewhat
        docile, even letting the character pet or handle them.
        Predators are less susceptible to this power, and most will
        simply let the character pass unmolested through their
        territory. This power does not work on sentient animals,
        animals that are trained to attack or animals that are
        insane from pain, hunger or disease.

        By handling an animal, feeding it, petting and scratching
        it and otherwise interacting with it, a character who
        knows this Charm can forge a permanent magical bond
        with the beast. Each time the character uses this Charm
        on the target, it is as if he gained a point of the Familiar
        Background with the target animal as the Familiar. So a
        character who wished to tame a tiger would have to use
        it at least three times to cause the beast to become well-disposed
        to him and an additional two times to gain the
        ability to see through the beast's eyes and communicate
        with it. Obviously, using this Charm on animals such as
        bears, tigers and tyrant lizards can be problematic, as they
        will not allow themselves to be handled, even under the
        effects of Friendship with Animals Approach. A strong
        wrestling ability or a willingness to raise the animal from
        a cub is useful in such instances. Characters cannot have
        more than one Spirit-Tied Pet at a time.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character becomes
        able to survive in even the most hostile conditions without
        special preparations. Blazing heat or terrible cold are no danger
        to the character, nor are hypothermia from rain or water
        exposure, trench foot, snow and sand blindness, leeches, mosquitoes
        and other potentially deadly biting insects — the
        character is perfectly at home in a harsh wilderness environment.
        This magic protects the character even if he personally
        is not prepared for the environment. A character using Hardship-Surviving
        Mendicant Spirit is at home on a glacier if he is
        bundled in the warmest clothing available or if he is clad in
        nothing but silk slippers and a pair of pantaloons (though he
        may have difficulty walking over ice in silk slippers).&lt;br&gt;
        Note that this Charm does not protect against the most
        hostile of environments - ocean survival, underwater
        survival or the extreme elemental effects near the elemental
        poles. To exist in those environments, characters must use
        the Element-Resisting Prana Charm (p. 182).

        With this Charm, the character can find his way safely and
        surely through even the worst terrain. The character (and a
        number of persons following him equal to twice his Essence
        score) can travel through even the worst terrain with ease.
        Travel through most terrain (forest, light marsh, rock and sand
        desert) is about as fast as if the character was walking over flat,
        level ground - characters will travel about 20 miles a day.
        Travel over very harsh terrain (muskeg at high summer, glacier,
        bayou, dense scrub or fresh-growth jungle) is at half this speed.

        A character with this Charm will never go hungry. In
        a hour of foraging for food, she can gather enough nuts,
        berries, edible tubers, slugs, bugs and small animals to make
        a large meal for a number of people equal to her Essence
        score. Note that this skill typically does not involve
        hunting game, and so, the character does not need a
        hunting tool such as a spear, sling or bow — the character
        will probably not bring back anything larger than a rabbit.
        Storytellers may wish to make it more difficult to gather
        food in certain environments (deep sandy desert and pack
        ice, for example) but should not impose a penalty greater
        than halving the Exalted's take. This is, after all, magic.

        The character can track anyone in the wilderness,
        following the most minute signs and, sometimes, nothing
        more than a magical intuition of where the target has gone.
        The character can track anyone through any terrain, so long
        as the trail is fresh enough. Over difficult terrain for tracking
        (open ocean, rocky desert, grasslands), the trail remains
        fresh for typically one day per point of the tracking character's
        permanent Essence. Over terrain more amenable to tracking,
        it can be two or even three times that long.&lt;br&gt;
        This ability can be foiled by the Traceless Passage Charm.
        If the target is using Traceless Passage, then the tracker and
        target resolve the matter as if neither was using magic. See
        &amp;quot;Tracking&amp;quot; on page 245 of the Drama chapter for details.

        Trough the use of this Charm, the character can conceal
        himself or an object no bigger around than his Essence rating
        in yards so well as to be undetectable. In order to gain the
        benefit of this Charm, the character must spend one hour
        camouflaging his position or the object to be concealed. So
        long as the character stays still and takes no violent action, he
        will not be seen. Note that a character or object camouflaged
        in this fashion is essentially fixed in position. If the character
        moves suddenly or at great length, the effect is disturbed and
        the Charm ceases to have its effect.&lt;br&gt;
        Camouflaged objects or characters can be found
        after a number of hours of intensive searching in their
        immediate area equal to the camouflaging character's
        Essence score or by a character with Unsurpassed (Sense)
        Discipline or some similarly powerful perception power
        whose player succeeds in a Perception + Awareness roll
        against the character's Intelligence + Survival. Note that
        camouflage covers scent and other detection methods as
        well as visual stealth.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character can
        make his passage and the passage of additional persons
        equal to his Essence score totally traceless. They cannot be
        tracked by conventional means, not even with the aid of
        tracking animals or other tracking aids. Only characters
        with the Unshakeable Bloodhound Technique Charm
        can follow them, and even then, it's played out as if they
        were tracking him without magical assistance.

        able to survive in any environment. The character
        can survive in extreme environments, such as the extreme
        heat and toxic fumes within the caldera of active volcanoes,
        can exist underwater with no ill effects and can even
        exist without danger in conditions as harsh as those of the
        elemental poles. While this Charm is active, the character
        adds her Endurance to her soak when she takes damage
        from elemental sources such as cold, fire and lightning.

            This Charm protects the invoker from the adverse
            affects of natural weather. The Exalted may move through
            heavy winds without being impeded by them, travel
            through a sand- or snowstorm without being blinded or
            spend a stormy night with no shelter without fear of
            becoming waterlogged. The Chosen's anima deflects
            these conditions, providing a nearly skintight zone of
            protection for the Exalted and any possessions worn
            against her body. This Charm does not protect against
            damage from temperature extremes.

            high winds or driving rain, but it will not spread unless

            per success on the character's Willpower roll. This
            power can strike at a range of line of sight. Against
            demons, ghosts or other creatures of the night, the
            damage is aggravated. This attack cannot normally be

            allow them to do either in their defense.

            When invoking this Charm, the Exalted names a
            single breed of animal, which may include &amp;quot;human.&amp;quot; He
            then crafts a snare appropriate for trapping the species of
            interest. For each mote invested in the Charm, the
            Survival roll to create the snare is increased by one die.
            In addition, for each mote invested, the targeted breed
            suffers a one-die penalty to detect or escape the trap. The
            trap will not be triggered by any species other than the
            one named. This trap cannot be used to snare a specific
            specimen, but instead, affects the first member of the
            species that encounters it.&lt;br&gt;
            Game-Snaring Huntsman's Method cannot be used
            to create a trap that will innately do damage, such as spike-pits
            or deadfalls. It can only be used to enhance snares, pit
            traps and the like. If incidental damage is done to a target
            in escaping the trap, then the trap may still be eligible for
            the Game-Snaring Huntsman's Method.

            &lt;br&gt;
            The Devil-Pit Technique functions in many ways
            like the Game-Snaring Huntsman's Method. The Exalted
            names a breed of animal to be targeted by the trap.
            The roll for creating the trap is increased by one die for
            every 2 motes invested in the Charm, and the targeted
            breed suffers a like number of dice in penalty for rolls to
            detect or escape the trap. The trap will not be triggered
            by any species other than the named one, nor can it be set
            to trap a specific individual.
            Unlike Game-Snaring Huntsman's Method, Devil-Pit
            Technique can be used to enhance traps that are
            designed to cause damage or death to their targets, rather
            than restrain them. A trap enhanced by the Devil-Pit
            Technique does one die of soakable lethal damage per 2
            motes invested in the Charm. This damage is in addition
            to any damage a normal trap of the design might do.

            direction of) of where the Pole of Earth is located. Each
            additional success makes this sense of direction more
            precise; with three or more successes, the Exalt will know
            exactly where the pole is in relation to his current location,
            with sufficient clarity to be able to navigate with the aid of
            a compass and map. Any additional successes beyond three

        The character channels Essence through his hands and
        tools, enhancing his efforts and making the final produce of his
        work far more impressive than the fruits of any mortal craftsman's
        labor. To use this Charm, the player first makes a regular
        Intelligence or Stamina + Craft roll for the character. Then, the
        player may &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; additional successes, up to the character's
        Essence rating + the number of successes rolled on the Craft roll.
        Each success bought in this fashion costs 3 motes of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        Storytellers should consider strongly granting special bonuses
        to objects that are made from good or exceptional
        materials to start and that have astonishing numbers of successes.
        For more details on this, see the &amp;quot;Craft&amp;quot; section of the
        Drama chapter, page 245. Note that Flawless Handiwork
        Method's effects do not occur instantly — the character must
        still take the regular amount of time necessary to construct an
        object of that type, though he need take no longer. An Exalted
        craftsman can knock together in a morning items that would
        take a mortal craftsman months or years to produce.

        This Charm strengthens objects, allowing them to
        endure far more damage than normal. Very fragile objects
        such as those made of paper or glass cannot be damaged
        without the full exertion of a Strength at least equal to the
        Essence rating of the character who used the Object-
        Strengthening Touch Charm on them. Objects that are
        not so fragile take roughly twice as much force as normal
        to harm. For rules on breaking and lifting objects, see the
        &amp;quot;Athletics&amp;quot; section of the Drama chapter, page 251.&lt;br&gt;
        Object-Strengthening Touch does not just protect
        against breakage — strengthened objects are also resistant
        to fire, acid, freezing and other forms of damage. The
        character using Object-Strengthening Touch must touch
        the object in order to cause this Charm to take effect.
        Characters can strengthen any object, not just objects that
        are at the focus of the character's Craft Ability. This
        Charm does not work on animals or sentient beings.

        Objects subjected to this Charm do not have the immense
        durability of objects subjected to Object-Strengthening
        Touch, but the enhancement is permanent. While objects
        treated with Durability-Enhancing Technique are not completely
        immune to the ravages of time and nature, they are
        very resistant, enduring at least 10 times as long as untreated
        objects. Objects treated with Durability-Enhancing Technique
        add twice the Exalted's score in the Crafts Ability to the
        Strength + Athletics dice pool required to break them. Items
        such as swords and axes that have been treated with
        Durability-Enhancing Technique hold their edges longer, even if
        used to hack through doors or otherwise mistreated

        Someone who works with a material for a long time
        learns its strengths and weaknesses. A character who knows
        this Charm can channel Essence to intensify this knowledge
        and can rend stone and metal with his bare hands and tear
        apart wooden doors with his fingers. A character using the
        Shattering Grasp Charm multiplies his Strength + Athletics
        by 2 for the purposes of breaking or damaging the basic
        material he works with for the focus of his Craft skill -
        typically metal, stone or wood. If the character is making an
        attack against such an object, double his damage successes.
        Tanners and leathercrafters do not gain the ability to do extra
        damage in hand-to-hand combat with this Charm.

        The ravages of the Wyld can twist objects, as well as men. For
        every object that is made better suited to its task, 100 are ruined by
        the energies of unbounded change. This Charm makes an object
        far more resistant to the twisting effects of Wyld energy. Chaos
        Resistance Preparation is not as complete as the Lore Charms that:
        stabilize persons, causing an object protected by this Charm to take
        only take 10 times as long to change as it would normally. However,
        the effects of Chaos-Resistance Preparation are permanent. Objects
        treated with this Charm lend no protective qualities to their
        bearers — a suit of Chaos-Resistant armor will not protect the
        character wearing it from Wyld-induced mutation.

        A character using the Crack-Mending Technique can fix
        any broken object, no matter how severely damaged, so long as
        it was not totally unmade (for example, by powerful sorcery,
        digestion in a Behemoth's gullet or immersion in molten rock).
        The character must spend a number of hours working on the
        object equal to 10 - her Essence, slowly piecing it back together
        and coaxing the fragments to bind to one another.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm can even remake extremely damaged things
        such as shattered crystal and burnt paper, but it cannot
        remake metaphorical or conceptual things —it cannot mend
        broken hearts, oaths or promises, for example, nor can it
        remake shattered dreams or smashed hopes. Also, it cannot
        remake an object more yards in radius than the character's
        Essence rating. Crack-Mending Technique can restore damaged
        items of First Age manufacture but can do nothing to
        repair those whose magic has fled or been exhausted.

            A Solar who truly masters some form of representational
            art — most obviously painting, but other possibilities
            include tapestry-weaving, carving and metal-casting -
            can fashion miniature worlds within a lifelike representation.
            A being that knows how to expend Essence can step
            into the image and experience it as if it were real. Although
            the examples within the Invisible Fortress are &amp;quot;life sized,&amp;quot;
            a World Within a Picture's physical matrix could be much
            smaller; for instance, a metal brooch chased and enameled
            with an uncannily realistic miniature scene.&lt;br&gt;
            The World Within a Picture can include planes,
            animals or even people, but none of the people are actually
            real. They react only in simple, stereotyped ways, like
            automata. (A Solar can trap real people or spirits within a
            still life to become permanent characters, but this involves
            a spell of Celestial Circle Sorcery.) A World Within a
            Picture's simulated world cannot exceed one acre in area,
            although it may look much larger: A person who tries to
            travel beyond the boundaries of the still life either goes in
            a circle or steps out of the still life.&lt;br&gt;
            Creating a World Within a Picture takes weeks or
            months, depending on the artist's medium and the level of
            detail the artist desires. Once created, a World Within a
            Picture lasts until someone or something destroys it. Other
            Charms and sorceries can piggyback on a World Within a
            Picture if the artist wants to include magical effects within
            the simulated world, such a still life in which people can
            fly, or one that transforms visitors into other forms.&lt;br&gt;
            Entering a World Within a Picture costs 1 mote of
            Essence. Departing is free. Anyone caught within a completely
            destroyed Still Life dies. A Still Life that is merely damaged can
            be repaired, and prisoners retrieved, but only by someone who
            knows the World Within a Picture Style Charm.

            This Charm enables a Solar to spin raw stone into
            flexible thread or yarn. Rock thread is fireproof but no
            stronger than linen and rather scratchy to wear. It is
            entirely adequate for tapestries, tablecloths, rugs and other
            utilitarian purposes, though, and in large quantities, it
            makes excellent insulation. The thread or yarn remains
            the same color as the original rock, making most spun rock
            rather drab — but a Solar with this Charm can spin jade or
            diamond as easily as slate or sandstone. A handkerchief of
            spun jewels would make an understated yet truly royal gift.
            The basic Charm requires no more than a simple
            drop-spindle or spinning wheel and a quantity of rock. The
            listed Essence cost and duration are for spinning a cubic
            foot of rock into a cubic yard of fluffy fiber. The process
            takes a full hour. A more elaborate apparatus (such as the
            broken machine in the Fortress) reduces the Essence cost
            to 1 mote, and the machine runs by itself once set running.
            Indeed, the apparatus reduces rock-spinning to magic that
            even unExalted mortals can perform.

            Characters utilizing this Charm can mold
            edible food out of any other material, be it rock,
            wood or even snow. The simpler the food and
            the smaller the portion, the less it costs to make.
            Conjuring a loaf of bread requires just 1 mote of
            Essence and about five minutes, while sculpting
            an entire feast can cost 10 motes or more and
            take an entire day. This food can be stored.
            However, it will gradually lose its reality and
            after a week, it will fade to wisps of Essence
            when handled.&lt;br&gt;
            While it will fill the belly, conjured food
            offers little in the way of vitamins or minerals.
            For every week that food created in this manner,
            makes up more than 50 percent of a character's
            diet, he will lose one dot in Willpower. Obviously,
            if a character has mastered a sorcery that
            allows him to conjure real food, these penalties
            do not apply.

            With this Charm, an Exalted can purify base metal or
            other raw substances of natural taints and flaws, working
            badly tanned raw leather into butter-soft suede, cheap
            marble into smooth stone worthy of the palace of the
            Empress and flawed jewels into pure specimens of their
            kind. Characters cannot use this Charm to convert raw
            materials into any of the Five Magical Materials - for
            example, turning gold into orichalcum. That must be done
            by the usual long, slow process of extraction. However, the
            Exalt can greatly improve the quality of raw materials by
            invoking this Charm as he creates an item. The character
            may purify the materials for an object in an equal number
            of Dexterity or Stamina + Crafts successes as required to
            create the item. Players may roll for their characters once
            per scene of work. For the purposes of this Charm, each
            scene is normally a day of work, though it can be less (for
            example, if the Solar is using the Charm Craftsman Needs
            No Tools, a scene is probably about an hour).

            upon a living being, human or animal, just as he
            might instill strength into an object. The Solar places his
            hands upon the subject of this Charm and uses his powers
            to force the subject's living body to conform to principles
            of stability and good construction, enhancing its ability
            to receive blows or other damage. For the remainder of
            the scene, the subject of the Charm takes half damage
            after soak (but before damage is rolled, to a minimum of
            one die) from all blows struck by beings with a Craft
            Ability equal to or less than that of the Exalted who
            invoked the Charm. The character also has some degree
            of protection from forces such as cold, fire, lightning or
            acid and soaks two additional levels of lethal damage
            from such attacks until the end of the scene. A sorcerer

            This Charm enables an Exalted to shake the foundations
            of buildings and pound down walls with his bare fists
            due to his understanding of the nature of craftsmanship
            and the principles of workmanship. When attempting to
            destroy or break any nonliving crafted material of any
            substance, add his Essence + Craft to his Strength +
            Athletics to determine if he can break something or to the
            amount of damage he does in an attack against an object.
            A character can use this Charm against any sort of material,
            regardless of the material she crafts. The only
            requirement is that the subject of his strikes, be it a wall, a
            door, a weapon or a building's foundation, be in some way
            worked or shaped by intelligent beings. This Charm is

            With this Charm, an Exalted can create objects that
            are not only resistant to the effects of the Wyld, but also
            protect those who wear them. Infusing a part of his own life
            into the item — which can be anything from a ring to a full
            suit of armor — the Solar instills a natural aura of order and
            stability into it, causing it to remain safe from changes for
            a full year. As long as the object endures unchanged
            preserved by the Charm, its wearer will also be protected
            from the Wyld's ravages. Remember that the mote in-
            vested remains committed for the duration of the Charm
            or until the magic is canceled by the Exalt.

        links between objects. For the remainder of the scene, add his
        Essence score in automatic successes to any Investigation rolls.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By examining the undisturbed physical evidence of
        an event, the character can reconstruct the physical
        process behind that event. For example, finding a body
        with a knife wound, the character can tell what sort of
        knife was used, from what direction the blow was struck
        and so on. This effect need not be limited to bodies and
        the scenes of crimes — characters can likewise recon-
        struct the evidence left behind by liaisons, examine the
        details of a camp site, etc.&lt;br&gt;
        Obviously, the event must have left significant physical
        evidence for a character to analyze. If the evidence is
        disturbed significantly, the Charm doesn't function automatically.
        The player must instead make a Perception
        + Investigation roll with a difficulty determined by the
        amount of disturbance the evidence has been subjected
        to, with success indicating that the character can reconstruct
        the events.

        This Charm allows the character to tell if a specific
        individual is lying to her. This Charm is infallible, within its
        limits. If the target refuses to answer or answers in an unclear
        fashion, the Charm will not indicate him as having lied.
        Likewise, it can only detect lies the target knows to be lies. If the
        target sincerely believes something to be the case, then the
        Charm will not detect him as having lied. This Charm in no
        way compels or reveals the truth — it only detects falsehoods.&lt;br&gt;

        By sorting through possessions, physical evidence and so
        on left by a particular individual, an Exalted using this Charm
        may construct a psychological profile of the character who left
        the evidence. The clarity of this profile is determined by the
        amount of material the Exalted employing this Charm has to
        sort through. The more material, the more likely the character
        is to derive an accurate picture; the use of the Investigation
        Charm Crafty Observation Method is extremely beneficial as
        an aid to the use of this Charm. If there is material mixed in
        that does not actually belong to the target of analysis, then the
        Exalted's picture of the target will be distorted.

        An Exalted using this Charm can make her questions
        impossible to resist. During the extended interrogation of a
        target whose Willpower is equal to or less than her Essence, she
        may wring him utterly dry — he is unable to lie, dissimulate or
        otherwise prevaricate. If the target has Willpower equal to or
        less than twice the Exalted's Essence, the Exalted's player may
        make a Manipulation + Investigation roll. For every success,
        the target must truthfully and to the best of his ability answer
        a single question. The Charm Ten Magistrate Eyes cannot be
        used to gain extra successes on this roll.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not work on targets whose Willpower is
        higher than twice the Exalted's Essence. In any event, this
        Charm loses its effectiveness with repeated use — if used by an
        Exalted on the same target more than once during a period equal
        to the target's Willpower in weeks, the Charm has no effect.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Errata:&lt;br&gt;
        On the sixth line of the first paragraph of the charm’s description, it says that a weak effect occurs if the
        target’s Willpower is less than or equal to &amp;quot;twice the Exalted’s Willpower&amp;quot;. This should read &amp;quot;twice the
        Exalted’s Essence&amp;quot; instead.

        By visiting the scene of an event and attuning himself to
        local Essence flows and residues, the Exalted can psychically
        reenact history, reconstructing the event to the point of
        gaining insight he could not normally receive from evidence
        alone. The character must have time alone to go over the
        scene, touch and examine the largely undisturbed evidence
        and &amp;quot;get into the shoes&amp;quot; of one of the people involved.&lt;br&gt;
        The Exalted experiences flashbacks of the event from the
        perspective of the person he is emulating and gains insight into
        the target's persona, including her Nature and her superficial
        feelings and attitudes over the course of the reenacted event.
        Characters involved in reenacting an event are rarely danger-
        ous, but if disturbed, they may very briefly cling to the adopted
        persona before snapping back to the current moment.

            When a character uses this Charm, he will perceive
            blood dripping from the hands of anyone within 10 yards of
            him who has killed someone within the last five days. The
            vision is momentary, but quite clear. The Charm lasts long
            enough for him to turn around and look all around him,
            though if someone takes pains to hide her hands, he will not
            be able to see any blood that might be there and judge
            whether or not she has killed. A target who has merely killed
            a single person will have simple bloodstains on her hands; an
            Exalted who has massacred a troop of guards will have hands
            dripping with gore. The Charm makes no distinctions on
            the basis of motives for killing or types of killing, but merely
            shows whether or not those close by have killed.

            This Charm allows the Exalted to scan a crowd of
            people or a landscape, as far as the eye can see, searching
            for a particular person or thing, focusing all his attention
            on his prey. If any part of his target is theoretically within
            his view — however great the distance — then he will see
            it as clearly as if he were only 10 yards away, together with
            the immediate surroundings for five yards around the
            target. This applies even if his target is camouflaged or
            partly concealed, in which case the visible part of the
            target will be identified as obviously part of the complete
            target. The only way to avoid this Charm is to be wholly
            concealed by some object between the target and the
            Exalt. However, the Exalted must know what he is looking
            for; attempts merely to look for &amp;quot;something odd&amp;quot; will be
            fruitless. Characters who are invisible cannot be detected
            with this spell, but even the cleverest of magical camouflage
            is penetrated by it.

            With this Charm, an Exalt can hear the private
            whispers of guilt that underlie most speech, betraying the
            dark secrets of an interrogated person. When invoked, it
            will allow the Solar to know the single thing about which
            the target feels guiltiest concerning the subject under
            discussion. The Solar will seem to hear the target's voice
            whispering his guilt and shame about the matter, while the
            target continues to speak of whatever he chooses and is not
            necessarily aware that he is revealing his hidden secrets. If
            the target refuses to say anything, then the Charm fails to
            provide any answers. Also, the Charm operates on the
            target's personal perceptions of guilt: If the target feels no
            guilt or shame about his private actions, then the Charm
            will not reveal them. Thus, a sincere and self-justified
            revolutionary might betray his shame in not speaking up
            publicly for his cause but not his private involvement in a
            recent assassination of a Terrestrial Exalted. Unfortunately,
            the Charm will not function on someone with an
            Essence equal to or greater than that of the user.

        Exposure to Wyld energies can cause hallucinations,
        psychological dependency, insanity and even terrible mutations.
        Through the use of this Charm, the character makes her
        person proof against the influence of Wyld energies. While
        the Charm is in effect, her mind and body cannot be warped
        or twisted by the power of the Wyld. Note that, while the
        character's shape and sanity are protected, her body can still
        be torn asunder by Wyld-spawned phenomenon; the whirling
        walls of fire and thunder and the 100-headed snake
        monsters with burning chalcedony eyes are quite real.&lt;br&gt;
        Similarly, her possessions are vulnerable, though the
        protective effect of the Charm does seem to spill over to them
        slightly. A character's sword will turn into a snake that hisses
        and slithers off rather than an asp that bites her hand, and her
        armor will suddenly become gossamer spiderwebs rather than
        sheets of rotting gristle full of carnivorous maggots.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character protects
        his possessions from the warping influence of the Wyld.
        While the Charm lasts, the character and his goods (an
        amount which can equal a fully laden horse if the character
        is mounted) can sojourn in even the most fluid areas of the
        Wyld without worry that they will suddenly become something
        other than what they currently are.&lt;br&gt;
        Note again that Wyld-spawned phenomenon are not
        warded against, though the Charm makes certain sorts of
        mishaps (falling into the sky, having the ground suddenly
        open up to become a pit of mechanical alligators) quite
        unlikely. The character may be blasted asunder or eaten
        and digested, but up and down will continue to mean the
        same thing, and his feet will tend to always land on a stable,
        solid object of some sort. Any character trying to lead a
        horse into a deep Wyld area had better have the Spirit-Steadying
        Assurances Charm or something similar.

        &lt;br&gt;
        There are few of their abilities that the Exalted fear
        using. They are, after all, the anointed of the gods. They do
        not command Essence, it flows to match their desire. Even
        the most serious sorts of negligence or mistakes are only
        likely to lead to wild mood swings and misbehavior, not a
        grisly death. But even in the days of the Old Realm, the
        most powerful Solar Exalted used this Charm sparingly.&lt;br&gt;
        A character using this Charm can shape the primordial
        chaos, the inchoate precursor of reality, to his whim.
        Obviously, this Charm does not work in areas where the
        fabric of reality is already set — it must be used in the
        deepest, most fluid Wyld zones or else at the edge of the
        world, forcing shape into the teeth of the howling storm.&lt;br&gt;
        To activate this Charm, the character sets foot in the
        unformed substance of reality and wills it to take shape as he
        commands. The player rolls his character's Essence. Wyld-
        Shaping Technique is an extended action, with the cost of the
        Charm paid for each roll. The number of successes required is
        up to the Storyteller. The character can create nearly any-
        thing — a Demesne, a giant factory that produces golem
        warriors, a bag of diamonds as big as potatoes — but the larger
        and more powerful the thing he wishes to create, the more
        successes the player must roll. A single success would create
        a bag of diamonds or a talent of gold, while three successes
        would create a Demesne, a keep or a talent of one of the Five
        Magical Materials. Five successes would create a fortress, an
        enchanted forest complete with magical inhabitants or the
        aforementioned manufactory for golem warriors.&lt;br&gt;
        If the player botches at any time, horrible side effects result
        as reality shapes to the character's subconscious whims. It may
        take the shape of his fears or simply coalesce in some horrifically
        wrong fashion - the specifics are up to the Storyteller. They
        are rarely pleasant and often worse than fatal.&lt;br&gt;
        Objects created in this fashion are freshly minted. Lacking
        roots in reality, they are more subject to the gnawing of chaos
        than other items. This instability is really only a problem for
        large structures such as fortresses and cities - if such places are
        left unpeopled and not made part of the complex interplay of
        contact that makes up existence, they will slowly dissolve back
        into the chaos from which they sprang.

        No Exalted is an island. Through the use of this Charm, a
        character can transfer Essence motes to another character. Touse
        this Charm, the character must spend a turn in skin-to-skin
        contact with the target and burn 3 motes of Essence to power the
        Charm. She may then transfer to the target motes of Essence
        equal to 3 x her permanent Essence score. This Essence may not
        cause the target's Essence pool to rise above its normal maximum.
        If the target cannot accept all the transferred Essence, then the
        excess dissipates harmlessly. Characters may activate this Charm
        over successive turns to transfer large quantities of Essence but
        must pay the 3 motes for each turn the Charm is in use.

        Exalted can share more than simple power. The touch
        of a Solar can bring new strength to the downcast heart and
        new courage to the terrified. To use this Charm, the
        character must be in skin-to-skin contact with the target
        for a turn and must spend the Essence and Willpower to
        power the Charm. The character may then transfer a
        number of points of temporary Willpower to the target
        equal to the highest Virtue that the two of them share.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Dace is transferring Willpower to Swan.
        Dace has Valor 4, Conviction 2, Compassion 3, Temperance
        2. Swan has Valor 3, Conviction 2, Compassion 2, Temperance
        3. Dace can transfer up to three points of Temporary
        Willpower to Swan, one for each dot they share in Valor.&lt;br&gt;
        As with Essence-Lending Method, above, the Will-Bolstering
        Method cannot cause a character's temporary Willpower
        to rise above its normal maximum. Excess points are wasted.

        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted can give the
        gift of his very life energy. The character must be in skin-to-skin
        contact with the target for a turn and must spend a point of
        temporary Willpower and the appropriate amount of Essence.
        The Exalted using the Charm immediately takes a number of
        health levels of bashing damage, and the target of the Charm
        immediately heals a like number of levels of bashing or lethal
        damage. Exalted cannot share more health levels than the
        lower of the two character's Staminas. This Charm cannot heal
        aggravated damage, nor can it cause a character to gain more
        health levels than she would normally have. Exalted can, in
        fact, kill themselves through the use of this Charm.

        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted can lend some
        of her power to a normal mortal recipient. For each point of the
        loaning character's Essence, he can loan one Charm to the
        target. The target must have the appropriate minimum Ability
        to use the Charm, and if the Charms lent have prerequisite
        Charms, then the target must be lent those as well. The Charms
        draw directly on the Essence of the Exalted who lent them, but
        the recipient must pay any non-Essence costs. While the
        Charms are lent, the Exalted cannot use them. The Exalted can
        end the effect of this Charm and recall her power at any time.
        During the First Age, Exalted often used this ability to bolster
        their lictors and pages for important tasks.

            from the ravages of the Wyld for a single day. While it lasts,
            the earth and vegetation within the warded area, together
            with any living beings present inside it, will not be affected
            by the Wyld's changes, and the air will remain breathable
            and safe. The Solar paces around the area that he wishes to
            ward (which may not have more than a five yard radius per
            dot of permanent Essence that he has) and invokes the
            Charm. Unfortunately, although the contents of the area
            will be safe from change, faeries or Wyld-mutated beings
            are not prevented from entering the protected area.

            With this Charm, an Exalt may transfer his current
            injuries to another person. The character must be in skin-to-skin
            contact with the target of the Charm for a turn, and
            his player must spend a point of temporary Willpower and
            the appropriate amount of Essence. The Exalt's wounds
            close up and heal on his own body, while appearing at the
            same time on that of the subject. The Solar using the
            Charm immediately heals a number of health levels of
            bashing or lethal damage, and the target of the Charm
            immediately takes a like number of levels of bashing
            damage. The maximum number of health levels transfer-
            able is the lower of the two characters' Staminas. This
            Charm cannot be used to transfer aggravated damage:
            However, it is quite possible to kill somebody with it. It can
            be used in combat, but it requires that the character have
            concluded a successful grab or clinch maneuver and have
            the target trapped at the time the Charm is used.

            By means of this Charm, an Exalt can use his singular
            knowledge of both chaos and order to restore a Wyld-corrupted
            living creature or object. By placing his hands
            upon the target and focusing his will, the Solar can restore
            it to its original physical and mental state. However, any
            time that has passed will be taken into account: The target
            of the Charm will be restored to his appropriate age and
            may age significantly if the Wyld has preserved him from
            the passing years. For a full day after this Charm has been
            used, the target is immune to the effects of the Wyld:
            However, if he remains in Wyld areas after that time, he
            will once again be subject to its changes and may eventually
            be returned to his previous altered form. Note that this
            Charm does nothing to cure Wyld addiction - exposure
            to the energies of the madlands is still pleasurable.

            &lt;br&gt;
            By means of this Charm, a character can lend one of
            her spells to another Exalted sorcerer. For each dot of the
            loaning character's Essence, she can lend a spell for one
            use. The recipient must have the appropriate Sorcery
            Charm to be able to use the spell. These spells draw directly
            on the Essence of the Exalted who lent them, but the
            recipient must pay any non-Essence costs - for example
            the Willpower to activate the appropriate Sorcery Charm.&lt;br&gt;
            The Solar is still able to use these spells while the
            Charm is in effect, but as soon as the recipient has cast any
            of them as many times as the lending character has
            permanent Essence, the recipient loses the ability to cast
            that particular spell again. Use of this Charm does not aid
            in the study of the spell — it merely imprints the spell on
            the target, giving him the ability to use it once per dot of
            the lending character's Essence. Powerful Solars often
            used this ability to empower lesser minions — particularly
            the Dragon-Blooded - for particular missions.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt must spend an entire scene (30 minutes)
        boiling a small pot of water. During this time, she meditates
        and focuses her Essence into the water, transforming
        it into a deadly poison. The difficulty of the Stamina +
        Resistance roll to avoid the poison and the penalty it
        causes are both equal to the character's Lore Ability score.
        This penalty persists for a number of minutes equal to the
        character's permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        The damage done if the victim's player succeeds in
        making a successful Stamina + Resistance roll is equal to
        half of the brewing character's Lore (round up), and the
        damage done by the poison if the victim's player fails the
        roll is equal to twice the brewing character's Lore.&lt;br&gt;
        At the character's choice, the poison brewed can
        either bẻ a deadly toxin that does lethal damage or a
        powerful narcotic that only does bashing damage. Either
        poison must be ingested or delivered via a weapon to be
        effective Each pot made contains poison enough to
        envenom a dozen weapons or to poison a large meal. The
        poison is odorless, tasteless and colorless, requiring a
        Perception + Awareness roll of a difficulty equal to the
        brewing character's Essence to detect.&lt;br&gt;
        Like all other weapon venoms, each dose of poison
        can only be used against a single target. Once it has been
        used, the poison must be applied to the weapon again to
        be effective. The poison transforms back into harmless
        water after a week. Each batch must be brewed as either
        a thick weapon venom or an ingested venom that is as
        thin as water. Charms such as Poison-Resisting Medita-
        tion and Immunity to Everything Technique affect this
        poison normally.

            the poison brewed can either be a deadly toxin that does
            lethal damage or a powerful narcotic that only does
            bashing damage. Either poison must be ingested or enter

            dissipates harmlessly. This Charm cannot be used to

        through her own body, knitting broken bones and mending
        cut and burnt flesh with supernatural speed. When this
        Charm is active, the character heals at 10 times the normal

        Charm works only on the Exalted herself and cannot be used
        on others. This Charm does not speed the healing of aggravated
        damage, nor does it allow the regeneration of amputated
        or destroyed tissue — a character who loses an eye or hand will
        have to seek more powerful magical remedies. Characters can
        activate this Charm even if unconscious.

        his medical abilities to an unearthly degree. By examining
        a patient closely and hearing about her symptoms, the
        character can flawlessly diagnose her illness. Note that this
        is an improvement of the character's perception, not
        access to a vast store of medical wisdom - knowledge of
        formal medicine is a function of the character's Medicine
        and Lore skills. If the character has never heard of a disease,
        she will only be able to diagnose its general type and
        determine if it is magical in nature or not. The character's
        ability to actually treat the disease will be strictly contingent
        on her skill as a physician. However, regardless of her
        degree of skill, she will never misdiagnose a disease, mis-
        taking one she doesn't know for one she does.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Charm Ailment-Rectifying Method allows an
        Exalted to recover rapidly from even the most serious
        illness. Non-life-threatening illnesses dissipate immediately.
        The player of a character suffering from a more
        serious ailment may make a Stamina + Resistance roll
        (without any wound or disease-related penalties). Success
        indicates that the character's illness fades over the
        course of the Charm's duration. Very serious diseases may
        require two or more successes, so it may take a character
        several days of use to accumulate enough successes to
        recover fully. However, even the most serious illnesses
        are halted in their progress by this Charm, and even the
        Great Contagion requires but five accumulated successes
        to overcome. Note that this Charm can only be used on
        the Exalted herself - to heal others of sickness, the
        Exalted must use Contagion-Curing Touch.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through the use of this Charm, the character can
        successfully treat serious or even normally incurable diseases.
        The Exalted's player makes an Intelligence +
        Medicine roll. Normal diseases are cured with a single
        success, while more serious ailments may require as many
        as five successes. Regardless of success, once treatment has
        begun, the course of the disease is halted, and unless use of
        this Charm is discontinued, the illness will grow no worse.
        No medicine is required, though the person being treated
        must be bathed, kept warm, fed well and given all the other
        prerequisites of bed rest. The Exalted himself must perform
        this care and, as a result, cannot treat more individuals
        during a given day than his score in the Medicine Ability.

        The Touch of Blissful Release allows the character to
        lessen the suffering of wounded or ill individuals, dulling
        their pains and easing the discomforts of illness. Wounded
        characters reduce their wound penalties by two, and sick
        characters likewise ignore up to two dice of negative
        symptoms. However, Touch of Blissful Release has a
        narcotic effect as well as an analgesic one, and characters
        under its influence are at a -3 die penalty to performing any
        action that requires thought, memory or coordination.

        By channeling Essence through her body, the character
        can increase her rate of healing immensely. Over the
        duration of the Charm, which must be spent in bed rest,
        the character heals health levels equal to her Essence score
        plus a number of additional health levels equal to the
        number of successes the character's player achieves on a
        Stamina + Endurance roll. This Charm does not speed the

        of amputated or destroyed tissue.

        Similar in effect to Grievous Injury Recovery Method,
        this Charm allows the character to heal others at an
        incredible pace. For each day the character spends treating
        the subject (who must rest in bed during the treatment),
        she heals health levels equal to her permanent Essence
        plus a number of additional levels equal to the number of
        successes her player achieves on an Intelligence + Medicine
        roll. A character cannot tend to more than one
        individual undergoing Wound-Mending Care Technique
        at a time. This Charm does not speed the healing of
        aggravated damage, nor does it allow the regeneration of
        amputated or destroyed tissue.

        injuries with nothing but a touch. Where the character's
        Essence-charged hands go, shattered bones are made whole
        and torn flesh is instantly mended. With each use of this
        Charm, the character instantly heals a number of health
        levels equal to his Essence score. The Exalted cannot heal
        herself with this Charm. This Charm does not speed the
        healing of aggravated damage, nor does it allow the regeneration
        of amputated or destroyed tissue.

        The character enters a healing trance, during which he
        loses all awareness of the world around him. For every hour
        he is in this trance, he heals a number of health levels equal
        to his Essence score. This healing trance will cure aggravated
        damage, as well as allow the regrowth of destroyed
        tissues, amputated limbs, lost eyes and so forth. Eyes, tongues,
        hands, feet, mouths full of smashed teeth and other lesser
        maimings are the equivalent of a health level. Lost limbs are
        the equivalent of two health levels and, so, take two hours
        each to regrow. During the period the Exalted is so entranced,
        she regains no Essence - prolonged periods of
        healing can leave a Solar helpless before her enemies.

        Health, Bodily Regeneration Prana
        Similar to the Charm Bodily Regeneration Prana, the
        Healing Trance Meditation Charm allows the character to
        heal similarly serious injuries in others. The Exalted must
        touch her target, and the target must be cooperative. Both
        she and the target fall into a healing trance, during which
        they have no awareness of the outside world. For each hour
        they remain in this trance, the target heals a number of
        health levels equal to the Exalted's Essence score. As with
        Healing Trance Meditation, this Charm can heal aggravated
        damage and replace lost limbs and other, similar
        maimings. The times required to heal these injuries are as
        for Bodily Regeneration Prana, above. Neither of the
        characters involved regains Essence during the healing
        period (assuming that the target has any Essence to regain
        — he may, after all, be an unExalted mortal).&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Errata:&lt;br&gt;
        Healing Trance Meditation refers twice to itself as if it were a different Charm. The text is actually
        referring to Bodily Regeneration Prana.

            With this Charm, an Exalted can cleanse another
            character of any addiction that she may have to alcohol or
            to more noxious substances, such as opium, bright morn-
            ing, lotus distillate or fire butterfly wing-powder. The
            character places her hand on the subject's brow and
            invokes the Charm, instantly freeing the subject from all
            psychological and physiological effects and cravings of the
            addiction. However, the stresses and temptations that
            drove the subject to addiction in the first place will not be
            banished and may, quite possibly, cause the subject to
            relapse. An Exalt cannot use this Charm upon herself.

            &lt;br&gt;
            In a sense the diametric opposite to the Wound-Mending
            Care Technique, this Charm allows the
            character to inflict particularly grievous wounds, which
            will heal far more slowly than normal. By spending 10
            motes of Peripheral Essence and 1 point of temporary
            Willpower, the character focuses his blows through his
            understanding of anatomy and Essence flows, so that all
            aggravated and lethal damage he inflicts will take five
            times as long to heal, and all bashing damage will take 10
            times as long to heal. If healing Charms are later used on
            the target, they function at half their usual efficacy.
            Twilight Exalted frequently used this Charm in duels
            during the First Age.

            With this Charm, an Exalted can heal not only
            wounded bodies, but also salve damaged minds and souls.
            While the character must touch the subject of the Charm,
            the subject need not be cooperative or willing — in fact,
            if he suffers from a particularly violent form of insanity,
            he may need to be restrained in some way. Both the
            Exalted and the target pass into a deep healing trance, in
            which they remain for an entire day. The only way of
            forcibly breaking the trance before the day is over is
            either to separate the two physically or to slay one of
            them, in which case the other awakens. During the
            period that the Exalted is entranced, he regains no
            Essence. If the Charm is completed, then the subject
            awakens with a clear and rational mind, free from all
            forms of insanity. While this Charm will also heal the
            effects on a soul of the Fair Folk's hunger and cure
            sorcerous forms of madness, it will not necessarily alter a
            target's morality or cause a person to change strongly held
            views. An Exalted cannot use this Charm upon himself:
            If he is suffering from some form of insanity, then someone
            else must use the Charm on him. Also, the Charm
            cannot cure the Great Curse.

            One of the most legendary of Charms, it allows an
            Exalt to restore youth and health to a normal human or
            animal. However, it cannot restore another Exalted or a
            magical being, as it only works on purely natural creatures.
            The character invokes the Charm, touching the target
            (who must be willing) and spending 15 motes of Peripheral
            Essence, 1 Willpower and 1 experience point. The target
            instantly and visibly grows young again, becoming as
            healthy and attractive as he was when a young adult (18
            years old for humans, proportionally younger for animals),
            though retaining all his skills and knowledge. The effect
            lasts for a single year; if it is not renewed at the end of the
            year, then the subject's lost years will be visited upon him
            once again. The legends of this Charm are generally not
            believed: Were it known that Exalts could actually per-
            form such a deed, it is likely that many unscrupulous and
            powerful persons would be extremely interested.

        needed to perform magic of the so-called First Circle. Note
        that the cost of the Charm is only to enable the character to
        cast a single spell. The actual spell itself has an Essence cost,
        often very high, that the character must pay to actualize the
        spell. This cost is listed in the spell's description. For
        descriptions of spells, see the &amp;quot;Sorcery&amp;quot; section on page 215.
        Terrestrial Circle Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.

        Similar to, but more powerful than, magic of the
        Terrestrial Circle, Celestial Circle magic is mighty indeed.
        Dragon-Blooded and mortals are unable to practice this
        form of magic, but Celestial Exalted can. It is worth noting
        that there are only a handful of individuals in the world
        who know the secrets of Celestial Circle magic. Characters
        who wish to learn magic of this circle will have to find
        these entities and convince them to share their wisdom.

        The most powerful form of magic available to the
        Exalted. Sorcery of the Solar Circle rivals the anger of the Five
        Elemental Dragons in its power. Only the Solar Exalted can
        practice magic of this magnitude, and most of it was lost after
        the murder of the Solars, many centuries ago. As a result, there
        are practically no spells of the Solar Circle left outside the
        Imperial Library. Characters who wish to reclaim the sorcerous
        power that is their legacy without centuries of magical
        research will have to either search far and wide for magic or
        else bargain with the Yozis and Deathlords for such scraps of
        power as they can be persuaded to part with. Solar Circle
        Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the character to perceive
        unmanifested spirits. Normally, spirits must manifest (appear
        but remain intangible) or materialize (appear in physical
        form) to be perceived. However, characters with this Charm
        can see spirits when they have done neither. Spirits in their
        natural form appear much as they do when manifested or
        materialized, though the character can clearly distinguish
        them from those that are actually visible. Note that this
        Charm does not make the character any more able to strike
        or harm spirits, though it does make it much easier for her to
        direct her attacks. For more information on spirits and their
        powers, see the Antagonists chapter, page 289.

        Prerequisite Charms: Spirit-Detecting Glance&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the character to launch a single
        attack at an unmanifested spirit. For the purposes of the
        individual attack, the character attacks the spirit as if it
        was manifested normally. Characters who do not have
        Spirit-Detecting Glance active (or who are not using some
        other means of perceiving spirits) will be attacking blind
        — a +2 difficulty modifier. Spirits killed via Spirit-Cutting
        Attack will eventually regenerate, but this process takes
        some time (potentially decades) and is quite unpleasant
        for the spirit. Spirit-Cutting Attack is explicitly permitted
        to be part of a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        Prerequisite Charms: Spirit-Cutting Attack&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is similar to Spirit-Cutting Attack, but the
        character's blows are much more dangerous. Name aside, the
        character does not actually place the spirit into her mouth,
        though she does consume its Essence, and its death at her
        hands is permanent. A blow struck using this Charm does
        aggravated damage to unmaterialized spirits and drains away
        motes of the spirit's Essence equal to twice the character's
        permanent Essence, which are added to the character's own
        store of motes. Drained motes that would take the character
        above her normal maximum are still drained but dissipate
        without benefit to the Exalted. Spirits that have materialized
        are no longer vulnerable to the Ghost-Eating Technique.
        This Charm is the weapon by which the Exalted slew the
        enemies of the gods, and spirits hate and fear it. The Ghost-Eating
        Technique is explicitly permitted to be part of a
        Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        Through the use of this Charm, characters can drive away
        unmaterialized spirits from an area and bar them from entry. The
        character spreads her arms, and a blazing circle of gold-white light
        erupts a number of yards in radius equal to the character's Essence.
        All unmaterialized spirits within the diagram who have a lower
        maximum Essence pool than the character must either flee the
        warded area or materialize. Unmaterialized spirits outside the
        diagram with maximum Essence pools lower than the character's
        may not use their Charms to effect those within the diagram, nor
        may they enter it. Spirits that have materialized are no longer

        &lt;br&gt;
        This powerful Charm allows a character to perceive the
        flows of Essence at work in the world around him. Far more
        detailed than Spirit-Detecting Glance or the intuition for
        magic at work that every sorcerer possesses, this Charm allows
        characters to actually see the Essence of the world. Characters
        can not only perceive spirits, they can also see the great gauzy
        rivers of the dragon tracks and the shatteringly brilliant fountains
        and spires of Manses and Demesnes. Exalted using this
        Charm can distinguish the diamond-bright lattices of Charms
        and sorcery at work, allowing them to spot most enchantments
        without the need for any roll. With a successful Intelligence +
        Occult roll, a character can even identify the kind of enchantment
        and (if he is sufficiently familiar with her handiwork) the
        Exalted who caused the magic to come into existence.

            &lt;br&gt;
            By giving voice to the arcane patterns of this Charm,
            an Exalted can hamper an enemy's ability to use Essence.
            The character must be within a number of yards of the
            target equal to his Essence. The Solar's player and target's
            player must both make Will + Occult rolls: If the Solar's
            player scores more successes, then for the turn when this
            Charm is used and in every subsequent turn in which the
            character spends 5 motes of Essence, the chosen subject of
            the Charm must pay twice as much Essence to use any of
            his Charms or other Essence-fueled abilities. If the target
            scores more successes, then the Charm fails to function.
            While this Charm does not require continuous concentration
            by the Exalt, only the continued expenditure of
            Essence, and counts as the use of a simple Charm every
            turn, it will be nullified if the Solar using it is rendered
            unconscious or killed. This Charm may never be used as
            part of a Combo, nor does it affect beings with an Essence
            equal to or greater than the character.

            &lt;br&gt;
            With a barehanded blow, the character using this
            Charm makes it impossible for his target to make any
            directed use of Essence for that turn and, potentially, for
            later turns. It must be used with a successful barehanded
            attack (which need do no damage but must penetrate
            the target's block or dodge) and is specifically permitted
            to be used as part of a Combo with Charms of other
            Abilities. The character may maintain the Charm as
            long as she continues to spend 10 motes of Peripheral
            Essence and 1 permanent Willpower for each turn that
            it is in use. This count's as the character's Charm use for
            the turn, as long as se continues to spend 7 motes and 1
            temporary Willpower per turn.&lt;br&gt;
            The target — whether he is an Exalt, a spirit, one of
            the Fair Folk or anything else — will be unable to use any
            Essence-driven powers and must react on a purely physical
            level. Note that creatures that are magically aflame or that
            have magical venom are not restricted by this Charm, as
            such prodigies are expressions of their fundamental beings,
            and this attack bars only the working of magic. Likewise,
            this Charm cannot stop Lunar shapeshifting or the display
            and use of anima banners. Should the Solar invoking the
            Charm be rendered unconscious or killed, the magic is
            broken. It is whispered that there are more powerful
            versions of this Charm, which can suppress the powers of
            an Exalted for days, years or permanently, but if so, they are
            still not yet rediscovered.

            An Exalted can use this Charm to ward a building or
            room from unwanted entry by spirits. For the Charm to
            function, the area being warded must have a clearly defined
            main entrance and may not be larger than 20 yards
            square. The Exalt invokes the Charm by tracing his Caste
            Mark upon the main door of the area — or on the ground,
            if there is no actual door — to seal the entrance. Dematerialized
            spirits outside the warded area with permanent
            Essence lower than the character's may not use their
            Charms to affect those within the warded area, nor may
            they enter it unless invited by those within. Should they
            attempt to enter, whether or not they succeed, the mark
            upon the entrance blazes bright gold, visible to anybody
            nearby. This ward is a continuing effect that lasts until the
            room is broken or the ward is deliberately defiled by a being
            that is not a spirit.

        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted channels
        Essence through his body, making it extraordinarily limber, deft
        and light. For the remainder of the scene, the character has near-perfect
        balance and can stand on things far too narrow and weak
        to normally support him (the tips of pine trees, horizontal
        flagpoles, roof gables and so forth) with no fear of falling or
        breaking the object. The Storyteller may wish to call for Athletics
        rolls in the most extraordinary of circumstances (the character is
        leaping from branch to branch on a moonless night in a
        snowstorm), but generally, the character can run along even the
        narrowest ledges orstand on the flimsiest perches with no worries.

        damage he inflicts is doubled after it is rolled. Characters
        cannot move during a turn when they use Thunderbolt

        dash upside down across horizontal surfaces such as ceilings
        or the undersides of tree limbs. This not only allows
        the Exalted to circumvent many obstacles, it also allows
        her to bypass shields or move behind enemies. Storytellers
        should assign bonuses as appropriate.
        If the character is in a position she could not naturally hold
        (fighting while standing upside down on a ceiling, for example)
        and fails to spend Essence on Spider-Foot Style during a turn,
        she becomes subject to the normal forces of gravity and inertia
        again and may be seriously injured in the resulting fall.

        The Exalted lightens her footfalls with Essence and spreads
        her weight, allowing her to walk or run across fluid surfaces such as
        water, quicksand, loose sand, acid, lava, lakes of writhing maggots
        and the like. The character may traverse such surfaces just as if they
        were solid earth during a turn in which she uses this Charm. Note
        that the bottom of the character's feet are still touching the
        material, so barefoot or lightly shod characters running across acid
        or lava or man-eating maggots are still risking serious injury.
        As with Spider-Foot Style, if the character fails to spend
        Essence on this Charm during a turn in which she is standing
        on a fluid, she becomes subject to the normal laws of gravity and
        buoyancy. All but the most lightly burdened character will risk
        death by drowning (or worse, in the case of more exotic fluids).

        The character flashes toward his opponent, attacking
        as he blurs past her. The character makes the attack as
        normal, but the amount of damage he does is doubled after
        soak but before damage is rolled.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can move up to his normal sprinting distance
        without penalty in the turn he launches the Leaping Tiger Attack.
        The character need not move this far — the attack needs only a
        yard or so - but the character cannot be bound or otherwise
        unable to move when he launches the attack. This means that
        Thunderbolt Attack Prana and Leaping Tiger Attack cannot be
        part of the same Combo. Leaping Tiger Attack is explicitly
        permitted to be part of a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        The character attunes himself to his own Essence and
        that of the world around him and moves as though in a
        waking dream. He travels in great, graceful leaps, over the
        ground, off roofpeaks, from tree limb to tree limb. Moving
        in this fashion, the character can traverse a number of
        miles per hour equal to his (Stamina + Essence) × 10.&lt;br&gt;
        This state is trancelike and ends if the character stops
        for any reason. Likewise, the character is not preternaturally
        aware of his location, and his perceptions of the world
        beyond the next leap are often hazy, at best. He will notice
        only the most urgent stimuli (very large landmarks, hordes
        of hobgoblins ambushing him) and can easily become lost
        when traveling through areas he is unfamiliar with.

        This Charm allows a character to increase her Strength
        tremendously for short periods of time. For every 3 motes
        of Essence the character spends, her Strength increases by
        1. A character cannot increase her Strength by more than
        her Essence rating through the use of this Charm. The
        Strength lent by this Charm increases the damage of the
        character's attacks, just as if it were normal Strength.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through the use of this Charm, the character can
        increase his Strength even further. For every 2 motes of
        Essence the character spends, he may increase his Strength
        + Athletics by one for the purposes of lifting and breaking
        objects. The character can no more than double his regular
        Strength + Athletics pool through the use of this Charm -
        keep in mind that the Charm Increasing Strength Exercise
        counts as a bonus, and thus, its bonus cannot be doubled
        through the use of this Charm. If the character makes an
        attack with the intent of destroying an inanimate object,
        each point adds one to the character's raw damage. This
        Charm does not increase the amount of damage the charac-
        ter does in combat.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By burning vast quantities of Essence, a character can
        increase his physical might greatly for a few moments. For
        every mote of Essence the character spends on this Charm,
        he can increase his Strength + Athletics by 2 for the
        purposes of a single attempt to lift or break something. If it
        is used to aid a character in a hand-to-hand attack to break
        or destroy an object, each mote spent adds two to the raw
        damage of the attack. A character cannot burn more motes
        of Essence powering this Charm than he has points of
        permanent Willpower. Ten Ox Meditation does not increase
        the damage of a character's attacks against animate
        beings, though it can cause indirect damage. For example,
        if the character pulls down the main pillars of a temple,
        those inside will probably be killed or injured.

            cannot swim in armor, he can swim at his normal movement
            rate and never needs to worry about drowning in
            relatively calm water. This Charm reduces the difficulty
            of all Athletics rolls related to swimming by 1 (to a
            minimum of 1).

            wearing no more than light armor. In addition, she swims
            underwater easily and can hold her breath for up to
            Stamina x 10 minutes - each success on a Stamina +
            Resistance roll extends this time by 10 minutes. She can
            swim in the worst seas without risk of drowning, and her
            player need never make Athletics rolls for the character
            to stay afloat. Although the character cannot swim if
            wearing anything heavier than light armor, she can still
            walk along the bottom while holding her breath. This
            Charm reduces the difficulty of all Athletics rolls related
            to swimming by 3 (to a minimum of 1).

            As a part of any attack, the character may vault over
            the head of any foe she is facing. At the end of this vault,
            the character lands behind the foe and may attack this
            opponent from behind. This attack does no additional
            damage, but it gains all of the benefits of attacking from
            behind (see Exalted, p. 238). Normally, this Charm can
            only be used once on a given foe — enemies who are
            expecting this maneuver can pivot around rapidly enough
            to parry or dodge attacks. However, against the unsuspecting,
            this is often a devastating technique.

            she can leap (Strength + Athletics) x TO yards.
            vertically or twice this distance horizontally, The character
            can attack and perform other actions in the same turn
            that she performs Soaring Crane Leap but gains no special
            bonuses to these actions. If desired, this Charm can be
            used to leap down from great heights, effectively making
            the character almost immune to falling damage.

            This Charm allows the character to leap long distances
            in a single bound, which takes the remainder of
            the scene (or about five minutes in real time). The
            character can cover a distance of five miles per point of
            permanent Essence. If he does not know his destination,
            his player may be required to make a successful reflexive
            Dexterity + Athletics roll on the Exalt's landing or have
            him tumble and potentially take up to three dice of
            bashing damage. The character may take no other ac-
            tions except to parry and counterattack during the scene
            he's leaping. If the character can fly or otherwise navi-
            gate through air, doing so immediately ends this Charm's
            effect and leaves the character dependent on whatever
            means of locomotion he activated. A character can
            reach a height of several miles at the apex of the leap, so
            flight effects of short duration are suicidal unless the
            character can survive such a long fall.

        The character can focus her Essence to actually
        repel the ground — she leaps and will continue to move
        through the air for the rest of the scene. The character
        moves with a speed up to triple her sprinting distance per
        turn. She can effectively fly like a bird, but she must keep
        moving at no less than half her sprinting distance every
        turn, or she will have to land and end the Charm.
        Though she can &amp;quot;climb&amp;quot; higher obstacles such as walls
        and cliffs by zooming along the vertical surface, a character
        flying with this Charm cannot naturally maintain
        an altitude higher above the ground (or whatever flat,
        stable surface lies below her) than three times her
        normal vertical leaping distance - so, no more than 3
        x her Strength + Athletics in yards.&lt;br&gt;
        To direct the flows of Essence, the character must
        keep one arm extended out in front of her. As a result, she
        cannot use bows or any other two handed weapons while
        flying. However, she may use thrown weapons, fight
        unarmed or wield one-handed hand-to-hand weapons
        normally, regardless of how fast she is moving. The
        character can engage in aerial duels with opponents
        capable of taking to the air, or she can hut thrown
        weapons at foes on the ground or swoop down and strike
        them as she flies past.&lt;br&gt;
        Flying characters may be attacked only by ranged
        attacks, by other flying or leaping characters or on the
        initiative count when they attack someone on the
        ground. Keep in mind that any foe who rolled a higher
        initiative can delay his action and attack the character
        as she swoops by. People other than the character's
        target who attempt to strike the Exalt as she swoops in
        for the attack do so at - 3 dice (due to the Exalt's speed),
        unless they are using long weapons such as spears or
        poleaxes. In such cases, the penalty is reduced to -1.
        The Exalt's target can attack the Exalt normally and
        without penalty, but only during the initiative count in
        which he, the target, is attacked. Otherwise, he must
        use some sort of ranged attack.&lt;br&gt;

        Though the use of this Charm, the character extends
        his perception, heightening all five senses. The
        character can see farther and in less light, hear softer
        sounds and distinguish between them more easily and
        differentiate various tastes, textures and scents quite
        easily — he could be a master chef or perfumer. The
        basic mechanical effect is to increase the character's
        Awareness by a number of dice equal to his Essence,
        though there are obviously many other situations where
        these senses might come into play — it's up to the
        Storyteller to make a character's extended perceptions
        a reality by increasing the amount of information available
        to the player. Characters using this Charm are not
        any more or less vulnerable to sensory overload than
        normal mortals - the extended perceptions include
        the ability to manage the sensations more effectively.

        Prerequisite Charms: Sensory Acuity Prana&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character channels Essence into one of his senses,
        heightening his perceptions to an immense degree. When
        he purchases this Charm, the character must choose which
        sense it affects. Characters may purchase this Charm more
        than once in order to gain the ability to heighten different
        senses. However, a character may not have more than one
        sense heightened at any given time. Generally, this Charm
        does not add dice to a character's pools, but instead,
        changes what actions she can undertake at a given difficulty.
        For example, recognizing someone by her scent is
        normally difficulty 2 or 3, but a character with Keen Smell
        and Taste Technique could do it without a roll.&lt;br&gt;
        The effects of various Keen (Sense) Techniques are
        listed below&lt;br&gt;
        • Sight — The character's visual acuity is heightened
        to several times that of a normal mortal. He can pick out
        tiny details at 100 yards, quickly count masses of troops and
        so on. In fog, dusk and other poor visual conditions, he can
        see as well as a normal person in good visual conditions.&lt;br&gt;
        • Hearing and Touch - The character's hearing and
        sense of touch are tremendously increased. The character
        can easily judge the quality of fabric and metals with casual
        inspection, hear animals burrowing beneath the ground,
        listen in clearly on conversations through thick doors and
        perform other, similar feats.&lt;br&gt;
        • Smell and Taste - The character can detect poisons
        by taste and smell and recognize individuals by their scents
        (even if they are no longer present). The character may track
        by scent but is not good at it — add a + 2 bonus to all Survival
        rolls involving tracking or hunting for food.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is incompatible with Sensory Acuity
        Prana, above. The character can either extend all her
        senses or one of them.

        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Keen (Sense) Technique
        The character channels Essence to hone one of her
        senses As with Keen (Sense) Technique, above, the character
        must choose a sense to be enhanced when she
        purchases this Charm. The Charm may be purchased
        multiple times to cover multiple senses, but the character
        may not invoke Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline and Keen
        (Sense) Technique at the same time, and only one sense
        at a time can be enhanced via the Unsurpassed (Sense)
        Discipline Charm. A character can only purchase the
        Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline Charm for a sense for
        which she has already purchased the Keen (Sense) Technique
        Charm. Also, as with Keen (Sense) Technique, this
        Charm is incompatible with Sensory Acuity Prana.&lt;br&gt;
        • Sight - The character gains eyes equal to those of
        the greatest raptors. In good light, the character can see a
        field mouse a mile away, pick a face out of a crowded street
        with a casual glance and detect the tiniest details and
        imperfections without effort. In the dark or in poor visual
        conditions such as smoke, haze and mist, her senses are
        diminished, and she sees only as well as an individual using
        Keen Sight Technique does in normal conditions.&lt;br&gt;
        • Hearing and Touch - The character can listen in
        on a whispered conversation a mile away in still air or 100
        yards away indoors, in windy conditions or in noisy situations
        such as a bazaar or coliseum. The character can read
        by passing her fingers over a page and feeling the ink
        beneath her fingertips.&lt;br&gt;
        • Smell and Taste - The character can track by scent
        almost as well as a bloodhound, adding his Perception as
        automatic successes to all Survival rolls involving tracking or
        hunting for food. She can distinguish poisons at a distance by
        scent alone and can tell how much and how recently some-
        thing was poisoned with but a harmless touch of the tongue.
        She can read an individual or animal's actual mood by scent.

        Prerequisite Charms: Sensory Acuity Prana&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The character develops a preternatural sense for haz-
        ard. Whenever she is about to be placed in immediate
        danger, her Surprise Anticipation Method activates. There
        is no roll - the character simply becomes aware of
        immanent danger. This effect costs a mote of Essence and
        makes it almost impossible to ambush the character. Storytellers
        should keep in mind that Surprise Anticipation
        Method is an asset, not a liability. Don't use it as an excuse
        to drain the character's Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        Storytellers should also keep in mind that Surprise
        Anticipation Method operates by increasing the character's
        awareness, not by precognition or mind reading. It alerts
        characters to anything they would perceive as dangerous if
        they saw it and gave it a quick glance. A character with
        Surprise Anticipation Method can occasionally guess wrong
        about an individual's intentions, particularly when on
        edge. While the character will detect invisible individuals
        from subtle environmental clues, she can fall into carefully
        concealed pits, and she can be taken by surprise by the
        unexpected treachery of a trusted friend. She is not pre-
        scient so much as nearly impossible to catch flat-footed.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters may place other Charms in a Combo with
        Surprise Anticipation Method. When Surprise Anticipation
        Method activates, the character has the option of spending a
        point of temporary Willpower and activating the rest of the
        Charms. However, she must do this immediately upon the
        activation of Surprise Anticipation Method. Most Exalted
        Combo in defensive Charms since, while Surprise Anticipation
        Method is generally reliable, it is hardly infallible. It only takes
        one accidentally murdered loved one or terrible diplomatic
        incident to make an Exalted into a broken or hunted creature.

            This Charm allows the user to see in darkness as if she
            were in broad daylight. The Exalted needs no light source
            of any kind, so long as this Charm is in effect; whether
            down in the deepest cave or under a new moon on a cloudy
            night, she will see with normal clarity and detail. Charms
            used to increase her vision will work just like they normally
            do; if she uses the Hundred Leagues Sight Procedure
            (below) after activating this Charm, she will be able to
            flawlessly focus on a target dozens of leagues away, as if in
            daylight. As with the Sensory Acuity Prana (see Exalted,
            p. 196), the Exalted is not more or less susceptible to bright
            lights or sudden flashes. If she enters a torch-lit tent, she
            will see normally, and if suddenly startled by the flare of an
            anima banner, she will be blinded no longer than someone
            using his ordinary senses would.

            &lt;br&gt;
            The Exalted shifts his vision so that he can see in
            water as if in air. For the duration of the Charm, he can
            adjust his vision to see in water, in air or to see through
            them both. While shifted to see in either water or air, he
            sees normally. When looking through both (as when
            peering over the railing of a vessel to see if there is anything
            in the waters below or when looking up onto the deck of
            a ship from below the water's surface to locate a guard), he
            sees without the distortions and shifting that normally
            occurs, but his vision is halved (see &amp;quot;Vision in the Depths,&amp;quot;
            this page). It takes one turn to change sight over from
            water to air or from either to seeing in both.

            &lt;br&gt;
            Whereas, before, the Exalted could extend his vision
            out to a mile or more using the Unsurpassed Sight Discipline,
            with this Charm, he can see further than even the
            sharpest-eyed mospid. The user of this Charm can clearly
            focus and notice details out to a range equal to his (Essence
            x 20) miles. Anything within that range can be seen just
            as if it were close to hand — even the furthest objects will
            appear as if they were no more than 100 yards or so away.
            This ability is rarely of use on land, where terrain ensures
            that the Exalted will never actually be able to see that far,
            but at sea, the information gleaned may prove vital.

            a clear night under the full moon or in a totally lightless
            cell 10 yards underground. The only sign that a character
            is using this Charm is that her eyes become somewhat
            luminescent in dim light, flashing Solar gold from certain
            angles. This Charm does not allow the character to see
            more easily through fog or smoke, nor does it help her

            a safe. The character cannot actually interact with the

            or mundane disguises is seen in their true form, even a
            Lunar Exalted whose Tell has not yet been spotted or an
            Immaculate using Shrouding the Body and Mind. Every-
            one who is hiding is revealed to the character's gaze,
            regardless of whether they are using ordinary Stealth or
            potent invisibility magics, including mind altering effects
            such as Mental Invisibility Technique, Everyone
            and everything that was deliberately disguised or hidden
            can be clearly seen. No known magic can deceive the
            power of this Charm - Eye of the Unconquered Sun is a
            perfect defense against invisibility and concealment.
            When a character uses this Charm, his Caste Mark glows
            as if the Exalt's anima banner were at the 12-15 mote level
            if it does not already, shattering all illusion and invisibil-
            ity Charms and making mundane stealth impossible.

        The character's attunement to the interaction of her
        anima with the ambient Essence of Creation makes her
        preternaturally aware of her surroundings. By using this
        Charm, she may dodge attacks that she is not even aware of.
        If the character is attacked, even by an attack she does not
        anticipate, she may spend 2 motes of Essence to attempt to
        evade the attack. The character's dice pool for dodging such
        attacks is equal to (2 x her permanent Essence score).
        Reflex Sidestep Technique cannot be used as part of
        a Combo with other Dodge Charms. Although the character
        does not perceive the situation until she has already
        dodged, the player may choose whether or not the character
        spends the Essence to dodge the blow. If she chooses to
        dodge, she must spend the Essence to do so before the
        attacker makes his roll.

        The character permeates his being with Essence,
        becoming partly atomized. He moves with an impossible
        fluid grace, and those attacks that he cannot dodge often
        pass harmlessly through his dreamlike body. For the rest of
        the scene, the character may use his full Dexterity + Dodge
        dice pool to dodge all physical attacks, perceived or not.

            &lt;br&gt;
            When attacked, the Exalted makes a prodigious leap
            to take herself out of harms way. When making any dodge
            using this Charm, the character avoids the attack by
            leaping up to (Strength + Athletics) x 3 yards vertically
            or twice this distance horizontally. The Exalt can choose
            the exact direction and distance of this leap, so long as it
            is away from her attacker. Leaping Dodge Method is
            explicitly permitted to be part of a Combo with any Dodge
            Charms, including Reflex Sidestep Technique. This
            Charm will break multiple attack techniques if the attacker
            cannot follow the dodging character.

        This Charm grants a character preternatural intuition
        with regard to criminal subcultures. While under the influence
        of this Charm, he can easily pick out criminal establishments
        - pawnshops willing to operate as fences, taverns that are
        thieves' havens and so on. Likewise, the character can easily
        pick out those who are actively interested in buying or selling
        illegal goods and services — he canspot police and officials who
        will accept bribes and individuals interested in selling or buying
        drugs, sex or information. Finally, the character using this
        Charm can easily read lines of power, differentiating important
        organized crime figures from small-time operators and quickly
        tracking down the true thrones and powers of the local underworld.
        In short, characters with this Charm are at home in any
        criminal subculture. This Charm doesn't grant the ability to
        spot agents provocateurs and informers.

        By means of this Charm, the character can disguise her
        appearance, her voice and even her scent. The player may not
        imitate a specific individual, but may alter her apparent age by
        as much as 20 years (minimum 16), her ethnicity, her height
        by as much as six inches and her gender. It is impossible to see
        through the character's disguise via mundane means. Characters
        using this Charm can sometimes be detected via the
        Unsurpassed (Sense) Discipline Charm or by the All-Encompassing
        Sorcerer's Sight Charm - in these cases, the matter
        is resolved as normal for disguise attempts — an opposed roll
        of the disguised character's Wits + Larceny versus the
        Perception + Awareness of the character attempting to detect him.

        from the real individual. The character must know the target well
        to perfectly mirror him - at least well enough to imitate him
        through mundane disguise (see the Drama chapter, page 255, for
        rules on disguise). Also, while this Charm covers small mannerisms,
        responses to in-jokes and so forth, it does not grant the
        character access to the mirrored character's memories, so she will
        not be able to use passwords she does not know, recall facts the
        Exalted herself is not familiar with and so forth.

        Prerequisite Charms: Flawless Pickpocketing Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is much like Flawless Pickpocketing Technique,
        allowing a character to steal an item without any
        chance of being caught in the act. However, an Exalted
        utilizing Stealing From Plain Sight Spirit can steal an item
        from plain view, for example stealing a brooch from a table,
        a key from a jailer's keyring or a sword from its scabbard.
        Unless attention is somehow drawn to the act (for example,
        a guard will notice his sword was stolen if he attempts to
        draw it, and a jailer will notice a key is missing if he attempts
        to unlock a door with it), the theft will go unnoticed for at
        least number of turns equal to the character's Essence rating.&lt;br&gt;
        As with Flawless Pickpocketing Technique, the character
        must be close enough to touch the object she wishes to
        steal. Note that the item cannot be actively in use when it is
        stolen - for instance, you cannot use Stealing From Plain
        Sight Spirit to steal the pen or sword out of someone's hand.

        This Charm is similar to Stealing From Plain Sight
        Spirit, in that it allows objects to be stolen from plain view
        without their loss being noticed for a number of turns equal
        to the Essence score of the character using the Charm
        (unless some special notice is drawn to the fact that the
        object is no longer present). However, Magpie's Invisible
        Talon allows the character to steal an object from up to one
        yard away per point of her Essence score. As with Stealing
        From Plain Sight Spirit, the character cannot steal an
        object that is actively in use.

        with many locks can exhaust an Exalted thief who relies
        only on this Charm. Lock-Opening Touch works on all
        locks, not just those built into doors, and can be used to
        open locked shackles or chests as well.

        of Charms. With this Charm, an Exalted can
        simply step through a locked portal, closed gate, dropped
        portcullis or other closed portal. The character places her
        hand against the portal, steps forward and appears on the
        other side. This Charm also works on windows, sewer
        grates and other aperture closures, but it does not allow
        the character to pass through walls or stick his hand into
        a locked chest and fish around.

            None can challenge the ability of the Night Caste to
            walk among criminals, leam their methods and infiltrate
            their ranks. Likewise, when members of the Night Caste
            become corrupted, none can excel their ability as natural
            rulers of the underworld. It is said by many that, during the
            First Age, some among the Night Caste led organized
            criminal groups, which helped govern lawless areas and
            protect the vast cities of that era. It is unknown if this is
            true or simply history garbled by the propaganda of the
            Immaculates, however.&lt;br&gt;
            Through the use of this Charm, the Exalt can add 1
            die per mote of Essence spent to any activities relating to
            navigating. the criminal underworld, planning crimes,
            recruiting criminal underlings or comprehending the
            criminal mindset. The character cannot more than double

            aid in technical larceny such as picking locks and pockets
            or actually executing con games and espionage rings. It
            simply allows the character preternatural skill as a crime
            boss or a scourge of crime.

            Sometimes, locking a door is as valuable as opening
            one. With a single touch, the character can lock any
            door. Regardless of whether the door previously had a
            lock or not, it is impossible to open for a number of hours
            equal to the character's permanent Essence. A key that
            would ordinarily open the door will not work until after
            the scene is over. The only way to open the door in the
            meantime is to break it down. Doors that do not possess
            locks can be pushed open normally once this Charm
            ends, but lockable doors remain normally locked after
            the Charm ends.

        This Charm does not involve hiding so much as
        becoming difficult to notice. So long as the character does
        nothing to stand out, make herself obvious or become the
        center of attention, those who are not actively looking for
        someone will simply discount her as part of the scenery. For
        example, this Charm does not work on alerted guards or
        those watching over restricted areas or on those who
        intend to stop everyone who passes. Likewise, it cannot
        conceal a character who is very different from her sur-
        roundings; a tall, short-haired, light-skinned woman in a
        crowd of short, long-haired, dark-skinned men is going to
        stand out too much to benefit from this Charm.

        The ultimate mental misdirection - the character can
        vanish from all memory. She is no more or less easy to detect
        than before, but those who see her will not recognize her
        because they have no idea who she is. Essentially, the character
        sets up a separate history for herself, starting when the Charm
        is first invoked and ending when she allows it to expire. Beings
        with Essence ratings higher than the character's are immune to
        this effect. Obviously, a character trying to get somewhere she
        shouldn't should have some other Stealth abilities at work
        since, while she will not be recognized, guards are still going to
        stop someone they don't know. Extended use of this Charm can
        cause serious problems for an Exalted who is a ruler, merchant
        or other important person, as others will quickly start dividing
        up the character's now-ownerless property.

        This Charm allows the Exalted to truly disappear — no
        amount of visual searching, however thorough, will detect him,
        so long as he remains still. Moving, even in a slow, shuffling walk,
        is enough to disturb the effect of this Charm, as is any sort of
        offensive action. Characters using Invisible Statue Spirit are not
        immaterial, they can be detected by touch or by scent or hearing.

        This Charm conceals the Exalted, blurring her form
        and allowing her to blend into whatever background she
        stands against, vastly improving her Stealth. Players whose
        characters attempt to spot her when she is hiding or
        moving slowly must gain a number of additional successes
        on their Perception + Alertness rolls equal to the character's
        Essence. If she attacks from a distance, players of those who
        see the attack get one free Perception + Alertness roll at
        difficulty 1 to spot her for each attack she makes. If she
        attacks in hand-to-hand combat, all watching are assumed
        to immediately spot her.&lt;br&gt;
        Once spotted, her enemies can pick her out again at will
        until she escapes from their line of sight for at least several
        seconds. While the Exalted has Blurred Form Style active,
        enemies attacking her at range do so at a difficulty penalty equal
        to her Essence score, and those attacking her in hand-to-hand
        combat suffer a flat + 1 penalty to the difficulty of their attacks.

        Visual detection is not the only thing an Exalted must
        fear. Through the use of this Charm, an Exalted can
        protect himself from other forms of detection, as well.
        While this Charm is active, the character makes no noise
        of any sort, nor does anything carried on his person or in
        his hands. This effect does not extend beyond his touch —
        a dropped knife will still clatter, a knocked-over pot will
        still shatter. Also, while this Charm is in effect, the
        character has (and leaves) no scent of any sort. Tracking
        beasts will not detect him or be able to follow him.

            This Charm allows the character to literally vanish
            from sight. She can become completely invisible. The
            only limit to this Charm is the fact that the character must
            move slowly and carefully (move no more than six yards
            per turn) and cannot engage in any form of combat or
            perform any other activity that involves rapid movement.
            Any such movements instantly disrupt the Charm and
            render the character visible. However, the character can
            walk slowly down a corridor, pour a dram of poison in
            someone's cup or steal a treaty from a table. Characters
            using Unseen Ghost Walk are not immaterial. They can
            be detected normally by touch, scent or hearing.&lt;br&gt;
            Enemies players may attempt a reflexive Perception
            + Awareness roll each turn for the enemies to spot the
            character. If the observer saw the character disappear,
            noticed the character last turn or witnessed an action
            performed by the character, the difficulty for the check is
            only 1. However, the difficulty increases by one every turn
            that the character remains undetected; to a maximum of
            5. If the observer has some reason to believe that someone
            is around (a knocked over vase, footprints in the sand),
            the difficulty for spotting the character starts at 3 and
            scales up. Just looking casually for the invisible Exalted
            has a difficulty of 5. Even when spotted, any actions taken
            against the character are at a +2 difficulty.

        This Charm allows an Exalted to evaluate the quality
        of goods offered for sale. The character has an intuitive
        sense of if the goods are shoddy, exceptional, average or
        whatever. Note that this doesn't give the character market
        knowledge he doesn't have. If a character has no idea how
        much a good is supposed to cost, use of this power still
        won't tell him if he's being overcharged. Likewise, this
        power grants no actual knowledge of the good under
        examination, only knowledge of its quality. Presented
        with a totally unfamiliar object, the character will be able
        to tell if it is shoddy or broken but will still not know
        anything about its purpose or operation. This Charm
        works on found objects as well as those offered for sale and
        can, for example, tell if a piece of First Age magic is still
        functional or not simply by handling it.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character gains an
        intuitive feel for a marketplace at a given instant, allowing
        her to intuit roughly how much a given object will fetch in
        any one market. Though the character need not be physically
        present in the market, this Charm must be used with
        a particular sales venue in mind. A character cannot discover
        previously unknown markets through the use of this
        Charm. She can, however, review markets she is familiar
        with, even distant ones, to determine which would be the
        best place to sell a given good. The more specific the venue
        contemplated, the more accurate the forecast.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is perfectly accurate if used at the moment
        of sale. However, the more time that elapses between
        the use of the Charm and the actual sale of the goods, the
        greater the chance of an error in the character's projection.

        tell if a given potential buyer has no real intention of
        purchasing, if she's already decided to buy or if she requires
        swaying. The Exalted also has a good idea of the target's
        budget for the purchase, at least in relation to the price the
        Exalted desires to obtain. Finally, the character will know
        if the target plans to attempt to swindle or betray him in
        some fashion, making it an essential tool for characters
        dealing in illegal or extremely valuable goods.

        A character utilizing this Charm becomes the ultimate
        high-pressure salesman, able to sell practically
        anything to anyone for outrageous prices. If the target's
        Willpower is equal to or lower than the Exalted's Essence,
        he can be sold literally anything at any price — the Exalted
        may cause him to sell himself into slavery for a handful of
        potsherds or a kiss. If the target's Willpower is less than
        twice the Exalted's Essence, the Exalted's player must
        make a Wits + Bureaucracy roll. The number of successes
        is how many times the object's normal price the character
        manages to extract from the target. This Charm does not
        work on characters whose Willpower is greater than twice
        the Exalted's Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        Note that this Charm does not actually enforce the
        deal in any way, and that it works only for a single scene.
        Afterward, the target will be acutely aware of having just
        been swindled — the greater the swindle, the more likely
        he is to seek redress.

        An Exalted who uses this Charm becomes preternaturally
        adept at navigating through bureaucracies. The
        character can naturally sense who to talk to in order to
        produce results, who expects or is amenable to bribes, which
        functionaries are actually useful or friendly and which are
        simply petty individuals enjoying their tiny sliver of power.
        A player whose character uses this Charm may add the
        character's Essence score in automatic successes to any
        Bureaucracy rolls when attempting to achieve a given result
        in a bureaucracy (for example, obtain a license, passport,
        grant or audience). Note that this Charm does not make the
        impossible possible or allow an impoverished character to
        pay bribes she cannot afford, but it may allow the character
        to find away around such obstacles.

        Through the use of this Charm, a character can cause
        a bureaucracy to accomplish a task in record time. An
        Exalted using Speed the Wheels causes the bureaucracy to
        work (her Essence + 1) times faster for the duration of a
        particular job. For example, a character with Essence 3 who
        uses the Speed the Wheels Charm to expedite an appeal to
        the ruler of a city to use the naval dry-docks to repair her ship
        would be able to make the appropriate appointments and
        cause the proper papers to be read four times faster than
        normal. Note that this Charm simply speeds the process, it
        does not increase the character's chances of success. Characters
        who wish to improve their chances of success should
        use Social Charms or Deft Official's Way.

        An Exalted who knows this Charm may use it to aid in
        an investigation of corruption in a bureaucracy. In order for
        this Charm to work, the character must either request or
        take part in the investigation. The result will be an actual
        investigation — there will be genuine inquiries, real punishments
        and, potentially, even meaningful reform. If this
        Charm is used by an Exalted who is heading an investigation,
        it causes questioned individuals to be much more
        cooperative than they would be otherwise, and subordinates
        who would otherwise go through the motions of their jobs
        will instead actually attempt to ferret out the corruption.&lt;br&gt;
        Note that there is a finite upper limit on the how wide-ranging
        an investigation this Charm can support. If the
        character is reforming an entire bureaucracy, the Storyteller
        should feel free to force him to commit Essence to this
        Charm more than once. Typically, an Exalted can bolster
        the efforts of (her Essence rating × 20) individuals per use of
        this Charm. This Charm does not cause an investigation to
        be launched, merely reinforces one that is already in progress.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Solar Exalted can use their powers to slow as well as
        hasten the actions of a bureaucracy. Through the use of the
        Indolent Official Charm, a character may bring the wheels
        of government to a screeching, grinding halt with regard to
        a single task. Papers will be lost at every turn, every petty
        official who could possibly interfere or request a bribe will do
        so, and petitions and requests will inevitably end up neglected
        at the bottom of the pile. For every point of Essence
        the character possesses, the amount of time the bureaucracy
        needs to accomplish a given task is multiplied by one.&lt;br&gt;
        The character need not be part of the matter to be
        delayed, but must know about the situation well enough to
        specify it. Characters may invest Essence speculatively (for
        example, &amp;quot;the ongoing secret police investigation into my
        affair&amp;quot; is a perfectly valid target, even if the character isn't
        sure one exists) but will not know if the Charm had an
        effect or not — as long as she keeps the Essence committed,
        an investigation that meets her criteria will be hampered.
        As with Bureau-Rectifying Method, there is an upper limit
        to the size of the delay that the character can impose. Each
        use of this Charm can hinder the efforts of a number of
        investigators equal to (the character's Essence * 20).

        The character can cause a request, project or initiative
        to become the kiss of death for a bureaucracy. Meetings
        produce nothing, initiatives fall into pointless squabbling,
        and departmental infighting hampers even the simplest
        matters. Worse, the fighting spreads, rippling out from the
        issue in question to other matters and, eventually, hamper-
        ing or even crippling the bureaus involved. When
        bureaucracies are subject to the Foul Air of Argument
        Technique, they operate at a fraction of their efficiency
        equal to 1/(1 + the Essence score of the character), so a
        character with Essence 1 would make a bureau work at 1/2
        efficiency, one with Essence 2 would make it work at 1/3,
        Essence 3 at 1/4, and so on. A character cannot use multiple
        invocations of this Charm on the same bureau at once.&lt;br&gt;

            it until the Exalted ceases committing Essence to the
            Charm or chooses to retrieve the item herself. The
            item may be virtually anything that can be moved
            through human effort: a letter, an artifact, a piece of
            jewelry — even a statue or the like. It is shuffled from
            place to place, stored and forgotten, and it draws no
            attention to itself. Investigation attempts to find the
            concealed item have their difficulty increased by the
            Exalted's Essence.

            Forgetful Bureau Charm allows an Exalted character
            to erase all evidence of one item or individual
            from a particular bureaucracy. Records are lost or
            destroyed, officials misremember facts, and so forth.
            The effects take some time to make themselves felt.
            A small local bureaucracy is affected within a day.
            Larger organizations may take weeks, or even months,
            before the process is complete. So far as the bureaucracy
            is concerned, the item or individual in question
            does not exist. Those with direct contact with the
            subject still recall it normally, but official records
            and other documentation do not support their recollections.
            New records can come into being after this
            Charm is used, but previous records on the subject
            are permanently lost.&lt;br&gt;
            This Charm allows the Chosen to create difficulties
            for others by eliminating all official record of
            them or for the Exalted to protect their own secrets,
            such as removing evidence of a Circle's activities or of
            the location of a particular Demesne or Manse.

        Through the use of this Charm, a character can write
        or copy with superhuman speed. While this does not allow
        the character to write creative works much faster than
        normal (since the physical act of writing rarely slows a
        creator), she can write quickly enough to copy even a large
        book in a single day or make an accurate transcript of a rapid
        conversation containing multiple parties. While the
        character's writing doesn't destroy pens from writing too
        fast, they do wear down at the regular speed, and the
        character's writing consumes the regular amount of ink. The
        product of this Charm is a copy of the work in question, not
        a perfect facsimile. It's written in the character's own hand,
        contains as many errors as if the character had done it at
        normal speed without the use of a Charm and is otherwise
        an imperfect rendering of the original.

        Sometimes a character needs more than a copy of a
        document; sometimes he needs a perfect facsimile. Flawless
        Brush Discipline allows a character to produce just
        that. The character copies at her regular writing speed, but
        the result is not a copy, but a perfect replica of the original
        document, indistinguishable from the original. A character
        without colored inks trying to copy illuminated text
        will produce a carefully shaded monotone replica of the
        original. Flawless Brush Discipline copies only text and
        illustrations — it does not allow the character to forge seals
        or impressions affixed to a document.

        By carefully injecting allusions, subtle stresses and
        loaded word choices, the character can imbed a secret
        message in a document of seemingly innocuous character
        - a shopping list, a bill of lading or even a quickly dashed
        note. The intended recipient (who must be very familiar to
        the Exalted using this Charm) is the only one who will be
        able to comprehend the message, though an Exalted using
        the Sagacious Reading of Intent Charm will be able to
        detect the Letter-Within-a-Letter Technique's use. The
        hidden message can be no longer (in words) than one-half
        the length of the &amp;quot;cover&amp;quot; document.

        The character can make out the minute traces of
        writing that was once readable but has now been damaged
        or erased. Examples are palimpsests, water-soluble inks
        that have been left in the rain and stone inscriptions that
        have been rendered unreadable by purposeful vandalism or
        the action of the elements. Writing of which effectively no
        traces remain - writing on paper that was burnt to ash of
        on stone that has been smashed to gravel — cannot be
        recovered with this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Discerning Savant's Eye does not give the character
        the ability to understand a language she cannot normally
        read, though she may use Flawless Brush Discipline to
        make a perfect copy of the material as it originally appeared
        for later translation.

        This Charm allows a character reading a letter, book or
        other form of written text to understand the author's biases,
        opinions and hidden agendas. Characters using this Charm
        when reading a book will immediately discer if and in what
        direction the material is slanted. Note that this works even if the
        author is unaware of her own biases. In addition to the obvious
        uses, this Charm is very useful for detecting literary forgeries.

        Exalted with this Charm can convey ideas and concepts
        through pantomime. The character's gestures carry far
        more meaning than any normal mortal's. While there is
        little room for subtlety or poetry, the character can communicate
        even complex concepts across the language barrier.
        For example, a character could convey, &amp;quot;He offended my
        honor, and I pursue him to seek redress in an honorable duel.
        Surrender him to me or face my wrath.&amp;quot; However, a character
        is unlikely to succeed in acquiring a lover, unless &amp;quot;I am
        attracted to you and desire a sexual encounter&amp;quot; is all the
        wooing the potential partner requires.

        Twisted Words Technique allows one of the Exalted to
        weight certain words or meanings in a speech or written work
        in order to sway the listener or reader to a particular way of
        thinking. Characters with a permanent Willpower lower
        than the character's Essence score who read or listen to the
        Exalted's words will come to agree with the idea she presents.
        Players whose characters possess a Willpower less than twice
        the Exalted's Essence must make a Willpower roll or have
        their characters swayed into a favorable view of the matter.
        Note that the concealed message must be germane to the
        topic at hand, but the character can seem to advocate an idea
        on the surface while the subtext is negative, or vice versa.

        A character using this Charm can speak in such a magnetic
        and engaging fashion that listeners simply cannot do anything
        else but pay attention to what he's saying. When he activates this
        Charm, the Exalted's player makes a Manipulation + Linguistics
        roll. Thereafter, players of characters with an Essence less than
        the Exalted's who hear the Chosen speak must make a reflexive
        Willpower roll with a difficulty equal to the number of successes
        made on the Linguistics roll. Those who fail are entranced by the
        character's voice and are held enraptured until the character
        ceases speaking for more than a few seconds.&lt;br&gt;
        It is not necessary to speak the Exalted's language to
        succumb to this power. Attack or other obvious open hostility
        causes the effect of this Charm to end. However, only direct
        physical danger will disrupt the effect. A brave or suicidal Exalted
        could, for example, use Unbreakable Fascination Method to
        keep a platoon of guards in a burning building with him until it
        was fully aflame, but they would not stand there listening as the
        flaming timbers started crashing down around them.

            A character using this Charm can completely
            memorize a written work or illustration in the time it
            takes to read or study it. The character can also
            memorize spoken words. A work can generally be no
            longer than a medium-sized book, a few hours of
            conversation or a single fairly complex illustration,
            such as a map. Longer works require correspondingly
            greater amounts of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
            The character's memory of the work is flawless:
            He can recite it from beginning to end, copy it down
            entirely from memory and even use his recollection in
            conjunction with Charms such as Whirling Brush
            Method and Flawless Brush Discipline to produce
            copies of the work. He can navigate from a memorized
            map as if he had it in front of him at all times.
            Although the Chosen can use this Charm to memorize
            a lexicon of a foreign language (thereby memorizing
            its vocabulary and grammar), his use of that language
            is somewhat halting and crude, since he still needs to
            &amp;quot;look up&amp;quot; and translate meanings in his head.&lt;br&gt;
            The work remains memorized for as long as the
            Chosen commits Essence to it. When the Essence is
            no longer committed, the character's memory of the
            work fades to what it would normally be if the character
            had simply read, viewed or listened to the work

            With this Charm, the Solar Exalted may acquire
            the ability to speak and understand a language merely
            by hearing it spoken. The Charm requires at least an
            hour of exposure to the language. So long as the
            Essence is committed, the Chosen is completely fluent
            in that language, without a trace of accent, but
            cannot read or write in it A character can master a
            total number of languages equal to her dots in Linguistics
            by using this Charm. Once the Essence is no
            longer committed, the knowledge of the language
            fades immediately.

            character can produce a flawless forgery of any written
            work or illustration, provided he has a sample to work
            from — at least one written sentence or a single
            illustration. The forgery need not be a duplicate of the
            sample, but it perfectly replicates the original's style,
            such that anyone familiar with that style would instantly
            recognize it. The character works at his normal
            writing or drawing speed but produces work in the
            chosen style. A character using Sagacious Reading of
            Intent who is familiar with the original style can
            determine that the forgery is not genuine, but otherwise,
            it is completely flawless and undetectable.

            The ability to effectively convey information is
            an important part of teaching. This Charm aids the
            Exalted in passing on their wisdom. A character writes
            a treatise or manual with any Attribute or any Ability,
            Charm or spell known to the Exalt as its subject.
            Creating the text requires time equal to that needed to
            train for the author's rating in the chosen Trait (Exalted,
            p. 271). For example, a character with Socialize
            5 writing a manual on proper etiquette and social
            behavior would take four weeks. If a Charisma 5
            character wrote a manual on making friends and
            influencing people, it would take four months. Charms
            such as Whirling Brush Method cannot reduce this
            time, since writing the manual requires careful and
            deliberate thought.&lt;br&gt;
            Once the text is prepared, others reading it may
            spend experience to acquire that Trait, using only
            the text as their tutor. The reader must be capable of
            learning the Trait described by the text and can only
            acquire or improve the Trait to the rating of the
            text's author. So, a manual that describes Martial
            Arts 3 is useless for a character with a Martial Arts
            rating of 3 or better, since he has already exceeded
            the manual's knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
            Unfortunately, the vast majority of the various
            manuals and treatises penned by the Solar Exalted of
            the First Age were lost or destroyed, although some
            are said to be preserved in ancient Manses or perhaps
            in the libraries of certain Dynasts or Sidereals.

        With but a glance, the character can evaluate the age,
        health and temperament of a mount or draft animal. The

        Through the use of this Charm, the character silently
        summons her mount, which will move toward her at the best
        possible speed. This Charm has a range of (10 x the character's
        Essence) miles. The character must have built up a relationship
        with the summoned animal — typically riding and
        caring for it for several days — before it will respond to this
        Charm. While the character's steed will always respond to
        this call and will not become distracted or lost, it's still an
        animal. It can't get through locked doors or penetrate
        complex obstacles any better than it normally could.

        Horses' instincts are to run away from what they perceive as
        danger — the smells of fire and blood or the sounds of conflict and
        wounded animals. This often puts them at odds with adventurous
        riders, who are probably trying to reach and linger near the stimuli.
        Through the use of this Charm, a character can render her mount
        immune to terror for the rest of the scene, thus obviating the need
        for rolls to control the animal around frightening sensations.

        While their speed in battle is tremendously greater than
        that of a man on foot, traveling long distances with mounts is
        often slower than walking. Mounts must be rested during the
        march and must be cared for before and after the day's travel.
        Through the use of this Charm, the character can reduce the
        need to care for animals during travel. Mounts under the effect
        of this Charm are very resistant to problems such as thrown
        shoes and injured hooves and legs. They can also keep up a brisk
        walk for an entire day without resting, even when burdened
        with armored riders or cargo panniers. Keep in mind that, unless
        this Charm is used on the characters' remounts or their pack
        animals, the characters' overall marching speed will still be
        limited by the speed of the slowest beast in the group.

        A sick or injured mount is a serious problem for its rider.
        Even outside of a battle, the loss of an animal can be a tremendous
        expense. By the use of this Charm, the character heals a number
        of his mount's health levels equal to his Essence rating. If the
        mount is unwounded, then this Charm cures any diseases or
        parasites the beast possesses. This Charm does not take effect
        instantly - the character must spend a scene tending to the
        mount by dressing its wounds, feeding it, currying or otherwise
        grooming it — for the healing effects to set in.

            leaves no tracks, even in snow or soft sand, and can
            run across any surface - even mud, quicksand or
            water — at its normal speed without sinking. Note
            that the mount's hooves do still touch the surface, so
            a mount cannot run across dangerous liquids such as
            molten lava or acid without harm. The Chosen must
            spend Essence for each turn the mount passes over the
            surface, or it will sink, meaning this Charm is only
            useful for crossing short distances.

            the Exalt bridge gaps such as canyons and chasms,
            allowing horse and rider to cross. The mount moves at
            its normal speed, and the Exalted must spend Essence
            each turn of the crossing, or gravity takes hold once
            again, usually with regrettable results.

            simply moves at a greater rate of speed during that

        By feeling the Essence flows in the world around
        him, the character can sense the depth of the water for
        (100 x his Essence rating) yards. This knowledge allows
        him to discern harbor channels, sense reefs and so on.
        Note that awareness of a hazard doesn't necessarily mean
        that the character's ship is agile or well-handled enough
        to avoid the obstacle.

        A character using this Charm while aboard a ship can
        tack much more closely to the wind than would be normal
        for his ship and rigging. Ships affected by this Charm
        cannot sail directly into the wind, but they can sail very
        near to it and, in general, handle more lightly and responsively
        than normal. Aside from additions to maneuverability
        and speed, which vary from ship to ship, the pilot may add
        the Essence rating of the character invoking the Charm to
        her Dexterity + Sail for ship handling. A ship that has had
        multiple Exalted use this Charm on it only benefits from
        the character with the highest Essence score.

        Storms are great banes of ships, particularly the lightly
        built galleys that ferry cargo between the ports of the Inner
        Sea. Storms can snap masts and oars, capsize ships or simply
        smash them beneath vast swells. While under the protection
        of this Charm, a ship is safe from these and other weather-related
        disasters, so long as it has a competent helmsman —
        no Charm can protect a ship drifting without steerage in a
        gale. A character with this Charm can protect a ship of up to
        (20 x the character's Essence rating) feet in length.

        Even more dangerous to a boat than a storm is a sharp
        impact — from the ram of a warship or from a rock or shoal.
        Even running aground on a sandbank can gut a ship or
        damage it so severely it founders. By bracing herself against
        the ship and channeling Essence through it at the moment
        of impact, the character can cause her magic to absorb the
        damage, leaving the ship unharmed. This effect can cause
        severe damage to a ramming vessel, as the preserved ship
        yields only as much as the impact of the ram pushes it
        sideways through the water. The character may have to use
        this Charm multiple turns in a row if the ship suffers
        multiple impacts. For example, if the ship fails to turn away
        and scrapes longways across a reef, the character may have
        to renew the Charm every turn the scraping continues. As
        with Storm-Weathering Essence Infusion, a character
        cannot use this Charm to protect a ship of more than (20
        x the character's Essence rating) feet in length.

            can uncover where the nearest safe harbor or beaching site
            is located and how to get there. Although the approach to
            the harbor will be clear of hazards and the beach there
            usable for small craft (even if the vessel itself cannot
            beach), the harbor will not necessarily be safe for the crew.
            There might well be monsters in the bay or surroundings,
            the nearby natives (if any) may be unfriendly, or other
            hidden dangers may exist.

            Fire is rightly feared on all sea-going vessels. Even a ship
            with a First Age hull is filled with furnishings and supplies
            that will burn — and the crew has nowhere to go. Even small
            fires are tolerated only because of necessity, and the galley
            on a ship is the most carefully designed part of most vessels.
            This Charm renders a vessel completely immune to the
            ravages of fire altogether; while it is in effect, no natural fire
            can start aboard the ship. Although existing fires will not be
            affected, neither will they spread further, confining themselves
            to destroying what they are actually burning at that
            moment; any fuel added to the fire will simply refuse to burn.
            Magical or elemental fires can be set normally, but they will
            burn for half as long and take half the effort to douse than
            usual. While burning, they will inflict whatever damage
            they normally would, however.

            only tack deeper into the wind than any mortal helmsman,
            she may ignore its direction completely. So long as the

            in its sails, no matter what direction the winds actually blow
            or what course the helmsman sets. Anyone watching the
            Exalted's vessel while it sails in defiance of the winds will
            obviously know that some sort of powerful magic is in use.

            this Charm, the Exalt can render the mast of a ship he is on
            immune to even the greatest winds or the strongest attacks.
            Only actions taken by Deathlords, extremely powerful
            elementals or spirits and the most powerful Exalted (those
            with a permanent Essence of 6 or greater) can hope to
            destroy a ship's mast while this Charm is in effect.

            motes of Essence she spends, the hull gains lethal soak equal
            to the Exalted's permanent Essence. This Charm can be
            applied multiple times to the same vessel in a scene, but
            under no circumstances can the soak gained through the use
            of this Charm exceed the highest Stamina + Sail total of any
            Exalt who used this Charm on the ship during the scene.

            The character using this Charm weaves sails out
            of pure Essence for a ship that has no sails (or badly
            damaged ones). The new sails are of a shimmering
            golden cloth, as light as silk but stronger than canvas.
            They appear on the ship's masts and furl or unfurl at
            their creator's command. They may bear an emblem of
            the Chosen's anima, if she wishes it. Golden Essence
            Sails have a soak value of (the Exalt's permanent
            Essence score + 2) for resisting attacks against the
            ship's rigging or sails, and they do not accumulate
            damage (they ignore any attack insufficient to damage
            them, just like the ship itself does). See Savage Seas,

        Use of this Charm allows a character to instantly read
        the superficial subtext of a social situation. The surface
        attitudes (&amp;quot;she is angry at him&amp;quot;) and relationships (&amp;quot;she
        respects him a great deal, perhaps he is her father or like a
        father&amp;quot;) of the individuals involved are apparent at a mere
        glance. Characters who are skilled at concealing their
        motives will project the exterior emotions they are pretending.
        It's up to the Storyteller's discretion as to how
        skilled a character must be to appear to feel other than they
        really do - Socialize or Performance 2 and a serious effort
        should suffice. This Charm is not a form of mind reading,
        nor does it offer precise results — it simply allows the
        Exalted get his bearings when faced with confusing or
        unfamiliar social situations.

        This Charm allows an Exalted to tell, through a short,
        topical interaction, what the target's true motives in a situation
        are. For example, an Exalted who talked to a woman
        about her sick father would be able to tell if she was at his
        bedside out of love, filial loyalty or greed for her inheritance.
        Where there are mixed motives, the Exalted will gain a rough
        feel of in what proportions they occur. This power is especially
        useful for Exalted leaders, as it lets them keep their entourages
        free of the self-serving and the corrupt.

        will reflexively respond in the appropriate and mannerly

        deep, covering only simple things such as greetings, eating
        customs, gift customs and flirtation moves. The character
        will never make an unintentional faux pas but is not
        charismatic so much as simply well behaved. Too much

        or any number of things — but there is invariably
        something that, when offered, will crack the strongest
        morals and ethics. To have it, an individual will betray
        trusts, engage in corruption, plant evidence - almost
        anything. This Charm allows the character to know what
        that thing is for a given individual. It is up to the Storyteller
        to define precisely what a given person's weakness is — the
        things some people require may be difficult or impossible
        to obtain, while other characters may simply need to be
        offered a large sum of money. Generally, the higher a
        character's Temperance score, the more likely her price
        will be something other than money and the more likely it
        will be difficult to arrange.

        Cost: 20 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Socialize: 5&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Motive-Discerning Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows an Exalted to read motives on a
        grand scale, gaining a picture of the flows and eddies of
        power in an extended social situation such as a king's court
        or a mercantile community. The character must spend a
        number of days equal to (10 - her Essence score) in
        observation of the situation. The character need not be
        part of the social milieu to observe, she need simply be
        close to it; a character disguised as a servant or maid will be
        able to observe adequately as well. It's up to the Storyteller
        to decide how the information is conveyed. Some Storytellers
        will want to draw a diagram, while others may
        simply explain who says &amp;quot;jump!&amp;quot; and who asks &amp;quot;how high?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
        The character's understanding is limited by what she
        has witnessed - for example, if an important figure is
        absent during her period of observation, she may be able to
        deduce a great deal from how people act in his absence but
        will not know for certain until she can reconstruct her
        picture once he has returned. Also, the character's preternatural
        understanding is rooted in the time it was made.
        Unless the mapped situation is extremely stagnant, events
        will cause the pattern of interactions to change over time.
        Characters relying on years-old understanding are liable to
        make errors in judgment.

        Through the use of this Charm, an Exalted can turn her
        target into a social outcast. The target's words seem false,
        tentative or devious, by turns, and even his friends notice the
        worst parts of his personality — and all of it is true. This Charm
        is not an illusion. It simply brings the worst parts of the target
        to the fore. The Exalted must touch her target to use this
        Charm. For a full day afterward, the target takes a penalty on all
        social rolls equal to twice the Exalted's Essence score.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;

            A character using this Charm becomes more socially
            attractive: People find her words charming, her
            appearance and manner intriguing and her overall
            presence pleasant and enjoyable. The Chosen's player
            gains automatic successes equal to his character's
            permanent Essence on Socialize rolls to make new
            acquaintances, gain introductions and so forth.

            While this Charm is in use, any effort to spy on
            the Exalt has its difficulty increased by the character's
            permanent Essence score. Background noise is always
            just loud enough to cover the character's conversations,
            inopportune interruptions prevent others from
            listening in or looking over the character's shoulder,
            and searchers never find anything incriminating in
            the character's quarters or possessions. The Charm
            does not guard against open inquiries or observation:
            The character can still be interrogated or openly
            watched; it only makes it difficult to monitor the
            Chosen covertly.

            &lt;br&gt;
            By attuning with the flow of Essence, the Chosen
            becomes virtually unflappable. No matter how difficult
            or unusual the social situation, she navigates it
            with enviable ease and grace. Every 2 motes of Essence
            spent allow the Exalt's player to ignore one point of
            difficulty on all Socialize rolls imposed by conditions
            such as a foreign environment, interpersonal tensions,
            bad weather and bad food, even insult or injury.
            The difficulty of any Socialize roll cannot be reduced
            below 1, and this Charm only overcomes penalties
            that increase the difficulty, it does not make normally
            difficult feats of Socialize easier (such as convincing a
            hated enemy to be cooperative). The Exalt using this
            Charm appears graceful and dignified under even the
            worst circumstances.

            The Chosen's mastery of social graces can remove
            him from danger in more ways than one.
            Through a combination of reading an opponent's
            body language and the use of witty or engaging
            banter, the character may add a number of dice equal
            to his Socialize Ability to a single dodge attempt in
            combat. The character's opponent must be capable
            of hearing and understanding the Exalt's words, so
            this Charm is ineffective against opponents who are
            deaf, do not speak the same language or are largely
            mindless (such as zombies or beasts).

            The Exalted engages in an almost nonstop stream
            of witty banter with her opponents, intended to distract
            them and keep them off balance. So long as the
            character keeps up the dialog, opponents attacking
            her subtract a number of dice from their pools equal to
            the Exalt's Essence. This Charm only works on opponents
            capable of hearing and understanding the
            character's words and whose Essence is lower than the
            character's. The Charm ends if the Chosen stops
            talking for more than a turn.

            This Charm allows the Exalt to conceal his true
            feelings and motivations; a character using this Charm
            can speak pleasantly to a hated enemy without any
            hint of his true feelings showing through. Add the
            Chosen's permanent Essence score to the difficulty of
            rolls to pick up on the Exalt's true feelings and motivations.
            Charms that automatically do so (such as
            Motive-Discerning Technique) require a successful
            reflexive opposed Perception + Socialize roll against
            the Exalt's Wits + Socialize to succeed while this
            Charm is in effect.

            With a masterful understanding of human (and
            inhuman) nature, the Exalt using this Charm can
            learn a subject's Nature simply by engaging him in
            a brief conversation. This provides the Chosen
            with information about the subject's motivations
            on a broad scale, rather than relating to a specific
            situation (such as that gained from Motive-Discerning
            Technique). While the Exalted gains a
            rough idea of what motivates the subject, she does
            not necessarily know how the subject will react in
            any given situation.

            someone else's achievements and good qualities, improving
            her reputation and standing within a particular
            social circle. The subject's virtues are emphasized and
            talked about, while others tend to turn a blind eye to
            the subject's faults. The Exalted must touch the subject
            to use this Charm and must offer some praise for
            the subject in a public setting. For a full day afterward,
            the subject's player gains a bonus on all Social rolls
            equal to the Exalted's Essence score. This Charm has
            no effect on characters with a higher Essence than the
            Exalt activating the Charm.
