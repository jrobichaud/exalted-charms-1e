        Dark Steed Mastery&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per die&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Conviction: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is frequently taught to ghostly cavalry in
        the service of a Deathlord or another tyrant of the Underworld.
        Dark Steed Mastery allows a ghost to better control
        a ghostly mount. This Arcanos adds one die to the ghost’s
        Ride dice pools for every mote of Essence spent, to a
        maximum number of dice equal to his Essence. This
        Charm can only be used within the Underworld or a
        shadowland, unless the ghost uses Manifest the Dark Steed
        (see p. 41).

        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;

        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a ghost sailor to better fulfill his
        duties. The ghost who uses Pole the Black Depths gains
        one die to his Sail dice pools for every mote of Essence
        spent, to a maximum number of dice equal to his Essence.
        This Charm can only be used within the Underworld or a
        shadowland, unless the ghost is on the crew of a boat
        manifested through the use of Conjure the Defeated Vessel
        or Sunken Admiral Technique (see p. 41-42).

        Scent of Sweet Blood&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This simple Charm allows a ghost to smell spilled
        blood or bleeding wounds at a range of one mile per dot of
        Essence. The blood does not have to be particularly fresh,
        but it should be from a mortal or Exalt — animal blood is
        only sensed at half the range that mortal or Exalt blood can
        be smelled. The ghost learns the direction of and distance
        to the blood. Unusually large amounts — say, more than
        a human body’s worth — may be detected at as far away as
        five miles per dot of Essence, and strong wind currents or
        other intense weather may interfere with this ability.

        Moon's Cold Glow&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 2 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One night per success&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Conviction: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Underworld is gloomy and dark even on its
        brightest mornings. This simple art allows a ghost to pierce
        the natural darkness of the Underworld. If there is no
        precipitation or fog, double the distance for both Clear
        Vision and Murky Vision for the ghost, to a maximum of
        100 yards (see Exalted, p. 237). Roll Perception + Conviction.
        Success means that the ghost can see normally until
        the following dawn, and each additional success adds 24
        hours to the duration from that point.
        &quot;

    whispers_of_the_living[Whispers of the Living]
    click whispers_of_the_living callback &quot;
        Whispers of the Living&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 3 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One minute per success&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Conviction: 2&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Underworld is itself a dark reflection of Creation,
        and every point in the Underworld corresponds to a
        particular space in Creation. This Arcanos allows the
        ghost to hear the living world as though she was standing
        in the equivalent spot to her current location in the
        Underworld. A Perception + Occult roll activates the
        Charm, and the ghost can listen for one minute per
        success. A botch on this roll allows any living being in that
        same location to hear unearthly whispers and winds,
        giving away these strange goings-on. Whispers of the
        Living only works at night. As with Two World Vision,
        Whispers of the Living does not allow a ghost to listen in
        from Creation into the Underworld.

    click pyre_smoke_form callback &quot;
        Pyre Smoke Form&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 2 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One turn per success&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Temperance: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        With Pyre Smoke Form, a ghost may become incorporeal
        even in environments where he would ordinarily be
        manifest — in the Underworld, for instance, or in a
        shadowland during Calibration. Using this Arcanos requires
        a Stamina + Temperance roll, and each success
        allows one turn of incorporeality.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One turn per success&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Conviction: 2&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Pyre Smoke Form&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Breeze-Carried Ash Form allows a ghost to fly through
        the air at any speed up to his maximum running pace, so
        long as he is incorporeal as he does so (this Charm is
        primarily effective only in the land of the living). His
        player must make a Dexterity + Athletics roll, and each
        success allows one turn of flight. If the ghost is above
        ground level when the Charm expires, he falls toward the
        ground as though solid. He does not take any damage from
        the fall, however, because he must be incorporeal to use
        this Arcanos.
        &quot;

    two_world_vision[Two-World Vision]
    click two_world_vision callback &quot;
        Two-World Vision&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 2 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One turn per success&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Conviction: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Every spot in the Underworld has an analog within
        Creation proper — the lands of the dead are simply a dark
        mirror to the lands above. With this Charm, a ghost can
        glance from his location in the Underworld at the corresponding
        space in Creation. A Perception + Occult roll
        suffices to activate the Charm and provides one turn of
        vision per success. Two World Vision only works at night.
        This Arcanos doesn’t work both ways. Even if the ghost
        finds himself in the living

        Assassin's Subtle Escape&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One hour per success&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Temperance: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Assassin’s Subtle Escape allows a ghost to tempo-
        rarily inhabit a mundane object in the living world. The
        ghost simply lays his hand upon the object, and his
        physical essence is absorbed into the thing. The ghost’s
        presence cannot be detected by mundane means, though
        Charms such as Superior Sight Focus (see Exalted: The
        Abyssals, p. 205) allow others to detect him. While
        inhabiting an object, the ghost cannot be directly harmed.
        Damage to the object does not harm the inhabiting
        ghost, but the item’s destruction by fire, pulverization or
        magic sends the ghost to Lethe. The ghost’s player must
        succeed in a Manipulation + Crafts roll for the ghost to
        successfully inhabit the object, and he remains within it
        for up to one hour per success or until he decides to leave
        — note that once the ghost leaves the object the Charm
        expires. The ghost may expend an additional 5 motes and
        a point of Willpower in order for his player to reroll his
        duration at any time. However, the new duration of the
        Charm is measured from the new expenditure and roll
        (rather than being tacked onto the end of the existing use
        of the Charm).&lt;br&gt;
        Assassin’s Subtle Escape does not allow a ghost resid-
        ing in an object to animate the object in any fashion. He
        is only a passenger. Only one ghost can reside in a given
        object at a time.

        Duration: One turn per success&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Valor: 3&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Assassin’s Subtle Escape&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Motivated Shell can only be activated once a ghost
        inhabits an object through Assassin’s Subtle Escape
        (above). This Arcanos enables the ghost to control the
        motions of an object he inhabits. The motions must be
        the sorts of things that the object could ordinarily do or
        be made to do by hand. A door swings open or closed; a
        lock turns or opens; a cart’s wheels roll on their own. The
        ghost’s player rolls Manipulation + Craft, and each success
        allows the ghost to control the object’s ordinary
        movements for one turn.

        Prerequisite Charms: Assassin’s Subtle Escape&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the ghost to use Assassin’s Subtle
        Escape to inhabit an object made of the Five Magical
        Materials. Ride the Mystic Vessel does not allow the ghost
        to inhabit highly enchanted items (those requiring Arti-
        fact •• or higher) unless those items are made of soulsteel
        or jade. Even then, the ghost cannot inhabit an item if it
        is Artifact •••• or above or attuned to an Exalt.
        Ghosts cannot combine Arcanoi into Combos, so
        this Arcanos cannot be activated simultaneously with
        Assassin’s Subtle Escape. Instead, the ghost must activate
        Ride the Mystic Vessel and then, the following
        turn, activate Assassin’s Subtle Escape and enter the
        object in question.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Arcanos allows an angry ghost to harness his rage
        into a storm of flying objects in Creation. This storm will
        injure any unarmored beings caught within it, and it does
        not differentiate between friend and foe. The ghost’s
        player rolls Conviction + Melee. Every success increases
        the diameter of the storm by five yards. The storm hurts
        those caught in the area. It deals four dice of lethal damage
        if the objects used are sharp and hard and four dice of
        bashing damage otherwise (with successes adding to this
        damage). An entity caught within the storm of objects can
        defend against it normally.

        This art — one of the few introduced to ghostly
        society by the Deathlords — replicates the Abyssal Exaltation
        in that it allows a ghost to hide his true name from
        Creation. The ghost hides his name behind a title or an
        obviously false name and can never speak or respond to his
        true name. In return, the character receives an additional
        three dice to resist any sorcery or necromancy that relies on
        his name or identity. It does not protect him against line-of-sight
        magical attacks, however — the character’s identity
        as “Mavis Karan” is protected, not his identity as “third guy
        from the left at that table.”

        &lt;br&gt;
        With Waxen Ghostly Flesh, a ghost can adjust his
        form. Features can be lengthened or eradicated, appearances
        changed, height and girth added or decreased, and
        skin or hair color altered. Ghosts can assume improbable
        colors and shapes through the use of this Arcanos, and
        those whose appearance has been altered through the use
        of this Charm may be iridescent, inwardly glowing or
        painted with flawless funeral makeup. The ghost using the
        Charm spends Essence and then, molding his flesh as a
        potter would mold clay, adjusts the aspects of his appearance
        that he wishes to change.&lt;br&gt;
        A Dexterity + Craft (Moliation) roll indicates the
        success level of the attempt, with the amount of change
        the ghost is attempting to render determining the difficulty.
        Note that using this power restricts the ghost to a
        roughly human form of mass roughly equivalent to the
        ghost’s own, and it does not grant useful armor, fangs or
        claws (though it can create the appearance of such). The
        ghost is simply reshaping himself, not drawing new ghostly
        matter from elsewhere.&lt;br&gt;
        After a scene, the ghost’s flesh begins to melt back
        toward its customary form. The process is visible to anyone
        observing the ghost closely (Perception + Awareness roll)
        and is a useful and time-honored method of flushing out
        ghostly impostors. A ghost thus reshaped can spend a
        Willpower point to arrest the slide back to his usual form
        for an hour, at which point the process picks up where it
        left off. This process can be repeated as long as the ghost

        &lt;br&gt;
        With Nine Terrors Visage, a ghost can instantly
        assume another face without so much as moving a muscle.
        The ghost’s image simply shifts and changes. The mask
        remains in place for an hour, at which point it melts and
        shifts back to the ghost’s original appearance. The change
        in visage can be maintained for an additional day by the
        expenditure of a Willpower point.&lt;br&gt;
        Many ghosts have a series of visages they use on a
        regular basis, ranging from the horrifying to the alluring.
        Creating a visage requires a day’s effort, a successful Dex-
        terity + Craft (Moliation) roll to plan and a Dexterity +
        Compassion (difficulty 2 for normal visages) roll to create.
        If the rolls are successful, the visage is now available for the
        ghost to use whenever she pleases.&lt;br&gt;
        Some visages may be so horrifying and/or alluring that
        they may have an additional affect beyond simply chang-
        ing the ghost’s appearance. These Visages are +2 difficulty
        on the roll to create (planning difficulty as normal). Some
        visage effects include:&lt;br&gt;
        Fear: The players of all who see the ghost’s face must
        make a successful Valor roll (difficulty 1) or have their
        characters flee in terror for the duration of a scene. They
        will not be able to fight except in self-defense, and then, all
        rolls will still be at +2 difficulty.&lt;br&gt;
        Entrancement: Those who see the ghost’s face are so
        smitten with its otherworldly beauty that their players
        must succeed on a Temperance roll (difficulty 1) or have
        their characters become enraptured with the spirit. Such
        smitten souls are prone to follow the ghost’s suggestions or
        to do whatever they think will please the ghost of their
        own initiative.&lt;br&gt;
        Disgust: The ghost’s visage is so repulsive that the
        player of any observer must succeed on a Willpower roll
        (difficulty 1), or his character is caught in the throes of a
        brief bout of nausea. Players of those thus afflicted are at +1
        difficulty on their rolls for any physical activity. This effect
        persists for the remainder of the scene, but the character
        can only suffer from it once at a given time.&lt;br&gt;
        Once a character has successfully overcome the ef-
        fects of a Nine Terrors Visage, she is immune to the ghost
        using that particular visage on her ever thereafter. How-
        ever, those mortals who fail to resist are at +1 difficulty to
        resist it the next time. Four consecutive failures means that
        the character will never be able to resist the effects of that
        visage without a dramatic change in her mental makeup.
        This limitation does not apply to the Exalted, who are too
        mighty for such ghostly tricks.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The ghost’s spirit form becomes soft and pliable upon
        impact, rendering her more resistant to damage. The
        impact of a blow (or slash or stab) is still felt, but the ghost’s
        body simply distends, adjusting to the effects of the strike.
        The player of a ghost who activates this Charm may roll
        her character’s full Dexterity + Craft (Moliation) pool
        against any attack the ghost is aware of. Every success
        subtracts one from the damage of a single lethal or bashing
        attack. This roll is made after the attack is resolved but
        before soak is applied.&lt;br&gt;
        Even if the blow does no damage, the ghost will
        usually be deformed by it in some way. A strike to the
        head will crush the shape of the ghost’s skull; a slash to
        the arm may deform it beyond recognition. The effects
        are merely cosmetic, however, and the deformation
        quickly heals itself. For every level of damage sopped up
        by the Yielding Spirit Form, it takes one turn for the
        ghost’s unliving tissue to restore itself to its original form.
        This process is constant, but additional damage absorbed
        during this time adds to the duration of the recovery.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Steeling the Spirit lets a ghost fix in place his altered
        features or form. A Willpower roll determines how many
        days the steeled flesh remains. The effect is extended for
        one day for each success. This power, however, can only be
        used by the ghost on himself.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition, when used in conjunction with Ghost-
        Devil Form to harden protrusions such as fangs, claws
        and the like, such accouterments are treated as if they
        are exceptional weapons and gain the same number of
        bonus points.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Ghost-Devil Form allows the ghost to adopt not just
        a new face, but rather, a new form entirely. This form can
        be human or otherwise and can sport working claws,
        talons, fangs and the like. A Ghost-Devil Form can be up
        to twice the ghost’s normal size and can feature such
        extras as additional working limbs, armor and so forth. It
        does not need to be human in the slightest, and the
        change from regular form to Ghost-Devil Form is effectively
        instantaneous.&lt;br&gt;
        Like Nine Terrors Visage, a Ghost-Devil Form must
        be conceptualized beforehand. Crafting a Ghost-Devil
        Form takes longer than making a Nine Terrors Visage,
        however, and is more difficult. Building a form requires an
        Intelligence + Craft (Moliation) roll to design and then a
        Dexterity + Compassion roll (Difficulty 3) to execute.
        Each damage-dealing or similar aspect of the form (claws,
        fangs, extra arms) requires an additional day of design work
        and an additional Craft (Moliation) roll at difficulty 2 to
        build. Ghost-Devil Form is also similar to Nine Terrors
        Visage in its duration and effects on observers. This Arcanos
        almost always has its effect extended through the use of
        Steeling the Spirit or some other, more powerful Charm of
        permanency. Only ghosts and ghostly beings can be re-
        shaped with the power of this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        When Weighted With the Anchor of Flesh, a ghost
        obtains the ability to materialize in the lands of the living.
        If he does so when in Ghost-Devil Form, then all of the
        weaponry available to him in that shape retains its potency.
        In short, the ghost materializes and can affect the
        living world normally, for good or for ill, until the Anchor
        lifts and he fades back to insubstantiality.&lt;br&gt;
        While held by the Anchor of Flesh, the ghost can be
        wounded by material weapons and is otherwise normal and
        material. If wounded, he will bleed (though the blood will
        fade as he does), and if struck down, he will fall before
        dissipating back into the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;
        The Anchor’s duration is one hour. However, the
        ghost can extend this by expending another point of
        Willpower for each additional hour he wishes to remain.
        Ghosts who have materialized thus are still vulnerable to
        banishment and to effects that specifically target material-
        ized spirits.

        Prerequisite Charms: Waxen Ghostly Flesh&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Stolen Wax Discipline allows a ghost to reshape the
        unliving tissues of another ghost. It only works on willing
        subjects but is useful for disguising friends, theatrical
        performances and the like.&lt;br&gt;
        Using Stolen Wax Discipline requires the laying of
        hands upon the target, as well as a successful Dexterity +
        Compassion roll. The difficulty of the roll depends on the
        degree of change being attempted (see Waxen Ghostly
        Flesh for a guideline to appropriate difficulties). The
        effects of the Arcanos last one hour per point of the
        shaping ghost’s permanent Essence and cannot be ex-
        tended through the use of Willpower. To extend its effects,
        either the ghost doing the shaping must use Prison of the
        New Form, or the ghost receiving the changes must use
        Steeling the Spirit.

        Prerequisite Charms: Stolen Wax Discipline
        Unlike Stolen Wax Discipline, Broken Mold Strike
        allows a ghost to inflict the horrors of reshaped flesh on an
        unwilling target. Using Broken Mold Strike requires a
        successful Brawl attack, which need do no damage, fol-
        lowed by a reflexive Strength + Compassion roll.
        A ghost attacking with Broken Mold Strike shreds
        and boils off the target’s ectoplasm doing a base lethal
        damage equal to the ghost’s Willpower + (successes on the
        Strength + Compassion roll) + any extra successes on the
        attack. This attack works only against other ghosts or
        against creatures that partake of ghostly nature and can be
        subjected to the Shifting Ghost-Clay Path. This does not
        include deathknights, whose physical substance shields
        them from this attack.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Shaping the Obedient Servant is the means by which
        a ghost can use the powers associated with Ghost-Devil
        Form on another. Frequently used by servants of the
        Deathlords to create monstrous ghostly warriors for battles
        among the dead, this power is also a favorite of artisans,
        costumers and others among the dead who depend on
        disguise as part of their livelihood.&lt;br&gt;
        Shaping the Obedient Servant requires the expenditure
        of the Arcanos cost, followed by the regular difficulty 3
        Dexterity + Compassion roll for Ghost-Devil Form. Obedient
        Servant shapes must be planned ahead of time, just like
        Ghost-Devil Form, but if all the results are going to look the
        same, only one roll needs to be made to plan the change.&lt;br&gt;
        Often, the Deathlords and their more powerful seneschals
        wish to make the effects of Shaping the Obedient
        Servant permanent. This can be accomplished through a
        successful Willpower roll and the expenditure of experience
        points on the part of the character being reshaped.
        The more experience points expended, the longer the
        effect lasts. A single experience point freezes it for a
        month, 2 points for a year, and 3 points extend the effect
        indefinitely. Essence is no longer committed to the effect
        once experience points are spent to extend it. This Arcanos
        works only on the dead.

        Prison of the New Form enables a ghost to seal her
        target into his current form, willing or no. The character
        must touch the target or make a successful unarmed
        Brawl or Martial Arts attack that need not do damage. A
        successful contested roll of the attacking ghost’s Stamina
        + Compassion against the target’s Conviction enables
        the ghost to lock down the victim’s form for one week per
        extra success. During this time, he cannot be affected by
        any other spirit-flesh crafting power that alters his form,
        but he remains vulnerable to damage from powers such as
        Broken Mold Strike. Prison of the New Form is often used
        to keep prisoners in an eyeless, mouthless or limbless
        state. Obviously, this Arcanos works only against ghosts
        or ghostly creatures.

        Ghosts are most comfortable in the dark of night, but
        that does not mean they always wish to go unseen in the
        darkness. Some ghosts wish to be seen, either to terrify the
        mortals who behold them or to illuminate the steps of
        those foolish enough to trust the dead as guides. By
        releasing 2 motes of Essence, a ghost can cause herself to
        glow with radiance as bright as the setting sun. Two or
        more ghosts acting in unison can combine their radiance,
        and when seven act in concert, the effect is as bright as the
        noonday sun in the Far Southern deserts. A ghost may
        choose to display any color, from the hideous green of
        grave mold to the warm gold of afternoon sunshine. When
        performed in the living world, the Corpse-Fed Radiance is
        visible even if the ghost is dematerialized.

        Darkness is more potent than light. Every dead man
        knows this. Thus does Black Breath of the Abyss surpass
        Corpse-Fed Radiance in the hierarchy of ghostly skills.&lt;br&gt;
        When summoned, the Black Breath of the Abyss is
        more than just a cloud of darkness. It is an utter absence of
        light that boils out of the ghost’s mouth, ears, nose and
        eyes. Devouring any normal source of light, the cloud
        extends for 10 feet around the ghost. If the ghost expends
        a Willpower point, the cloud will move in any direction of
        his choosing. Those caught in the cloud are utterly blinded
        — except ghosts, who can see through the darkness clearly.
        No light can penetrate its inky depths, and those trapped
        within subtract two successes from all attack rolls. The
        boundary for the Arcanos’ effect is as insubstantial as air
        and can be crossed simply by moving out of the area of
        effect, but the disorienting effect of the total darkness
        makes this difficult.&lt;br&gt;
        The Black Breath of the Abyss cannot be dispelled by
        normal light, though it will fade away in due time. The
        manifestation of a Solar anima banner within the cloud of
        darkness will also dispel it.

        Mere light is not always enough to work a ghost’s will.
        Storytellers among the dead use illusions to illustrate their

        the most basic tools of their trade.&lt;br&gt;

        with a basic color palette, immobile and faintly
        transparent. They can be as large as the ghost creating
        them wishes, though most of the Restless Dead prefer to
        keep their creations man-sized or smaller. Often, the
        images flicker or blur, revealing their artificial origins.&lt;br&gt;
        Painting the Sunset Picture requires a successful Wits
        + Craft (Pandemonium) roll against a difficulty of 1. More
        complicated illusions, such as the image of a tree individual
        leaves or a detailed reconstruction of the Palace
        Sublime are more difficult, and may reach as high as
        difficulty 3. The illusion’s appearance may move as fast or
        as slow as the ghostly creator wishes.&lt;br&gt;
        A ghost can sustain a Sunset Picture for an hour if she
        wishes by feeding it a point of Willpower. She can also
        create multiple illusions simultaneously, each with their
        own cost in Essence. Sunset Pictures that have run their
        course slowly fade away into transparency. The illusions of
        Painting the Sunset Picture are visible even when created
        in the lands of the living. The ghost need not materialize
        to make the illusions visible.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Any ghost with a modicum of training can create a
        simple illusion. It is far more difficult to create a complex
        one, one that moves, speaks and gives the appearance of life.
        Midnight Canvas Unfurled is the tool of choice for
        these masters of illusion, and it serves them well. By
        utilizing this Arcanos, a ghost may craft an illusion that
        exists in three dimensions and is capable of movement.
        With a successful Wits + Craft (Pandemonium) roll by his
        player, the ghost summons the fleshed out illusion. The
        difficulty of this Charm is the same as that of Painting the
        Sunset Picture; the larger and more complex the illusion is,
        the higher the difficulty. By spending 5 additional motes of
        Essence, the master of the illusion can cause the illusion to
        affect a sense beside sight. Sound is most often used, but
        true craftsmen among the dead take delight in creating
        illusions so complex that they fool the living. These
        phantasms will even obey their creator’s wishes to move or
        speak, so long as the wishes are simple. The image lasts a
        single scene, unless sustained with an investment of Will-
        power. A single point of Willpower will extend the illusion’s
        lifespan to an hour.&lt;br&gt;
        Only the past masters among the dead have ever
        created a Midnight Canvas larger than a behemoth,
        though the Deathlords do so with some regularity and
        disdain. However, the artisans of the dead have compensated
        by learning how to add other touches of realism to
        their creations.&lt;br&gt;
        The illusions of Midnight Canvas Unfurled, like
        those of Painting the Sunset Picture, are visible even when
        created in the lands of the living. The ghost need not
        materialize to make the illusions visible. They can be seen,
        even if he cannot.

        This Charm gives the user the ability to summon large
        quantities of any sort of foul, harmless fluid out of thin air,
        and it can be employed to terrify, disgust or disturb with
        equal ease. Those using it can summon up to (their
        Conviction rating x 10) gallons of any harmless fluid they
        choose — blood and squirming but harmless maggots are
        acceptable, acids and flammable oils are not. This liquid
        manifests on the walls, floors, ceilings and other surfaces
        nearby, at the ghost’s discretion.&lt;br&gt;
        The uses of this power can be as benign as filling a pot
        with water or as malicious as making blood drip out of
        walls. The fluid will remain in place until it dries up or
        drains away, but in that time, it will have no visible source,
        and its flow cannot be stemmed. While the ichor that is
        created cannot be directly harmful, it can have dangerous
        secondary effects, such as rendering a steep staircase slip-
        pery or smearing the ink on a precious document.

        This Charm creates vermin and gives them brief life.
        The Messenger takes the form of a deathwatch beetle, rat
        or other small creature. Instantly responsive to the will of
        its creator, the creature scuttles forth to work his will. At
        the end of an hour, the Messenger will shrivel and die, but
        its life can be extended another hour by the expenditure of
        another point of Willpower by the ghost who summoned
        it. Messengers can be killed as per normal creatures of their
        type; a simple sword thrust or even a well-placed boot heel
        will do for most.&lt;br&gt;
        Creating a Messenger requires a Wits + Pandemonium
        roll. The difficulty is 2 for an insect or similarly small
        creature, difficulty 3 for anything else up to the size of a
        large rat. Nothing larger can be created through the use of
        this Charm. The Messenger appears at the ghost’s feet and
        goes forth into the world to do his bidding. While the
        Messenger has enough rudimentary intelligence to obey
        the ghost’s mental commands, it is not a familiar and still
        cannot be pushed beyond its innate capabilities. For ex-
        ample, a summoned rat may be able to climb walls, but it’s
        still not going to be able to transcribe a document or make
        complex judgments about humans.&lt;br&gt;
        Messengers may have fangs or claws, but even those
        created in the image of a poisonous creature such as a spider
        do not have venom. A ghost need not be materialized in
        order to use this Charm. Her odious minion will appear in
        the world of the living unless this Charm is used in the
        Underworld or in a shadowland at night.

        &lt;br&gt;
        One rat. One spider. One serpent. A single example
        of any of these species can be overlooked, swatted or
        stepped on. A flood of them, however, is not so easy to
        dismiss. Six Plague Summons lets a ghost create and send
        forth an entire horde of vermin, which will happily swarm
        over, devour or trample anything before it. All that is
        required is the investment of Essence and Willpower and
        a successful Wits + Pandemonium roll (difficulty 2 for
        anything up to a mouse in size, 3 for anything up to a rat).&lt;br&gt;
        A Six Plague Summons can include anywhere from a
        half-dozen to thousands of creatures, depending on the
        success of the initial roll. The more successes scored, the
        more creatures, with the number going up by a factor of five
        for each success.&lt;br&gt;
        Number of Successes Approximate Number of Creatures Summoned&lt;br&gt;
        0 1-10&lt;br&gt;
        1 50&lt;br&gt;
        2 250&lt;br&gt;
        3 1250&lt;br&gt;
        4 6250&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Successes beyond four produce what is, for all
        intents and purposes, a numberless swarm.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The downside is that a plague thus summoned is
        extremely difficult to control. The ghost who brings it
        forth can give it some rough direction (“Go east!” or
        “Chase him!”) but not much more than that. Vermin
        brought forth through this Charm are also ravenously
        hungry, making them even more difficult to control.
        Fortunately, the plague lasts one hour and one hour only
        and cannot be extended beyond that. A ghost need not be
        materialized in order to use this Charm. In fact, her
        festering swarm always appears in the world of the living,
        unless she invokes this Charm in the Underworld or at
        night in a shadowland.

        Not all of the dead are content to paint pictures in the
        air. Some wish to affect the lands of the living in a more
        tangible way. Hand of the Wind lets these ghosts reach out
        with more-than-ghostly force.&lt;br&gt;
        By exercising this Arcanos, the ghost fortifies his
        being with his will for an instant. During that time, he is
        capable of one action that affects the world of flesh as if he
        were a part of it. Whether that consists of striking a blow,
        stealing a trinket or pushing an archer lining up a shot is
        entirely up to the ghost. Any action the ghost takes is
        subject to an appropriate roll (The player of a ghost trying
        to snatch a First Age relic out of an enemy’s hand would
        have to roll Dexterity + Larceny, for example, while the
        player of one seeking to pick up an abandoned dagger and
        hurl it would roll Dexterity + Thrown). The ghost himself
        cannot be struck by mortal weapons during this time, as he
        is not actually materialized.&lt;br&gt;
        Note that Hand of the Wind can be used for only
        one action at a time, though with a loose definition of
        “one action.” Picking something up and throwing it is
        considered one action; holding a pen and writing a
        several thousand line epic poem is not. In general, there
        is not enough time for characters to split their dice pool.
        Hand of the Wind cannot be used in the Underworld.
        Its uses are limited to the living world and during the
        day in the shadowlands.

        &lt;br&gt;
        What Strike of Dead Hands gives a ghost is physical
        power, pure and simple. By adding brute force to a blow
        enabled by Hand of the Wind, the ghost suddenly makes
        his interactions with the world of the living that much
        more devastating.&lt;br&gt;
        Strike of Dead Hands lasts, like its antecedent, for just
        one attack, but it is far more potent. Any attacks or
        Strength-based actions undertaken with this Arcanos
        have one additional automatic success, and any blow
        struck has additional lethal damage dice equal to the
        ghost’s Strength rating, meaning that the ghost’s Strength
        effectively doubles for the purposes of damage on the blow.
        Ghosts can use this Charm to strike blows with weapons,
        and a ghost armed with a daiklave can be a menace to an
        Exalt who cannot attack spirits. The ghost has no fine
        control of Strike of Dead Hands and, thus, cannot temper
        a blow or pull a punch when using it.

        &lt;br&gt;
        One of the ultimate powers of the dead, Ebon Grasp of
        Oblivion strikes mercilessly and takes its victims back with
        it into the depths of the Abyss. Emerging from the ghosts
        facial orifices like the Black Breath, the Ebon Grasp mauls
        those it strikes, savaging their flesh and spirits. Those who
        are struck down by the Ebon Grasp are seized by it and taken,
        screaming, into the depths of the Underworld.
        All who are within a five-yard radius of the ghost’s
        mouth and eyes (other than the ghost activating the
        Arcanos) are subject to the Ebon Grasp’s hideous effects.
        Each turn the Ebon Grasp touches a target gives the cloud
        a reflexive Strength + Brawl attack against the victim,
        using the summoning ghost’s statistics. A successful attack
        does Strength + 2 lethal damage. If the target is reduced to
        Incapacitated or below, the next turn the cloud picks him
        up and begins dragging him into the Abyss. This process
        takes two turns to complete, during which time he can be
        rescued by a contested Strength roll against the cloud.
        Victims who are not rescued are drawn into the Abyss
        through the physical form of the summoning ghost, a
        disturbing and obscene process. The Ebon Grasp can be
        fought like any other physical threat. It does not dodge, has
        a soak of 6L/12B, has eight health levels and takes no
        wound penalties. It uses the characters Traits and acts on
        initiative 10. The Ebon Grasp of Oblivion ignores all
        attacks that do less that its soak, and weapons not made
        from the Five Magical Materials, subjected to Elemental
        Enchantment or otherwise enhanced do only bashing
        damage to the Ebon Grasp.

        By exploiting their ghostly nature, the dead can cause
        the distortions of time, space and speed peculiar to night-
        mares to become manifest reality. The ghost possessing
        this Charm can move with incredible speed, cover impossible
        distances and strike many times as time for her victim
        slows to a dreamy crawl.&lt;br&gt;
        Though the special effects of this Charm are of night-
        mare sensory distortion, the mechanical effect is one of
        extra actions. The player of the ghost invoking the Arcanos
        rolls Intelligence + Craft (Pandemonium). For every success,
        the ghost gains an extra action that turn, but the
        number of extra actions cannot exceed the ghost’s permanent
        Essence. These extra actions cannot be saved from
        turn to turn. Other than its unusual special effects, Flying
        Time Technique is a normal Extra Action Charm and
        subject to the usual restrictions.

            Staggered Dark Stars Movement allows a powerful
            ghost to take advantage of Setesh’s Calendar in such a way
            as to allow hours to pass like moments for himself. The
            ghost simply pushes his own path further along Setesh’s
            Calendar than those around him. The Charm allows the
            ghost to “skip” over minutes or hours. To the ghost, it
            seems as though time simply jumps forward a few minutes
            or hours. To those watching, the ghost seems to disappear,
            only to return after a few minutes or hours. The ghost’s
            player must roll Intelligence + Occult, and for every
            success, the ghost can jump forward up to 30 minutes. The
            player rolls and determines the maximum amount of time
            the character can leap forward. After that maximum
            duration is determined, the character picks any amount of
            time up to that maximum that he wishes to jump. Note
            that the ghost cannot perceive events that happen in the
            interim, nor can he make conditional jumps — “jump
            forward until these guys leave” is not permitted. This
            Arcanos is a fine way to escape combat, but the ghost
            cannot jump backward. Any time he skips over is forever
            lost to him. This Charm can only be used in the Under-
            world, as Setesh’s Calendar has no power over Creation.

            Hours Like Autumn Leaves allows the most powerful

            jump forward in time. Observers see all ghosts affected by
            the Charm vanish, only to reappear later. The player of
            the ghost using this Charm must roll Intelligence +
            Occult and the ghost must spend 6 motes for himself and
            every entity to be dragged forward with him, as well as 1
            Willpower per being. For every success, the whole group
            can be moved forward in time up to 30 minutes. The

            the group can leap forward, and after that maximum
            duration is determined, the character picks any amount

            interim, nor can he make conditional jumps — “jump
            forward until these guys leave” is not permitted. The total
            span jumped is at the discretion of the ghost using this
            Charm (those brought along have no control over the
            span of time over which they jump). Willing subjects of
            this Charm should be within 10 yards of the ghost using
            it. An unwilling subject can only be brought along if the
            ghost is physically touching her.&lt;br&gt;
            It is rumored that the ghosts of Stygia have a more
            powerful version of this Charm that allows ghosts to leap
            forward years, rather than hours.

        &lt;br&gt;
        One of the most common hazards of ghostly existence
        are roving packs of hungry ghosts. Mindless and driven by
        inhuman appetites, they roam the across the worlds, constantly
        searching for prey, living or otherwise. As such, it
        behooves a clever ghost to be aware of these potential
        hazards, and Taste the Demon Wind allows a ghost to do
        exactly that.&lt;br&gt;
        When a ghost uses this power, a successful roll of
        Perception + Presence renders her aware of the number,
        direction and location of any hungry ghosts in the vicinity.
        The more successes rolled, the further out hungry ghosts
        can be detected.&lt;br&gt;

        5 5 miles&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Taste the Demon Wind must be used consciously. The
        ghost must be actively listening for hungry ghosts, or else,
        this Arcanos is useless. The way in which the power manifests
        varies from spirit to spirit. Some detect hungry ghosts
        as a foul odor or a sudden chill, while others claim to be able
        to suddenly hear their howling, even from great distances.&lt;br&gt;
        Once a ghost has detected a hungry ghost, she is then
        aware of its location at all times until it leaves her range.
        Hungry ghosts are not aware they’ve been found out, nor
        are they usually clever enough to lope outside of range and
        then return, undetected.

        Summoning a hungry ghost — or a pack of them — is
        not the brightest thing a ghost can do. However, there are
        times when it makes sense to do so. The arrival of a pack
        of hungry ghosts can provide excellent cover for an escape,
        and some of the more advanced Arcanoi also provide uses
        for hungry ghosts that arrive.&lt;br&gt;
        The use of Call the Ravening Hound requires a
        successful Manipulation + Presence roll. The more successes
        scored, the further away the hungry ghosts may be
        that are summoned (and the more who are likely to heed
        the call). Bear in mind, however, that if one hungry ghost
        suddenly bolts in response to a summons, the rest of his
        pack may follow of its own volition.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        When a ghost uses this power successfully, a cold,
        unearthly shrieking rises up from where he is standing.
        This radiates outward to the limits of the Arcanos’
        effective range. Any hungry ghosts within the range will
        howl in response, and the nearest to the summoning
        ghost will respond. This initial call is very distinctive,
        and those who are familiar with the use of the Arcanos
        will be able to recognize it for what it is. This practice is
        highly illegal in civilized portions of the Underworld.
        Those caught using Call the Ravening Hound face enslavement
        or worse as punishment for deliberately
        attracting the scourge of hungry ghosts.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Hungry ghosts are relentless, savage hunters. This is why
        many ghosts find it useful to unleash them on their enemies.
        Placing the Relentless Hunter’s Mark on a victim immediately
        makes that individual the center of attention for any
        hungry ghost in the vicinity, as well as any he stumbles across
        while the Mark endures. A pale white handprint outlined in
        angry red, the Mark calls hungry ghosts to itself like raw meat
        calls hungry dogs, and it whips those hungry ghosts into a
        frenzy of anger against the Mark’s bearer.&lt;br&gt;
        The Mark can be placed on an individual or on an
        item such as a breastplate or weapon. To place the Relent-
        less Hunter’s Mark, a ghost’s player must make a successful
        Dexterity + Brawl roll for his character to touch the target,
        then succeed on a Manipulation + Presence roll (difficulty
        2). The Mark then remains in place on the target for an
        hour, highly visible to all. Hungry ghosts will react to the
        Mark immediately and will pursue the victim relentlessly
        until either they or their target is brought down. Once the
        Mark fades, hungry ghosts will no longer be unnaturally
        drawn to the character, but if they’re already hunting her,
        they won’t suddenly stop.&lt;br&gt;
        While the basic Mark fades after an hour, some ghosts
        are skilled at prolonging its effects. The expenditure of a
        single experience point when placing the Relentless
        Hunter’s Mark on a target seals it in place for a year and a
        day. Spending 2 makes it permanent.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The flip side of detecting the location of a nearby
        hungry ghost is preventing it from detecting you. While
        ghosts of power can deal with even a pack of hungry ghosts
        with minimal risk of destruction, not every restless spirit is
        so capable. Even those who can put down a hungry ghost
        should the situation require it often prefer to avoid any
        confrontation on general principle.&lt;br&gt;
        With that in mind, many ghosts become skilled in the
        exercise of Diversion of the Savage Hunger. The successful
        use of this Arcanos effectively removes a ghost from the
        perception of any nearby hungry ghosts. A successful
        Perception + Presence roll is required (difficulty 2), but
        once success is achieved, the hungry ghost or ghosts are no
        longer a problem — a single successful use hides a ghost
        from all hungry ghosts until the end of the scene. Any
        attack on the hungry ghosts or otherwise ostentatious
        display of the hiding ghost’s presence negates the effect of
        Diversion of the Savage Hunger and leaves the ghost
        vulnerable to attack once again.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Tame the Wicked Appetite does exactly what its
        name suggests: It soothes the driving passion of hungry
        ghosts, rendering them passive and calm. Hungry ghosts
        that are affected will simply lay down in their tracks or
        wander around dazed. If attacked, they will return to their
        customary savagery, but if not attacked, they will be dull
        and passive until the Arcanos’ power wears off. They will
        not even resist attempts to chain or muzzle them, though
        once they feel their bonds they may become more violent.&lt;br&gt;
        Using Tame the Wicked Appetite requires a roll of
        Charisma + Presence. The more successes obtained, the
        more hungry ghosts that can be dealt with. Any hungry
        ghost struck by the usage of Tame the Wicked Appetite
        will fall prey to it immediately, whether it is wandering the
        shadowlands or in mid-pounce. This Charm has a maximum
        range of (the ghost’s Valor x 10) yards.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        The hungry ghosts’ hunger remains sated for the
        duration of a single scene, though for the cost of another
        mote of Essence, the ghost using the Arcanos can extend
        the effect for an hour. Furthermore, by spending an experience
        point, the ghost can make the effect permanent,
        rendering the affected hungry ghosts permanently deprived
        of their appetites. This expenditure releases any
        Essence committed to the Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        There are times when it is not enough to divert a
        hungry ghost. Occasionally, it is useful to harness the
        ravening power of a hungry ghost to one’s own ends. Thus
        was developed the ability to Command the Hungry Devil.
        This Arcanos allows a ghost to issue a single, irresistible
        command to a hungry ghost. The command itself must be
        obeyed to the letter and to the best of the hungry ghost’s
        ability, even if it leads to swift destruction.&lt;br&gt;
        To Command the Hungry Devil requires a successful
        Manipulation + Presence roll, difficulty 2. The more successes
        achieved, the more hungry ghosts can be commanded.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Number of Successes Number of Hungry Ghosts Commanded&lt;br&gt;
        1 1&lt;br&gt;
        2 3&lt;br&gt;

        4 10&lt;br&gt;
        5 20&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The command need not be a single word, as a relatively
        simple sentence can be understood by a hungry
        ghost. “Stop” is a perfectly acceptable use of Command the
        Hungry Devil, with the understanding that the hungry
        ghost is free to start again a moment later. More effective
        are commands such as “Attack him!” or “Go back to the
        corpse that spawned you!” On the other hand, any ghost
        who issues a complex command such as “Invade the Prince
        of Shadows’ citadel and bring me his left-handed gauntlet”
        is going to be disappointed. If the order given is too
        complex, the target ghost will remain motionless for a turn
        and then resume its former attitude. Hungry ghosts will,
        however, attempt to fulfill impossible commands, so long
        as they are simple enough to be understood.

        There are some among the dead who devote their
        existence to dealing with the scourge of hungry ghosts in
        a most unusual fashion — by taming them. These spirits
        are masters of Ghostly Harness Exercise, which allows
        them to soothe hungry ghosts’ savage nature for extended
        periods of time. While hungry ghosts marked by this
        power maintain their capacity for savagery, they are no
        longer constantly ravenous and can be trained. They
        even form a bond of sorts with the ghost who tames them,
        and so long as they are tamed, they will not attack him
        under any circumstances. This includes while under the
        influence of Command the Hungry Devil. Of course, the
        hungry ghost trainer must keep his end of the bargain,
        taking care of his charges, spending time with them and
        feeding them appropriately.&lt;br&gt;
        Hungry ghosts tamed with this power can be used as
        watchdogs or bodyguards. Some ghosts use them as fight-
        ing animals in tournaments and underground betting pits,
        but most feel that this is an unnecessary expense. Without
        the effects of Ghostly Harness Exercise, the task of training
        a hungry ghost is utterly impossible. Even with the Charm,
        training is a time-consuming process and requires a month
        of intense work with harness, whip and fist. However, once
        the hungry ghost has been trained, it is trained forever.&lt;br&gt;
        Tamed hungry ghosts function in much the same way
        trained hounds do for mortals, obeying simple commands,
        leaping to their owners’ defense and eagerly awaiting the
        chance to hunt.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Spirit-Handling Leash is not nearly so powerful as its
        prerequisite. It does, however, have one virtue that Ghostly
        Harness Exercise lacks: versatility. It allows a trainer to
        transfer a tamed hungry ghost’s loyalty to a new owner,
        quickly, easily and permanently. The trainer is still regarded
        with some, for lack of a better term, affection, but
        it is to its new owner that the hungry ghost now shows its
        utter devotion. The Spirit-Handling Leash will remain in
        place permanently, and the hungry ghost whose affections
        have been transferred will regard its owner with the same
        affection it once gave its trainer. The hungry ghost will
        hunt, guard or attack at its owner’s command and will
        never attack the holder of the Spirit-Handling Leash. It is
        not uncommon to see servants of wealthy and noble ghosts
        walking the streets of the necropoli with leashed packs of
        hungry ghosts snuffling out ahead of them, a plain symbol
        of their power for all to see.

        Aura-Reading Technique allows a ghost to see how
        much Essence another being — be it a ghost, another spirit
        or an Exalted — contains within her. Use of Aura-Reading
        Technique requires a successful Perception + Larceny roll.
        If the roll is successful, the ghost can perceive the aura of
        anything he looks at for a single scene. This allows the ghost
        to literally see the Essence burbling within the target. The
        ghost cannot do anything about this, nor can he share his
        vision with another. However, this technique does allow
        him to assess those he comes in contact with quickly.&lt;br&gt;
        To a ghost using Aura-Reading Technique, the color
        of the target’s aura correlates to the amount of Essence she
        contains. The “aura” the Arcanos displays is not a true
        aura. Rather, it is a colorful display that, to the ghost’s eyes,
        appears to overlay the target’s silhouette. It is visible
        regardless of ambient light, but the ghost must be aware of
        the target’s presence before he can use Aura-Reading
        Technique. In other words, it this Charm cannot be used
        for detection, only assessment.&lt;br&gt;

        There is no way for the target of an Aura-Reading
        Technique to know that she has been spied upon in this
        manner. The Technique has an effective range equal to
        the ghost’s sight range, and as such, ghosts skilled in its
        usage are often used as lookouts by the Deathlords.

        Delicious Essence Scent does not allow a ghost to
        determine how much Essence someone contains. Rather,
        it enables the ghost to sniff out living sources of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        To use Delicious Essence Scent, the ghost spends a
        mote of Essence, and his player makes a Perception +
        Dexterity roll (difficulty 2). A success immediately fills the
        ghost’s nostrils with the scent of Essence, which the ghost
        can follow to its source. The stronger the source, the more
        potent the trail, and the easier it is for the ghost to follow.
        The ghost’s player makes a Perception + Temperance roll,
        with a difficulty equal to (4 - the permanent Essence of the
        target [minimum 1]). If the roll is successful, the ghost is
        aware of the character’s location and permanent Essence.
        The power has a range of 100 yards.&lt;br&gt;
        As the ghost is detecting pure Essence, Delicious
        Essence Scent pierces illusions, veils and disguises that do
        not also cloak the character’s magical nature. If anything
        living is within range, Delicious Essence Scent can find it.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch lets a ghost absorb
        another ghost’s Essence through the brush of a fingertip.
        Any touch is sufficient to let the ghost drain the target’s
        energies, though it must, in fact, be a touch. Mere proximity
        is not enough for Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch to
        work. To use Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch, the ghost
        must succeed on an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack,
        which need do no damage.&lt;br&gt;
        When the power activates, the player of the ghost
        makes a difficulty 2 Manipulation + Larceny roll. Each
        success on the roll strips away 2 motes of Essence from the
        victim. This Essence does not flow to the ghost. Rather, it
        dissipates and can be used by no one. When Essence-Devouring
        Ghost Touch is used by several ghosts in
        conjunction, it is a deadly tactic. In particular, it is a
        favorite tool of hungry ghosts, who use it to swarm victims
        under when hunting. This Charm only works on
        ghosts and beings of a ghostly nature.

        Essence wasted by Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch. After this
        Arcanos is invoked, at any point later in the turn, the ghost
        may make a Temperance roll (difficulty 1). A success lets her
        absorb a number of motes equal to half the number stripped
        from the target. These motes are then available for her use, if
        necessary allowing her to retrigger Essence-Devouring Ghost
        Touch.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Ravening Life-Force Hunger removes the protection the
        living have against the scourge of Essence-Devouring Ghost
        Touch. Not only does Ravening Life-Force Hunger affect
        ghosts, it also affects other spirits, Exalted and any other beings
        unfortunate enough to encounter it. The ghost must be
        materialized for the power to work, however. The technique
        for using Ravening Life-Force Hunger is precisely identical
        to that for Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch. Each success on
        the Manipulation + Larceny roll dissipates 2 motes of Essence
        for each success. The Essence dissipates and cannot be used
        by anyone. Non-Essence channelers who are affected by this
        Charm have their breath disrupted. Those whose players succeed
        at a Stamina + Endurance roll (difficulty 3) will survive,
        those whose players fail will be incapacitated by chills and mad
        hallucinations by the time the sun next crosses the horizon.
        They will die in (their Stamina) days unless they are tended by
        a character with Medicine 3 or higher who can correct their
        disrupted life rhythms.

        Blood-Drinking Thirst does not literally drain blood
        or, indeed, any fluid from the victim, but it does allow
        the ghost to steal the strength of a being besides another
        ghost. It makes available for the ghost’s use the Essence
        drained by Ravening Life-Force Hunger. When this Arcanos
        is active, whenever the ghost uses Ravening Life-Force
        Hunger or Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch, she
        can spend a Willpower for her player to make a reflexive
        Temperance roll (difficulty 1). Success lets her absorb a
        number of motes equal to the number stripped from the
        target, which are instantly available for her use. Her Essence
        cannot be increase beyond its maximum through
        the use of this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Blending the Streams of Essence reverses the flow of
        energy from Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch. Instead of
        draining Essence from the victim, Blending the Streams
        of Essence allows a ghost to give some of her own energy
        to another ghost, which he can then use for whatever
        purpose he desires. This energy can be used instantly by
        the recipient.&lt;br&gt;
        Using Blending the Streams of Essence requires a
        physical touch. If the target resists, it must be delivered
        as part of a successful unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack,
        which need do no damage. Once physical contact
        is made, the donor ghost’s player must succeed on a Temperance
        roll (difficulty 1). If it succeeds, she may transfer
        a number of motes equal to her Willpower rating to the
        intended recipient. He can, if he chooses, refuse the in-
        fusion, in which case the Essence is lost. The Essence
        given comes from the ghost’s own pool, and the ghost
        can never reduce her temporary Essence pool below 1
        with his Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Blending the Streams of Essence can only be used
        on one ghost per scene. It is only effective on ghosts,
        and any attempt to use it on a living being wastes the
        ghost’s energies.

        Feeding Life’s Fountain allows a ghost to transfer his
        Essence to a living recipient. All of the rules and restrictions
        of Blending the Streams of Essence apply. If used
        on non-Essence-channelers, the effect is one of extreme
        good health and lasts for (the Essence of the ghost activating
        the Arcanos x the number of motes spent) days.
        The victim will have one automatic success on all Stamina
        + Resistance or Stamina + Endurance rolls to resist
        illness or poisoning and will not become ill from fatigue
        even if they eat badly or live under bad conditions. Living
        recipients are also very fertile, and it is through this
        Charm that ancestors answer their descendents’ fertility
        problems. This Charm cannot cure actual sterility, only
        reproductive difficulties. Giving birth to the child is often
        difficult for or fatal to the mother if she had difficulty
        bearing live children or carrying them to term.

        Masters of this technique create the gems and crystals
        laden with Essence that fuel the Underworld’s society.
        Filling the Precious Vial is nothing less than the
        ability to take one’s own Essence and pour it into an
        inanimate container for anyone to use.&lt;br&gt;
        Putting this power to use requires both the preparation
        of a suitable container, such as an Essence-containing
        gem or soulfire crystal and a Perception + Larceny
        roll (difficulty 2). Before the roll, the ghost’s player must
        announce the number of motes to be invested in the object.
        If the roll is a success, the motes are expended and
        the Essence is sealed in the container. Containers used
        for holding Essence are rare and delicate things. Soulfire
        crystals (see p. 254) are the most popular, followed by
        Essence-containing gems (see p. 255), though there are
        other options such as small carvings and mirrors that enjoy
        a certain amount of popularity. An Essence container
        that is cracked, however, is liable to go up in a massive
        explosion, doing one level of lethal damage per mote
        stored inside to anyone within 10 feet of the blast.&lt;br&gt;
        If the Willpower point is not spent activating this
        Charm, the Vial is still filled, but it will leak a mote a
        day. The expenditure of the Willpower seals the Vial and
        traps the Essence inside.

            With this Arcanos, a ghost may sire offspring with a
            human, God-Blood or Exalted woman. The ghost must be
            materialized, either through Weighted With the Anchor
            of Flesh (see E:Ab, p. 237) or by siring the child in a
            shadowland at night. It is also possible for the living to
            facilitate mating with copious doses of ghost flower tea (see
            Manacle and Coin, p. 45). Fertile Soul Endowment automatically
            fails in the Underworld, as the very principles of
            that dark realm oppose life. The ghost need not actually
            copulate with the living partner, though the two must
            exchange a minimum of a deep, passionate kiss. As such,
            female ghosts may use this Arcanos as readily as males.
            Finally, the living partner cannot already be pregnant.&lt;br&gt;
            If all the appropriate conditions are met, the ghost's
            player rolls Temperance + Essence against a difficulty of
            the partner's Essence rating. Ghosts with appropriate
            Passions may also channel them for additional dice, as
            normal. A failure means the living partner's Essence re-
            jects the energies and no conception takes place. A botch
            means the partner immediately becomes sterile unless her
            player makes a successful Stamina + Resistance roll (difficulty
            2). Exalted and other magical beings do not risk
            sterility from such a union.&lt;br&gt;
            A successful roll on the part of the ghost means the
            partner immediately conceives a Ghost-Blooded offspring,
            which she then carries to term normally. The living partner
            need not be willing or even know that conception has taken
            place. Essence used to power this Arcanos remains commit-
            ted until the birth of the child. The ghost may not voluntarily
            withdraw this commitment, and even the destruction of the
            ghost does not release the Essence prior to birth or end the
            pregnancy. A Ghost-Blooded child born of such a union will
            have innate power appropriate to the total Essence of its
            parents as normal. Ghosts that sire offspring upon Exalted
            women are more apt to produce Half-Caste children, though
            the Arcanos still affords the certainty of conception.

        Death sharpens a ghost’s perceptions. Ghosts can see
        better than mortals, can spot flaws more easily and can
        pick out the living from the dead at great distances. Some
        ghosts, however, have acquired even better methods of
        perception, and Spirit-Catching Eye Technique is one of
        them. This power lets a ghost see other ghosts who might
        normally be hidden from the eye. Ghosts who possess
        mortals or travel inside the bodies of other ghosts may be
        able to hide from normal observers, but Spirit-Catching
        Eye Technique reveals them.&lt;br&gt;
        When invoked, any ghosts or other spirits within view
        suddenly seem to glow with a pale white light. If the ghost
        is possessing a mortal, the ghost’s face overlays the host’s.
        If ghosts are traveling in another ghost’s body, each is
        distinctly illuminated through the host’s ectoplasmic flesh,
        which becomes transparent. The power lasts only an
        instant, and the ghost may or may not (reflexive Perception
        + Awareness roll, difficulty 2) be able to recognize the
        ghostly faces she sees hiding in mortal or unliving flesh.&lt;br&gt;
        Those spotted by use of this power are not aware
        they’ve been noticed, unless the ghost doing the spotting
        gives the game away through a reaction of some sort.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This technique allows a ghost to sense a target’s
        surface thoughts and feelings, picking up the rough gist of
        what the target is thinking about, as well as any strong
        emotions he might be experiencing. While this power does
        not allow the ghost to go rummaging through a victim’s
        subconscious, it does allow her to go &amp;quot;along for the ride,&amp;quot;
        as it were, and pick up knowledge pertaining to what the
        victim is doing at the moment. If the victim is reciting a
        password to pass an enchanted guardian, the ghost will
        hear it, but if the victim is trying on various pairs of shoes,
        it’s highly unlikely the password will come to the surface of
        his mind.&lt;br&gt;
        The use of Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline first
        requires the acquisition of a target. The victim must be
        within sight of the ghost, though no physical contact is
        required. (Once psychic contact is made, the ghost no
        longer needs to maintain proximity.) After a target has
        been identified, the next step is a Manipulation + Awareness
        roll (difficulty equal to the target’s Essence). Success
        on this roll allows the ghost to make contact. While
        contact is established, the ghost “hears” the target’s
        thoughts. She does not see through his eyes or hear
        through his ears. However, the victim’s thoughts are easily
        distinguishable from the ghost’s own.&lt;br&gt;
        Contact lasts for a single scene, though the ghost can
        extend it for another scene by spending a Willpower point.
        The ghost can continue to do this until she runs out of
        Willpower, if she so chooses. The victim does not know
        that his thoughts are being eavesdropped on, although
        Exalted and anyone with a Compassion of 3 or above may
        (Perception + Awareness, difficulty 1) have the distinct
        feeling he’s being watched.&lt;br&gt;
        Contact with the target is broken at the end of the
        scene, if the target is killed or rendered unconscious or if
        the ghost doing the eavesdropping is wounded or otherwise
        distracted (including any expenditure of Willpower
        for any other reason than to extend this Charm). This
        Arcanos works on ghosts as well as mortals.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Skin-Riding Prana builds upon the base established
        by Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline. However, in
        addition to allowing a ghost to simply skim the surface of
        the target’s mind, he can now make full use of the target’s
        senses. He can see through the victim’s eyes, hear through
        her ears and even catch the scent of whatever the target
        sniffs.&lt;br&gt;
        While Skin-Riding Prana is active, the input from the
        target overlays what the ghost himself sees and hears in a
        distant, transparent fashion. If the ghost concentrates, he
        can easily make out what the target is seeing and hearing.
        If there are distractions around the character, paying
        attention to both sensory inputs requires a Willpower roll,
        difficulty 1. Many practitioners of this power prefer to
        retreat to specially prepared chambers or tents if they can
        once contact has been established, the better to protect
        themselves from any outside input.&lt;br&gt;
        Other than the obvious, Skin-Riding Prana functions
        in the same way as does Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline.
        The victim must be within sight of the ghost, though
        no touch is required. After a target has been identified, the
        next step is a Manipulation + Awareness roll (difficulty
        equal to the target’s Essence). Success on this roll allows
        the ghost to make contact, and once psychic contact is
        made, the ghost no longer needs to maintain proximity.
        This Arcanos works on ghosts as well as mortals.

        A Six Demon Bag is a boon to ghostly smugglers,
        assassins and couriers of all persuasions. It is equally the
        bane of border patrols, bodyguards and customs agents.
        This power allows a ghost to create a hollow within
        herself in which she can store small items without a hint
        of evidence.&lt;br&gt;
        When using a Six Demon Bag, the ghost tears open a
        gap in her flesh and inserts the item to be carried there —
        be it cash, a dagger, a scroll or anything else inert and up
        to one cubic foot in area — into the hollow thus created.
        The ghost’s flesh is then sealed up around it, and the item
        rests more or less comfortably within the ghost herself.
        Experienced couriers know to sheathe weapons and the
        like, lest a smuggled knife cut its way out during a particularly
        energetic moment.&lt;br&gt;
        The mechanical effect of this Charm is to add +4
        difficulty to a searching character’s player’s Perception +
        Awareness roll when contesting the Wits + Larceny roll
        the smuggler’s player makes to conceal an object. Removing
        the object from the Six Demon Bag costs an
        additional 3 motes of Essence. The ghost can eject the
        item from her body at any time, or she can wait for the
        Arcanos to expire, at which point the item pops out on
        its own. The item can be cut out of the ghost in question
        as well. This doesn’t cost the additional 3 motes, but it
        does inflict damage on the ghost — three health levels of
        unsoakable lethal damage. Items carried in a Six Demon
        Bag do show up when the ghost is viewed with Spirit-
        Catching Eye Technique. This negates the Charm’s
        bonus, but the ghost’s player can still make a Wits +
        Larceny roll for the ghost to shield the compartment.

        Prerequisite Charms: Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Mortal-Shadowing Technique is the next step on the
        road to possession. A ghost using Mortal-Shadowing Technique
        can literally meld into a mortal’s body, journeying
        with him and experiencing all that he experiences. This
        includes everything from ecstasy to death, though the
        latter forces the ghost out of the host’s body.
        Activation of this power requires, first of all, finding
        a target. Once the ghost has a target, she has merely to
        touch him or make an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack that need do no damage. Her player then makes a
        Dexterity + Awareness roll, with a difficulty equal to the
        target’s permanent Essence. If the roll is successful, the
        ghost sinks into the flesh of her host and will journey with
        him wherever he goes and whatever he does.&lt;br&gt;
        The host is unaware of the ghost unless she breaks her
        silence or otherwise gives herself away, but once he is aware,
        he can spend a Willpower point for his player to make a
        contested Willpower roll against the ghost. If the ghost
        loses, she is ejected from the body. If not, she remains.
        If the host is killed, the ghost is immediately forced
        out of the body. Note that while using Mortal-Shadowing
        Technique, the ghost cannot control or otherwise affect
        the body that she is &amp;quot;possessing.&amp;quot; She is merely a passenger,
        albeit an awake and aware one. Interestingly enough, any
        damage done to the host body manifests as bashing damage
        on the ghost.&lt;br&gt;
        Spending an additional Willpower point extends the
        effect for a day. More than one ghost at a time can use
        Mortal-Shadowing Technique, but if one extends control
        to the level of Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand, the rest are
        ejected instantly, with the host none the wiser.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Unlike Mortal Shadowing Technique, this Arcanos
        allows for true possession. Once in command of the
        mortal body, the ghost truly controls it. She can use any
        of the body’s Attributes and Abilities, but she is not privy
        to the host’s secrets or knowledge. If the victim is Exalted,
        she can use all his attunements and automatic
        effects, and any reflexive effects the Exalt activates to
        preserve his frame, but the ghost has no access to the
        Exalt’s Charms. The ghost can also use her Arcanoi,
        including those involving effects to the ghost’s body such
        as Ghost-Devil Form. Any transformation and reshaping
        lapses the instant the ghost departs the victim’s frame.
        The puppeteer uses her own Essence and not the host’s to
        power any Arcanoi she activates.&lt;br&gt;
        Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand requires a Dexterity +
        Compassion roll with a difficulty equal to twice the target’s
        permanent Essence. The possessing ghost may extend the
        effects of this Charm for an additional hour by expending
        1 Willpower per hour, but her player must succeed at the
        possession roll again each time the duration is extended.
        During the possession, the body’s native intelligence is
        removed from authority and has no awareness of what his
        body does while it is possessed unless the ghost wants to let
        him watch. Needless to say, this can produce some awkward
        situations, as the ghost is under no obligation to leave
        the host in better shape than she found him.&lt;br&gt;
        If so possessed, the reflexive Charms of one of the
        Exalted continue to defend his body. The Exalt’s player
        should decide intelligently what reflexives activate when,
        but the consciousness of the Exalt is not making the
        decisions, the player is just portraying the character’s
        supernatural combat training.

        This Arcanos allows a ghost to acquire a host more
        pliable and convenient than a living human. Instead of a
        living host, he possesses a corpse and manipulates its dead
        flesh as a ghost using Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand manipulates
        the living. Because there is no resistance, the
        character’s player need only succeed in a difficulty 1
        Strength + Compassion roll for the ghost to inhabit the
        corpse. The only limitation is that the magic animating
        the body isn’t strong enough to hold disarticulated bones
        together, so there must be enough flesh remaining to
        actually move the corpse.&lt;br&gt;
        A ghost using this Charm may extend the duration by
        paying the activation cost again. His player may spend an
        experience point to make the possession permanent. This
        locks the ghost in the body, free of charge, until he chooses
        to leave. When he abandons it, it can never be inhabited
        again. As a corpse will decay to the point of uselessness in
        just a few weeks, most nemissaries are very hard on permanently
        possessed bodies. Ghosts who know this Arcanos
        and have access to their own corpse can possess it permanently
        without the cost of an experience point.

        The possession of the human form is easiest for the
        dead, as they were themselves once human. Yet, with
        refinement of their skills, the dead can also possess animals
        as well. This Arcanos allows a ghost to possess the corpse
        of any beast no larger than a wolf. It is most typically used
        on raitons, because they mummify naturally and can be
        made to fly even when long dead. The Deathlords use
        veritable legions of such spies. When in possession of an
        animal’s body, the ghost has all of its Physical Attributes
        but otherwise uses his own Traits. As with Nemissary’s
        Ride, the character’s player need only make a difficulty 1
        Strength + Compassion roll to effect the possession.

            This Arcanos is a type of Ox-Body Charm that works
            only on vessels the ghost is riding or possessing. While it
            doesn’t add anything to the ghost’s health levels, it dramatically
            fortifies all vessels she is skinriding using
            Mortal-Shadowing Technique, Nemissary’s Ride or subsequent
            Arcanoi in the tree. Some ghosts skinride mortal
            descendants to protect them in battle, while others augment
            possessed corpses to increase their own battlefield prowess.
            When a ghost departs the vessel she was riding, the extra
            health levels are crossed off, whether they held damage or
            not. Each purchase imparts one -0 and one -1 health level
            on the ghost’s vessel. A ghost can buy this Charm as many
            times as she has dots in her Compassion rating. Storytellers
            should note that a ghost’s own Ox-Body Technique does
            not fortify hosts, only her own plasm.
            This Arcanos is particularly helpful when the ghost is
            riding a smaller animal, such as a raiton, which usually has
            far fewer health levels than a human being.

            With this Arcanos, a nemissary refines her ability to
            possess and animate dead flesh. She may automatically
            commandeer a corpse as if using Nemissary’s Ride (see
            Exalted: The Abyssals, p. 250) but requires no roll to do
            so. Such possession lasts until the ghost withdraws the
            Essence committed to the Arcanos. Finally, a body possessed
            using the Embalmer’s Art does not decay. Any
            existing decay from prior to possession remains, and the
            body resumes decomposing normally if the ghost leaves it.
            Furthermore, the nemissary may fortify the vessel it’s
            riding with Essence. For every 4 additional motes of
            Essence the ghost commits to the vessel, it gains a -2 health
            level. The ghost can impart up to its Compassion rating in
            additional health levels on a vessel this way.
            Nemissaries wanting to develop their powers even
            further can purchase a superior version of this Arcanos
            called the Embalmer’s Enduring Triumph. This Arcanos
            functions exactly as The Embalmer’s Art, but requires
            Compassion •••, Essence •••• and the Embalmer’s Art
            as a prerequisite. However, the Embalmer’s Enduring
            Triumph costs only 10 motes and 1 Willpower to activate
            and 2 motes per -1 health level, and the Willpower cost is
            waived if the ghost is in a shadowland.

                &lt;br&gt;
                Among the most powerful — and sometimes most
                painful — Arcanoi used by nemissaries, Instauration of the
                Fleshly Vessel allows a ghost to repair damage to a body she
                is possessing, whether that damage was caused by rot or
                combat. Many ghosts dislike this Arcanos because of the pain
                it causes them, but it provides the nemissary with options for
                keeping a war body useful well beyond its usual duration.
                The first technique in this Arcanos repairs rotting
                damage. Every 4 motes of Essence the ghost channels into
                this Charm undoes all rotting damage sustained over the
                course of a single day. In most climates, an unprotected
                corpse will last from six to eight weeks before it becomes
                structurally compromised. At that point, the vessel loses
                two permanent health levels per day until it reaches zero
                health levels, at which point it is little more than a jumble
                of bones and necrotic goo.&lt;br&gt;
                A nemissary using this Arcanos can take control of a
                vessel that may have gone untended a bit too long and
                render it more habitable. Bodies rot at a different rate
                depending on the climate. In the extreme North and
                South, bodies are mummified by the cold or arid climates
                and last for several months before ceasing to function. In
                warm, humid climes, a corpse may last only a couple of
                weeks before falling into a putrescent gray mass, and a
                nemissary may need to use this Arcanos frequently to keep
                her vessel intact. The Storyteller determines how often
                this Arcanos needs to be used on a body to keep it in good
                repair. Repeated uses of this Charm on even extremely
                decayed flesh can, eventually, result in a body that looks as
                though it’s only moments past its final breath. Once the
                ghost has repaired a possessed body with this Arcanos, she
                may use the Embalmer’s Art to preserve the corpse’s
                improved state indefinitely.&lt;br&gt;
                The other use of this Charm heals damage taken by
                the nemissary’s vessel, but at the expense of her corpus. For
                1 mote of Essence per health level, the nemissary bleeds
                her own integrity into the vessel to restore it. She suffers
                one unsoakable level of damage per level regenerated, with
                the type of damage appropriate to the type healed. She may
                heal bashing or lethal injuries in any order. Ghosts with
                the Ox-Body Technique Arcanos (a Conviction Arcanos
                with no Prerequisites and an Essence and Conviction
                minimum of 1 that gives two -2 levels per purchase, up to
                a limit of the ghost’s Conviction rating — see the Exalted
                Players Guide, pp. 83-84) are far more capable of using
                this Charm than other ghosts.&lt;br&gt;
                This Charm cannot heal damage caused by fire, aggra-
                vated sources or magic specifically designed to inflict
                deleterious effects on the undead (such as that caused by
                the Zeniths’ anima flare or the Charms Solar Spike or
                Blazing Solar Bolt).

            &lt;br&gt;
            Nemissary’s Ride allows a ghost to possess and ani-
            mate a shell as large as a very large (eight feet tall, 400
            pound) human. To animate corpses larger than that (or
            the multiple connected corpses of some necromantic war
            machines), the ghost must know Drive the Necrotic Co-
            lossus. This Charm allows ghosts to animate the bodies of
            even the largest natural animals and war machines up to
            the size of a large temple. If the shell to be animated is larger
            than that (as the largest war machines and behemoth
            corpses are), then multiple nemissaries must work in
            concert to animate it.&lt;br&gt;
            Once the player spends the experience point, the
            character no longer has to commit Essence to the Charm.
            At that point, the nemissary stays inside the war machine
            she’s “piloting” until she decides to leave.&lt;br&gt;
            The 30 nemissaries that propel Mask of Winter’s
            Juggernaut do so through the use of this Charm.

        World-Bridging Meditation&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        Ghosts maintain links to the world they left be-
        hind, willingly or no. World-Bridging Meditation
        enables a ghost to check in on those things that still
        matter. While it does not provide tremendous detail, it
        does give enough information to allow the ghost to
        know the basics of what’s going on with his Fetters. For
        many of the dead, that’s enough.&lt;br&gt;
        To employ World-Bridging Meditation, the ghost
        requires a moment of peace and quiet in which to meditate.
        If the circumstances are noisy or disruptive, a
        Willpower roll is required. Once the ghost is calm enough
        to continue, the player announces what Fetter the ghost is
        attempting to sense. It must be a Fetter — otherwise, the
        connection won’t be strong enough to allow the ghost to
        peer through the veil of death. At that point, a Wits +
        Temperance roll is made. If it is successful, the ghost gets
        a sense of the current state of the object or person. What
        the ghost gets is nothing more than a general assessment —
        health, condition and not much more. If the person is dead
        (or the object has been destroyed) the ghost is instantly
        aware of it and feels a cold, hollow absence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Sometimes, a momentary glimpse isn’t enough. In
        these cases, the ghost wishes to establish a more permanent
        link. In that case, Death-Avoiding Monitor is a useful
        technique for letting the ghost remain constantly aware of
        the condition of an object. The Death-Avoiding Monitor
        lets the ghost know when the object — or person’s —
        condition changes. Such changes include — but are not
        limited to — injury, illness, death, falling in love and
        pregnancy, in the case of a person, or structural damage or
        destruction, in the case of an object. The sense of the object
        stays in the background and only intrudes when the ghost
        concentrates or when the monitored condition changes.
        The object does not need to be one of the ghost’s Fetters.&lt;br&gt;
        Establishing the Death-Avoiding Monitor requires a
        Perception + Temperance roll, difficulty 1. If the ghost
        wishes to extend the effect of the Death-Avoiding Monitor,
        his player can do so by extending an experience point. This
        allows the effect to carry over for a year and a day. Adding
        a second experience point makes the effect permanent.

        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Temperance: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: World-Bridging Meditation&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Extension of the Friendly Gaze allows a ghost to peer
        in on another ghost’s Fetters. By laying a hand on her
        fellow shade, the ghost can peer across the barrier between
        worlds to see how the Fetter is faring. This information is
        not magically shared with the target, which allows the
        ghost gathering it to use the power in a potentially unscrupulous
        manner.&lt;br&gt;
        The first step in the Extension of the Friendly Gaze is
        simple physical contact between the ghost and her peer. If
        the other ghost is willing, this is automatic. If not, it
        requires a successful Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack, which need do no damage. Once physical contact,
        be it ever so brief, has been established, the player of the
        ghost attempting to use this Arcanos makes a reflexive
        Wits + Mediation roll at a difficulty of (5 - the Fetter rating
        of the object). If successful, the ghost gets the same sort of
        information about one of the target’s Fetters that she
        would have gotten from using World-Bridging Meditation
        for herself. If the target is not consenting, the Storyteller
        chooses the object or individual the ghost learns about.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY&lt;br&gt;
        There is no way for a ghost to know if her
        counterpart also has the ability to perform Ex-
        tension of the Friendly Gaze. If a ghost uses the
        power on a ghost who also possesses it, that ghost
        may, in turn, use it, reflexively and simultaneously,
        on his assailant.

        Prerequisite Charms: Extension of the Friendly Gaze&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        With Veil-Piercing Binding, a ghost can do for others
        what Death-Avoiding Monitor allows him to do for himself.
        This Arcanos binds an object or person in the lands of
        the living to the consciousness of a ghost, allowing her to
        perform a check on its status whenever she wants.&lt;br&gt;
        Veil-Piercing Binding must be invoked the turn after
        Extension of the Friendly Gaze. The ghost’s player makes an
        Endurance + Meditation roll (difficulty 2). If it succeeds, the
        Fetter the ghost saw with Extension of the Friendly Gaze is
        bound to the target. As with Death-Avoiding Monitor, the
        target must spend a point of Essence each time she wishes to
        check in on her bound Fetter. Veil-Piercing Binding can
        only bind one object or person at a time, but it can be used
        more than once on an individual ghost.&lt;br&gt;
        The duration of Veil-Piercing Binding can be extended
        by the expenditure of experience points. One
        experience point prolongs the effect for a year; two makes
        it permanent.

        Prerequisite Charms: Death-Avoiding Monitor&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Mark of the Relentless Hunter allows a ghost to
        not only know the rough condition of a Fetter, but also to
        sense its location and direction. While Mark of the Relentless
        Hunter is in effect, the ghost can effortlessly sense
        the Fetter and, thus, can track it even across the worlds.
        The connection, once forged, is unbreakable by any natural
        means, and the ghost’s sense of his Fetter is unshakable.
        Only the end of the Arcanos’ duration or the destruction
        of the item will serve to break the connection naturally.
        The Mark of the Relentless Hunter can also be set on
        an item or person bound to a ghost through either Death-Avoiding
        Monitor or Veil-Piercing Binding. The object
        must be specified before the Essence and Willpower is
        spent, at which point the player of the ghost activating the
        Arcanos makes a Perception + Meditation roll (difficulty
        2 if it’s being performed on another ghost, difficulty 1 if the
        ghost is performing it on herself). If the roll is successful,
        the ghost now has a fix on the item and can summon up its
        condition and direction without expenditure of Essence.
        Expending 1 experience point can extend the Mark
        out to a year. A second experience point makes the sign
        permanent. Characters who have this Charm’s effects
        binding them to an object can develop Fetters relating to
        it more easily and cheaply. See Chapter Seven: Storytelling
        for details. If another ghost is the beneficiary of this
        Arcanos, his player must spend the experience points.
        Essence committed to the Charm is released when it is
        made permanent with experience.&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        THE ETERNAL HUNT&lt;br&gt;
        Once the Mark of the Relentless Hunter has
        been made permanent, even death cannot exert
        power over it. A ghost can find a loved one or a hated
        enemy who passes into the Underworld by virtue of
        a Mark placed during life.

        Sensing the Delicate Strands allows a ghost to get a
        mental image of the things that are important to another
        ghost. It is also a key step in performing Chain-Shattering
        Discipline, illuminating a target who would otherwise
        be unknowable.&lt;br&gt;
        Using the Arcanos does not require physical contact.
        Instead, the ghost must only be within sight of her target.
        Once the object of her attentions has been picked out, the
        ghost’s player makes a Perception + Occult roll (difficulty
        3). A success gives the ghost basic knowledge of one of the
        target’s Fetters. The character knows the distance to, the
        direction of, the appearance of and the general nature of
        the subject’s attachment to the Fetter. At no additional
        cost, the ghost’s player can keep rolling until she fails. Each
        success reveals another secret.&lt;br&gt;
        If an attempt at Sensing the Delicate Strands fails, 24
        hours must elapse before the ghost can make another
        attempt on the same target. A ghost whose mind has been
        read thus is not aware that Sensing the Delicate Strands
        has been used on him, regardless of whether the attempt
        succeeds or fails.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Chain-Shattering Discipline is the inverse of powers
        such as Veil-Piercing Binding. Instead of binding a ghost to
        a Fetter, this Arcanos instead shatters that bond. Once the
        ghost has identified a target, she can choose to break the
        ghost’s connection to it. Once the connection is broken, the
        Fetter is gone. It and its representation no longer provide
        any benefits, nor can the ghost nor any other ghosts spy on
        it with Arcanoi for sensing or locating Fetters. The connection
        is lost, irretrievably and irrevocably.&lt;br&gt;
        The use of Chain-Shattering Discipline requires either
        visual contact with the target and a successful use of
        Sensing the Delicate Strands or possession of something
        belonging to the target, which is broken when the Charm
        is activated. A Strength + Temperance roll with difficulty
        equal to the target’s permanent Essence plus the strength
        of the Fetter is required to actually break the link.
        The target is instantly aware of the breaking of the
        link, even if there was no active connection between the
        two at the time. The victim’s player must also succeed on
        a Willpower roll, or his character goes mad for a number of
        days equal to the attacker’s Temperance rating.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Any ghost who can touch another’s Fetters is painfully
        aware that someone may be doing the same thing to them.
        This knowledge made the development of Weaver Guards
        the Loom — the most basic defense against this sort of
        aggression — a necessity. By exercising Weaver Guards the
        Loom, the ghost gathers the threads of his Fetters, so as to
        know when another hand is touching them.&lt;br&gt;
        Activating Weaver Guards the Loom requires an
        Intelligence + Meditation roll (difficulty 1). If successful,
        the ghost is now automatically protected against Fetter-
        related intrusion. He need not think about it and can
        reflexively renew the protection when its duration lapses.&lt;br&gt;
        While Weaver Guards the Loom is in effect, the
        ghost’s player gets a reflexive Perception + Temperance
        roll (difficulty 1) in the instance of any attempt to use any
        Fetter monitoring or detection Charm against the ghost. If
        the action is detected, the ghost’s player can make a
        reflexive Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 3) to see if his
        character has an idea where the intrusion comes from.
        Success on this roll reveals the identity of the interloper.
        Weaver Guards the Loom does not prevent the intrusion.
        It merely reports the fact to the ghost whose Fetters are
        being violated. There is no way for the intruding ghost to
        know she has been detected.

        Weaver Guards the Loom provides awareness of intrusion.
        Farmer Defends the Unharvested Field allows the
        ghost to strike back. A supplement to its predecessor,
        Farmer Defends the Unharvested Field is generally invoked
        whenever Weaver Guards the Loom detects
        tampering with the character’s Fetters. As soon as the
        latter Charm detects an unwelcome intrusion of this sort,
        the ghost’s power strikes back invisibly. On a successful
        Wits + Mediation (difficulty 1) roll by the player of the
        ghost using this Charm, the offending party suddenly
        suffers sharp pain, akin to being struck with a glass-studded
        whip. This does 5L damage, soaked only with natural soak.
        The intruding ghost loses her concentration, the attempt
        she made automatically fails, and her identity is immediately
        known to her target. While the blow is strictly
        psychic, it does have a physical manifestation — the affect
        ghost bleeds from her sensory organs for several minutes.&lt;br&gt;
        While Farmer Defends the Unharvested Field is reflexive,
        a ghost can choose not to unleash it. The cost of
        the Arcanos is paid each time it is used, but there is no cost
        if the ghost refrains from using it. Farmer Defends the
        Unharvested Field can specifically preempt Chain-Shattering
        Discipline.

        This Charm allows a ghost’s whispered voice to be
        heard in the portion of the living world that corresponds
        to his location in the Underworld. The ghost must literally
        whisper as he uses this ability — if he speaks at normal
        volume, those near him in the lands of the dead hear him
        normally, but those in the living world do not. The ghost’s
        whispers can be heard clearly within one yard of his
        location. A successful Perception + Awareness roll must
        be made for those within 10 yards to hear the whispers, and
        an additional success must be achieved for every 10 yards
        distance for anyone further away.

        Marsh Light allows a ghost to create a light or a small
        group of lights in the living world in the spot correspond-
        ing to her current location in the Underworld. The light
        or lights must form simple shapes and can only move with
        the ghost.&lt;br&gt;
        The lights often pique the curiosity of the living.
        Players of living creatures who see the lights and aren’t
        actively engaged in something they consider to be important
        (combat, critical craftwork, healing a friend, etc.)
        must make a successful Conviction roll for their characters,
        or they spend a turn considering the lights. Living
        creatures or spirits with an Essence higher than the ghost’s
        are immune to this effect.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Sweet Winsome Light creates a beautiful bobbing
        light that attracts all who see it. Ghosts use this Arcanos
        to lure their prey — or their enemies — to their doom. The
        light dances in the wind, eternally just five or ten yards out
        of reach, and it appears to be a traveler’s torch or a glowing
        talisman. The Sweet Winsome Light can be created within
        20 yards of the ghost’s current location or (for an additional
        mote of Essence) at the spot in Creation
        corresponding to the ghost’s current location in the Underworld.
        To create the light, the ghost’s player rolls
        Charisma + Occult, and it lasts for one minute per success.&lt;br&gt;
        The light attracts all who see it. Animals that notice
        it automatically move toward it (though they don’t charge
        with all their will — their handlers or riders may resist the
        Arcanos with standard Ride feats if they can keep their
        own heads about them). Living beings (even Exalted)
        resist the Sweet Winsome Light with a Conviction roll.
        For each turn that the light is visible, the target’s player
        must get at least one success on the Conviction roll, or the
        target moves toward it at his best possible speed. A spent
        point of Willpower negates the effect of the Sweet Winsome
        Light for a full minute.

        A ghost using Tinker’s Body can assemble a patch-
        work body for himself in the living world out of nearby
        scraps, trash and trinkets. The ghost remains intangible
        but is able to motivate the collection of objects and feel
        through the Tinker’s Body as though it was his own flesh
        and blood — at least to some extent. The ghost cannot
        speak through the Tinker’s Body, though he can clap,
        stomp and make similar gross-motor sorts of sounds. The
        ghost loses two dice from all Social dice pools while
        “wearing” the Tinker’s Body — a penalty that may be
        reduced if the ghost’s player succeeds in an appropriate
        Craft roll for his character to fabricate a suitably expressive
        face. The ghost’s Mental Attributes are unchanged in the
        Tinker’s Body, while his Physical Attributes depend on
        the composition of the body.&lt;br&gt;
        The Tinker’s Body gets one dot in each of the three
        Physical Attributes, and the ghost gets an additional four
        dots to be split between the Physical Attributes based on the
        objects out of which he constructs the Tinker’s Body — a
        Tinker’s Body made of twine and straw may have a Dexterity
        of ••••• and Strength and Stamina of • each, while one
        made of loose brick and stone may have a Dexterity of • and
        Strength and Stamina of ••• each. The Tinker’s Body is
        only a shell; it has four health levels (-0/-1/-2/-4). Wound
        penalties represent bits of the body being knocked off or
        otherwise destroyed, rather than pain and shock.

        Sleeper’s Caul enables a ghost to make a static solid
        body in the land of the living. This body is not truly the
        ghost’s own body; it is a shell, and even if it is destroyed, the
        ghost remains unharmed. The Sleeper’s Caul has a Strength
        and Dexterity of 0; it cannot move. Its Stamina is equal to
        the ghost’s Stamina. The Sleeper’s Caul can hear, speak
        and see (even blink and move its eyes). The ghost has a
        sense of touch, even if it cannot move, so it does feel pain.
        The Sleeper’s Caul has three health levels (no wound
        penalties apply, since the body can never perform actions).

        Embody allows a ghost who is disembodied in the
        material world to create himself a temporary body out of
        Essence. This body takes the ghost’s likeness (which may
        not be exactly the same as his appearance in life!). The
        meat-body that the ghost pulls together with Embody is
        not a fully functional body by comparison to the ghost’s
        normal abilities in the Underworld, a shadowland or
        during Calibration. The ghost has its normal Intelligence,
        Wits and Social Attributes while in this temporary body,
        but as an improvised bag of flesh, its other Attributes are
        all reduced by two dots (to minimum of •). The meat-body
        has four health levels (-0/-1/-2/-4), and the ghost really
        does feel the pain of any wounds it takes — and it is
        obviously not well suited for combat.

        animals of its species will recognize it to be strange and shy
        away from it. The ghost animal returns to incorporeal

        if the ghost using this Arcanos ends his manifestation
        before the end of the scene.

        Birth the Warrior Form allows the ghost to use his
        Essence and Willpower to create a body that is prepared for
        combat — the ghost also creates temporary armor and
        weapons that manifest in the living world. The player
        should roll Valor + Occult to create the body, and for each
        success, the Warrior Form lasts for five minutes. This body
        takes the ghost’s likeness and has his full Attributes. The
        Warrior Form also has the ghost’s full health levels. Additionally,
        the ghost may fabricate any single nonmagical
        weapon and single nonmagical set of armor, each of whose
        Resources cost is less than or equal to his Essence. For
        instance, if the ghost’s Essence is 3, he may create a great
        sword and a chain hauberk, but not plate-and-chain. The
        ghost may dissolve the Warrior Form at any time before the
        end of the Charm’s rolled duration, in which case, the
        Warrior Form is considered to have ended. When the
        Charm ends, the armor and weapon created by it dissolve
        along with the Warrior Form.

        Ghosts exist outside of the formal strictures of Creation.
        The body that a ghost creates for himself does not
        have to match the characteristics of his dead flesh, if he
        knows Birth the Perfected Master. Birth the Perfected
        Master creates a meat-body like Embody, except that it has
        the ghost’s full Ability scores. The flesh that Birth the
        Perfected Master creates reflects the ghost’s idealized self-image.
        The ghost may split six dots among the following
        Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina and Appearance.
        This body is created stark naked, and it lasts for five
        minutes for each success that the player achieves on a
        Valor + Occult roll.

        The ghost experiences his first birth in Creation, and
        his second birth comes when he enters the Underworld as
        one of the Restless Dead. This Arcanos allows the ghost to
        flicker back and forth between living and ghostly forms.
        Use of this Charm does not permit a ghost to take on a flesh
        form — in order to do that, he must use Materialize,
        Weighted With the Anchor of Flesh (see Exalted: The
        Abyssals) or one of the other Arcanoi in this tree. However,
        once manifest in a physical form, Unending Rebirth
        allows him to switch from immaterial to physical and back.
        The ghost can only activate this Charm once he is manifested,
        and it requires a Wits + Occult roll. If that roll
        succeeds, he may change back and forth from manifest to
        immaterial as he wishes until the duration of Unending
        Rebirth (or his manifestation Charm) expires. Each switch
        from flesh to ghost or back requires 1 mote of Essence and
        is a simple action. A “switch” of this nature does not
        terminate a manifestation Arcanos.
        For Example: The long-dead Master Cotep, manifest
        to visit his namesake in a village in the South, finds himself
        surrounded by angry villagers. He is already manifest in
        Creation. Cotep spends 8 motes and 1 Willpower (and his
        player rolls Wits + Occult) to activate Unending Rebirth,
        and he becomes immaterial. He runs through the wall of
        his namesake’s hut and past his foes. The next turn, he
        spends another mote to rematerialize and fight on his own
        terms. A few turns later, things are going badly, so he
        spends another mote to dematerialize and run for safety.

        Conjure the Defeated Vessel allows a ghost to bring a
        single ship, regardless of size, from the Underworld into
        Creation. Ordinarily, a ship crossing into Creation from a
        shadowland becomes intangible, just as ghosts do. Conjure
        the Defeated Vessel is used once the ship has entered the
        physical realm, and it makes the boat fully physical. The
        ghost’s player must roll Intelligence + Sail, and the boat
        remains fully physical for one hour per success. The ghost
        may spend additional Essence and his player reroll the
        Charm’s duration at any time — the duration of Conjure
        the Defeated Vessel is measured from that point onward
        and uses the new roll (in other words, if the Arcanos still
        has three hours duration left to it and the ghost spends 5
        motes of Essence and his player rerolls, getting four successes,
        the boat will stay physical for another four hours,
        not seven). Essence spent activating this Charm is committed
        until the effect’s duration expires, so ghosts will be
        drained of Essence if they attempt to maintain it overlong.&lt;br&gt;
        The ship’s Traits are all just as they would be in the
        Underworld (in other words, the same as any other boat of
        the same type and materials in Creation). It is considered
        to be intact (despite any appearances to the contrary) and
        has all its health levels (unless it suffers from unrepaired
        damage from the Underworld, in which case, it retains that
        damage). Once so manifested, the boat remains physical
        until its pilot or the ghost using this Arcanos becomes
        incorporeal again. The boat is blasted to ash and dust by
        direct sunlight (though if it stays in caves, travels only
        when it’s overcast or is shrouded by fog, it can survive until
        the Charm’s duration expires).

        of his Essence. The ghost’s player rolls Manipulation +
        Sail, and the ghost spends his Essence. For every success,
        the fleet can remain in Creation for one hour. As with
        Conjure the Defeated Vessel, each boat retains its full
        Traits in Creation. Its weapons work normally, and its hull
        is considered to be whole even if it has massive ancient
        rents in its side.

        This simple art allows an incorporeal ghost in the
        material world to sneak words out through the mouth of a
        living person. The ghost must “touch” the target and spends
        a mote of Essence, and his player rolls the ghost’s Dexterity +
        Expression. If he succeeds, the target involuntarily says what
        the ghost intended him to say — one word for every success
        achieved. The target does not immediately realize that she is
        speaking at all, but she can figure it out by her player
        succeeding at an Intelligence + Occult roll after someone
        around the character points out that she said words she
        doesn’t remember speaking. A conscious target who is aware
        that a ghost is manipulating her can resist such manipulation
        for the scene by spending a Willpower. If the target wishes to
        allow the ghost to speak through her, the ghost must spend 1
        mote of Essence per sentence but no roll needs to be made.

        Throughout the Underworld, subtle laws apply to the
        activities of ghosts. Most such laws stem from the use of
        ancient and wide-ranging necromancy, but others are
        restricted in their area of effect, are new or have nothing
        to do with necromancy itself — they are inherent to the
        fabric of the Underworld. Ghosts can create temporary
        taboos with the Impose Stricture Arcanos (see p. 45).
        Illuminate the Shadow Constraint reveals any taboos
        that apply to any locations within sight. Alternately, the
        ghost’s player may roll Perception + Bureaucracy when her
        character uses this Charm in order to determine any taboos
        that apply to a particular person or ghost. Studious and
        careful ghosts learn Illuminate the Shadow Constraint in
        order to remain aware of taboos and strange laws of reality
        as they travel from realm to realm.&lt;br&gt;

        TWENTY TABOOS&lt;br&gt;
        The Storyteller may use any of these as local taboos, while players may choose to create them with
        necromancy or some of the Arcanoi in this art. This list should be seen only as inspiration. These are not the only
        possible taboos by any means.&lt;br&gt;
        • The living may not eat food grown in this place (or they may not eat a particular food, such as pomegranates).&lt;br&gt;
        • Slay no ghost animals.&lt;br&gt;
        • Do not say the word “love.”&lt;br&gt;
        • Touch no other ghost.&lt;br&gt;
        • Never let your feet touch the ground.&lt;br&gt;
        • Look at no other ghost’s eyes.&lt;br&gt;
        • Do not speak of Creation or of your mortal life.&lt;br&gt;
        • Wear no woven clothing.&lt;br&gt;
        • Never speak your name.&lt;br&gt;

        • Do not fight with thrown weapons.&lt;br&gt;
        • Carry a piece of stone against your flesh at all times.&lt;br&gt;
        • Speak only in whispers.&lt;br&gt;
        • Eat only the flesh of carrion eaters such as hyenas or vultures.&lt;br&gt;

        A ghost who activates Dark Sorcery Observation
        instantly notices the presence of any active necromantic
        effects within his field of vision, so long as his player
        succeeds in a simple Perception + Occult roll. Ensorcelled
        people, objects or areas emit a dark, pulsing aura to the
        character’s eyes for a moment or two. With three or more
        successes, the ghost is aware of the circle (Shadowlands,
        Underworld, Void) of the necromancy, and with five or
        more successes, he learns a one-word description of what
        every effect in the area is doing.

        This simple Charm allows a ghost to detect the
        presence of criminals against the local natural order. It
        immediately points out any living being in line of sight
        within the Underworld (even if he attempts to conceal his
        presence through non-magical disguises or the like). Additionally,
        with a Perception + Bureaucracy roll at standard
        difficulty, the ghost-magistrate notices any entity that has
        violated a taboo of the Underworld within the last 24
        hours and not had his violation forgiven through the use
        of Accept Amercement.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Brief Exemption allows a ghost to tiptoe around a
        taboo of the Underworld, whether it is a “natural” taboo,
        one imposed by necromancy or one created by Impose
        Stricture (see p. 45). A Manipulation + Stealth roll is
        required. An “ordinary” natural taboo requires just one
        success to ignore. One imposed by Necromancy or Impose
        Stricture requires a number of successes equal to the
        Essence of the entity who created the taboo (a default of
        four if unknown).

        &lt;br&gt;
        Accept Amercement allows a learned ghost to forgive
        another’s trespass of local taboo. The violator does not
        have to be truly repentant; the Charm simply eliminates
        the negative effect of the taboo for the scene. If the taboo
        act is a simple, instant thing — eating pomegranates, for
        instance — this Charm “erases” the act, and the target of
        the Charm will suffer no further ill effects from his past
        violation. If the taboo is a state of being — for instance,
        wearing shoes when it is forbidden to do so — the Arcanos
        allows the target to continue to violate the taboo for the
        duration of a single scene.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The intensity of punishment for violating a taboo varies
        wildly. This Arcanos allows a ghostly magistrate to add his
        own penalty to a violation. This additional punishment can
        take one of several forms, at the magistrate’s discretion:&lt;br&gt;
        • -2 dice to all dice pools&lt;br&gt;
        • A visible or audible sign that the violator is a
        criminal (such as a brand or a phantom crow that shouts
        “Violator!” from the character’s shoulder)&lt;br&gt;
        • All forms of movement reduced by 1/3 due to some
        visible impediment&lt;br&gt;
        Similarly scaled punishments may also be levied, at
        the Storyteller’s discretion. All such effects last until the
        end of the scene in which Levy Fine is invoked but require
        no dice roll to impose so long as the target of the Charm has
        violated a local taboo. No punishment can be used if the
        target has not violated a local taboo. This Charm may be
        applied multiple times to a single target, but only if he has
        violated multiple laws of the Underworld.

        world or a shadowland until such time as he is forgiven for
        his transgression. This forgiveness can only come from
        the use of Accept Amercement (above) by a ghost with
        equal to or higher Essence than the ghost who uses this
        Arcanos. This Arcanos has no effect on ghosts, nor even
        on Ghost-Blooded.

        Prerequisite Charms: House Arrest&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Hide the Living Name turns a living transgressor into
        a ghost for all intents and purposes until his crime is
        forgiven by a ghostly magistrate with equal or higher
        Essence than the user of this Arcanos. The Charm strips
        away the subject’s physical form and life-essence, impris-
        oning it in an unknown location (many suspect the
        Labyrinth — which might have dire consequences in the
        long run, see below). What’s left, the target’s higher soul
        (or hun), persists as any other ghost might. The subject of
        the Charm can leave the Underworld through a shadowland
        and even enter Creation, but no matter where he goes, he
        remains a ghost (and is incorporeal in Creation, etc.). His
        physical body does, apparently, age — a few centuries ago,
        in a rare case, a mortal was stricken to ghosthood by a
        vengeful magistrate and left in that state for several years.
        When he returned to a living state, he found that his hair
        had grayed and that lines had crept across his face.&lt;br&gt;
        Living targets of this Charm with particularly high
        scores in any Virtue and low Willpower may find that their
        bodies become possessed by spectres while they are under
        the influence of this Arcanos. Spectres are attracted to the
        bodies of the particularly virtuous (regardless of the Vir-
        tue), but are repelled by the leftover Willpower that
        anchors the living body’s mind. If the sum of the character’s
        two highest Virtues exceed his Willpower, that character’s
        body is a potential possession target. A possessing spectre
        takes a living body back into Creation and wreaks havoc
        as it sees fit. It cannot read the victim’s mind, so it cannot
        necessarily destroy the character’s life, but it can certainly
        break laws and cause trouble no matter where it goes. If a
        possessed body is killed in Creation, it returns to the
        Labyrinth and slowly regenerates, and the spectre that
        took it to Creation is ejected.&lt;br&gt;
        If the character’s body is possessed at the time that his
        sentence ends, he cannot return to it until the spectre
        residing in it is somehow ejected. It is the Storyteller’s call
        as to whether the target’s body has been possessed at all and
        particularly whether the body is “out” at the time that the
        target is ready to return to it.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The ghost using Impose Stricture can create a short-
        term taboo in his local area — within one mile per point
        of permanent Essence (or the size of a small village). This
        taboo should be relatively simple — nearly all taboos
        either preclude a single simple behavior (such as eating
        pomegranates) or require a single behavior (such as wear-
        ing a particular garment at all times). No taboo can be
        impossible to adhere to — even taboos that are logical
        impossibilities (“Everyone in this area must be male and
        female at the same time”) has to have a possible symbolic
        solution (ritual transvestitism, for instance). Taboos created
        by Impose Stricture only apply within the Underworld.
        Impose Stricture implies only a single, relatively minor
        penalty — violators of a taboo suffer a one-die penalty to
        all dice pools until one hour past the time that they stop
        violating the taboo. That is, if the taboo is a single action,
        violators suffer a one-hour penalty. If it is a continuous
        action (“Wear no leather”), the penalty applies as long as
        the criminal violates the taboo and then an additional
        hour after that. The one-hour duration can be cut short if
        the violator receives the use of Accept Amercement by a
        ghost magistrate.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A magistrate-ghost uses Curse of the Damned to
        apply a permanent taboo to another being — be it a spirit,
        a ghost or a living being. The target of this Arcanos must
        have an Essence lower than the ghost using it, and it is
        difficult to apply — the ghost’s player makes a Manipulation
        + Lore roll, while the target’s player resists with
        Willpower. If the ghost achieves more successes, the
        target suffers from a taboo for the rest of its existence. As
        with Impose Stricture, above, violation of the taboo
        results in a one-die penalty to all dice pools for at least
        one hour after the violation. The taboo should be straightforward,
        as described in Impose Stricture (with examples
        given in the boxed text on p. 43). The Curse of the
        Damned can be removed if the ghost who inflicted it uses
        Accept Amercement or if any other entity with an
        Essence higher than the ghostly magistrate who invoked
        the taboo uses Accept Amercement.

        With this Arcanos, a ghost can send a message to a
        living being through dreams. The ghost can perform this
        Charm from the Underworld, a shadowland or Creation,
        and send the message to a subject anywhere in Creation.
        The message travels instantaneously to the subject’s cur-
        rent location. However, the subject does not receive the
        message until the next time he sleeps (and if that is more
        than eight hours away, the subject does not receive the
        message at all). The ghost may speak up to 50 words to the
        subject, who sees the Charm’s effect as the ghost standing
        and speaking the words to him. This Arcanos does not
        allow for two-way communication — the subject receives
        the ghost’s message but may not send a reply.

        A ghost can use this Arcanos to send a minor blessing to

        speaks the descendant’s name aloud, pictures him and spends
        the necessary Essence, and the subject of the Charm immediately
        receives a three-dice bonus pool that can be used to
        supplement any action at any time in the next day. As the
        Arcanos takes effect, the subject feels a pleasant surge of
        energy and good fortune. These dice can only be used once —
        after the subject of the Charm uses the bonus dice, they are
        gone. This Charm only works on living mortals and Exalts
        who can trace a line of blood descent from the ghost.

        mortals and Exalts who trace a line of blood descent from
        the ghost. It works at any range, however. The ghost must
        simply visualize the target and state his name aloud, and
        the subject feels a dull, throbbing pain throughout the
        duration of the Charm. While the curse is active, the
        subject loses one die from all dice pools. Spend the necessary
        Essence, and roll Compassion + Lore. For every
        success, the curse lasts one hour. The ghost who activates
        the Arcanos may dismiss the curse at any time.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The ghost scholar who knows Discerning Student
        Technique has whole libraries of information buried within
        his ghostly mind, and he can easily compare the known
        facts of a situation against the statements of another being.
        The ghost’s player rolls Perception + Empathy as the ghost
        activates this Arcanos. Throughout the duration, he gains
        one automatic success to detect most falsehoods. Discerning
        Student Technique provides insight (that automatic
        success) into statements that the speaker knows to be lies.
        It also provides the same level of insight when a speaker
        misstates objective fact, so long as that objective fact is
        recorded in a public, scholarly storehouse of knowledge
        located in the Underworld (it would prove to be of no use
        if a scholar’s allies began saying “…the Scarlet Empress is
        in Sijan! …the Scarlet Empress is in Chiaroscuro! …the
        Scarlet Empress is in Wangler’s Knob!” until they found
        one statement that did not register as false — it only works
        on matters of scholarly record). This Charm does not
        provide the ghost with insight into the truth of a situation
        in any circumstances, only awareness of whether a statement
        is false.

        The ghost-scholar using Masterly Pedagogical Inquiry
        can force his subject to answer a single question
        truthfully. The ghost simply spends the necessary Essence
        and asks a direct question of the target, and the ghost’s
        player rolls Manipulation + Presence; the target’s player
        rolls Willpower to resist. If the ghost achieves more successes
        than the target, the target must answer the question
        as fully and truthfully as possible — though generally
        speaking, this Arcanos cannot get more than a 100-word
        answer out of anyone with a single question. This Charm
        does not work on individuals with an Essence higher than
        the ghost’s.

        Prerequisite Charms: Masterly Pedagogical Inquiry&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Imperious Instructor’s Dictate allows a ghost to issue
        a single command to her subject, which must be followed
        to the best of the subject’s ability. The scholar spends her
        Essence and Willpower and immediately issues a single
        command, a short imperative sentence. The ghost’s player
        rolls Charisma + Presence, and the target’s player rolls
        Willpower to resist. If the ghost achieves more successes
        than the target, the target will obey the command — and
        not realize that he’s been given a command, but rather,
        think that this is his own idea. The target loses interest in
        fulfilling the command after about a day, so the ghost using
        this Arcanos should make the command relatively easy to
        accomplish within that period. If the ghost’s player manages
        to botch the roll on this Charm, the target instantly
        knows that he is being magically manipulated and is likely
        to respond angrily. This Charm does not work on individuals
        with an Essence higher than the ghost’s.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The ghost with this Charm manipulates another
        ghost’s hun, rendering that ghost friendly to the Arcanos’
        user. This ability, unlike most of the previous Arcanoi in
        this art, works only on ghosts. Typically, the Charm
        induces the sort of camaraderie seen between a skilled
        student and a wise instructor (the ghost using this Arcanos
        may choose to impose either role on the target). The target
        of the Arcanos generally can’t be forced to act in contradiction
        to his Nature or strongly held Virtues. He also
        won’t sacrifice his unlife or livelihood for the ghost, but he
        will do his best to assist the ghost as much as possible.
        The ghost cannot use this Arcanos on another ghost
        with a higher Essence than hers. The player of the ghost
        using Favored-Student Charm makes a Charisma + Socialize
        roll, after the ghost spends her Essence and
        Willpower, and the target may resist with Willpower. A
        botch on the roll to activate this Arcanos immediately
        reveals the ghost’s intentions to the target, probably with
        dire consequences. When the Arcanos wears off, if it is not
        renewed with the expenditure of more Essence and Willpower,
        the target will have a vague idea of what was done
        to him and may feel somewhat uneasy around the user (+1
        difficulty to all Social rolls between target and user). The
        number of net successes determines the duration:&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Successes Duration&lt;br&gt;
        1 One hour&lt;br&gt;

        5 One month&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not work on individuals with an Essence
        higher than the ghost’s.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The wise ghost-scholar can manipulate a student’s
        hun sufficiently to permanently implant an order in another
        ghost’s mind. Like Favored-Student Charm, Eternally
        Loyal Student Prana can be used only on other ghosts,
        rather than the living or other spirits. The scholar must
        first spend a full day with the target. At the end of this time,
        he spends the Essence and Willpower to insert the command
        into the target’s mind. The ghost cannot use this
        Charm on a ghost with an Essence higher than his own.
        The Arcanos requires a roll of Manipulation + Presence,
        and the target’s player may resist with a Willpower roll.
        The scholar’s player must achieve at least two net successes
        on his roll. The orders cannot be more complex than about
        100 words’ worth unless the ghost achieves five or more net
        successes (in which case, they can be as complex as he
        wishes, down to subclauses and special cases). As with
        Favored-Student Charm, no orders may be implanted that
        directly contradict the target’s Nature or high Virtues.

        The ghost with this Arcanos needs only for her player
        to successfully roll Perception + Craft to gain insight about
        the origins of a piece of soulsteel or a soulsteel artifact. For
        every success, the ghost can ask one simple, straightforward
        question about the physical details of previous handlers
        of an item or events for which the object was present or
        used. These events can predate the item’s destruction in
        Creation, if the object is in fact an echo of Creation.

        Soulsteel Shaper allows a ghostly artisan to aid in the
        creation of soulsteel items. With Soulsteel Shaper, a ghost
        can serve as a “trained thaumaturge” for the purposes of
        assisting an Exalt or other master craftsman in creating a
        soulsteel artifact, even if he lacks the necessary levels of
        Craft, Lore and Occult. See Savant and Sorcerer, Chapter
        Two, for details on assistants and crafting. Activation of
        this Arcanos simply allows the ghost to serve in this role
        during its duration on soulsteel projects. It does not enable
        him to assist with artifacts crafted from other substances.

        As the ghost artisan approaches master status, he
        gains the ability to modify relics that echo into the deadlands
        from the living world as part of a character’s Grave Goods
        Background. With this Arcanos, a ghost artisan can (slowly)
        transform a grave good into another form without changing
        its nature or magical Traits. The artisan cannot remove
        more than about 10 percent of the grave good’s mass if he
        wants it to retain any magical properties, nor can he add
        more than about 10 percent in new materials. For example,
        the artisan might transform a relic sword into a shield or a
        group of steel mugs. The transformed item remains composed
        of the same materials — a transformed sword remains
        mostly steel, a transformed chair mostly wood. If the relic
        is transformed into a group of items, those items only retain
        any magical properties when they are together. It takes
        seven days per dot of the Grave Goods Background to
        modify a relic in this fashion, which means that a ghost
        who wishes to change any potent grave good must be
        prepared to spend a great deal of Essence to do so.

        &lt;br&gt;
        As the ghost artisan approaches master status, he gains
        the ability to modify soulsteel artifacts. With this Arcanos,
        a ghost artisan can (slowly) transform an artifact made
        mostly or entirely of soulsteel into another form without
        changing its nature or magical Traits. The artisan cannot
        remove more than about 10 percent of the artifact’s mass if
        he wants it to retain its magical properties, nor can he add
        more than about 10 percent in new materials. The artisan
        might transform a soulsteel suit of armor into a different sort
        of armor, for example, or a mated pair of swords.&lt;br&gt;
        Essentially, any purely physical transformation can be
        made that does not alter the item’s various artifact sub-ratings,
        such as Usefulness, Game Impact or Script
        Immunity, as per Savant and Sorcerer, Chapter Two. It is
        possible that the Storyteller will allow changes to the
        item’s Usefulness or Game Impact through this Charm,
        but changes to the item’s Power, Script Immunity and
        Essence Drawback are explicitly forbidden. If a single
        artifact is transformed into a group of items, those items
        only retain their magical properties when they are together.
        It takes seven days per dot of the Artifact Background
        to modify a soulsteel artifact in this fashion, which means
        that a ghost who wishes to change any potent artifact must
        be prepared to spend a great deal of Essence to do so.

        Given a quantity of raw soulsteel, a ghost-artisan with
        this Charm may help to forge it into a new artifact. Such
        an artifact lacks magical Traits beyond the standard abilities
        conveyed by soulsteel as a Magical Material (in the
        hands of an Abyssal Exalt, a soulsteel melee weapon gets
        +1 accuracy and drains Essence from the target when
        damage is done, while soulsteel armor gets +2 soak when
        attuned by an Abyssal, and so on — see Exalted, Chapter
        Nine, for details). Creation of the soulsteel item takes as
        long as it would take to craft an item out of ordinary steel
        in Creation, but this Arcanos must be activated every day
        in order to do so.

        Unlike Careful Debtor Stance, Bold Thief’s Way
        enables a ghost-thief or unethical ghost-merchant to
        steal Essence from an unwilling target. Any time the
        ghost comes into contact with another entity (ghost,
        god, mortal or Exalt) he may reflexively take Essence
        from them by spending 3 motes and his player rolling
        Conviction + Larceny. The ghost takes 1 mote for every
        success on this roll (so unless his intention is simply to
        drain the target of Essence, he had better get at least three
        successes). The ghost may not use this ability if he hits a
        target with a melee weapon. He must hit with a Brawl or
        Martial Arts attack.

        Living descendants of ghosts who have sufficient
        filial piety to remember and honor their ancestors often
        make sacrifices to their ancestors’ ghosts. These sacri-
        fices become Essence and Willpower in the Underworld
        (see Exalted: The Abyssals, p. 33, for details). Each
        such sacrifice appears in the Underworld as a black-jade
        token inscribed with the name of the ghost for whom it
        is intended. The token appears in the Underworld
        location corresponding with the spot in Creation at
        which the sacrifice is performed. A canny ghost with
        Redirected Prayer Path can intercept these sacrifices.
        While standing within five yards of the Underworld
        spot where the token arrives, the ghost can spend
        Willpower and activates this Charm. The black jade
        token appears, with this ghost’s name inscribed on it,
        and for all intents and purposes, the token and its
        contents are considered to be his.&lt;br&gt;
        If two or more ghosts use this Charm simultaneously,
        each one’s player must make a Manipulation + Larceny
        roll. The ghost achieving the most successes wins, and the
        token is inscribed with his name.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Ghosts have a difficult time healing damage. Typically,
        they must use Arcanoi or enter Slumber to do so.
        Cannibal Call allows a ghost to heal damage by biting
        another ghost and literally devouring its corpus. This
        requires a successful bite attack (if the ghost has no
        special abilities that enable a bite attack like an animal’s
        bite, the bite is at –3 speed, 0B damage and -2 accuracy
        and defense, and if using Exalted Power Combat, its rate
        is 3). If the ghost succeeds, he heals one health level for
        every two health levels damage done to the target.

        This Arcanos turns Essence into coinage. To properly
        replicate the local coin, the ghost’s player rolls
        Intelligence + Larceny, and the ghost spends as many
        motes of Essence as he wishes, to a maximum of his
        Temperance. If the player succeeds in the roll, the ghost
        creates a pile of local coinage sufficient to provide a
        bonus to his Resources level equal to one dot per 2
        motes of Essence spent. This is a temporary Resources
        level (though the coinage is permanent) — it is sufficient
        to make a single purchase at that Resources level.
        Once that purchase is made, the coinage is disbursed
        into the population, and the ghost reverts to his normal
        Resources Background (which represents his sustainable
        income).

<h2>Chains of the Ancient Monarchs<a class="headerlink" href="#chains-of-the-ancient-monarchs" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This art descends from the enforcers and magistrates
of the Dual Monarchy in Stygia. Variations on their
talents have spread throughout the Underworld, though,
to the point where any ghost who holds a true allegiance
to an undead sovereign may learn and use these Arcanoi.
A ghost who learns this art doesn’t have to truly be an
authorized enforcer of his monarch — nor does he have to
possess true, deep loyalty to his lord — but he performs the
Arcanoi below in his lord’s name.</p>

        Minions of various dead monarchs use this Arcanos
        to keep criminals and battlefield foes from escaping
        justice. When Soul Anchor is active, no one within 25
        yards of the ghost using it is able to use supernatural
        abilities to move faster than they could at a full sprint.
        This prohibition even extends to the ghost using Soul
        Anchor! The ghost may be able to fly or run up walls,
        and he is still able to do that, but he cannot move faster
        than he could at an ordinary run. Ghosts and other
        entities with an Essence higher than that of the ghost
        using Soul Anchor may spend a Willpower point to
        overcome the effect of this Arcanos.

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The ghost using Monarch’s Glorious Brilliance
        channels some of the splendor of his undead liege lord
        (whether a Deathlord or another monarch) into a coruscating
        white aura. This brilliance makes the ghost
        visible from quite a long way off — the light can be seen
        from a mile away on an ordinary day in the Underworld
        and from the horizon at night. Entities within 20 yards
        who happen to be looking in the ghost’s direction at the
        time this Arcanos is activated are temporarily blinded,
        and their players must make a Wits + Resistance roll for
        the characters to look away as quickly as possible.
        Targets are blinded for three turns, minus one for every
        success on that Wits + Resistance roll. Those targets
        that are not blinded by the brilliance must still look
        away from the glorious light or be blinded, so they are
        considered to be blind with respect to the ghost using
        this Arcanos. Foes immune to blindness and those
        wearing heavy whole-face helmets are immune to this
        Charm. The effects of blindness are described in Exalted,
        pages 237-238 — a blind character loses two
        successes from all attack rolls.

        Essence Binding&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Soul Anchor&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Essence Binding calls up bands of Essence representing
        the ghost’s authority in the name of his ruler(s). He
        then uses those bands to temporarily restrain his foe’s
        hands or feet. This Arcanos works only on corporeal foes
        (ghosts in the Underworld, mortals anywhere). The
        ghost-magistrate spends his Essence, and his player then
        rolls Dexterity + Bureaucracy at + 2 accuracy to extend
        his sovereign’s influence. The ghost must determine
        whether he plans to bind the target’s hands or feet. The
        attack works only within hand-to-hand combat range,
        and the target may dodge or block this attack if he is able
        to do so. If the Essence Binding succeeds, the target’s
        hands or feet are bound. If the target’s hands are bound to
        his body, he may use no weapon that requires two hands,
        and he is considered to be held as the victim of a hold
        attack. If the target’s feet are bound, he is restricted to
        using unusual modes of locomotion (walking on his
        hands, swinging by a rope, flying) or to hopping no more
        than one-fifth his normal movement per turn. This
        binding lasts for one turn for every success achieved on
        the Dexterity + Bureaucracy roll, above. The bonds can
        be broken by main strength. A total of four successes is
        required on a Strength + Athletics roll to break them
        (and this is a simple action).

        &lt;br&gt;
        A ghost with Snare the Fleeing Thief can use his
        Essence and his dedication to his liege to halt an enemy in
        her tracks for a short period of time. This Charm doesn’t
        merely create binding ropes of Essence. Instead, it encases
        the enemy’s body in a light somewhat reminiscent of
        Monarch’s Glorious Brilliance. The enemy can still move
        around while encased in this brilliance but at a greatly
        reduced speed — no more than one-fifth her normal
        movement per turn, no matter what form of locomotion is
        being used. Snare the Fleeing Thief requires a hand-to-hand
        attack using a Dexterity + Bureaucracy roll at +4
        accuracy. This attack can be dodged or blocked as normal.
        If the ghost bypasses such defenses, the target is bound as
        described above for one minute per success.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm works similarly to Essence Binding, save
        that it works at a range of up to 10 yards per point of
        Conviction and that it cannot be blocked, only dodged.
        The ghost calls up a binding in the name of his sovereign,
        points at the target and spends his Essence, and his player
        rolls Dexterity + Bureaucracy at +2 accuracy. This attack
        cannot be parried, as it bypasses such defenses. The
        target’s hands or feet are bound for one turn per success.
        If the target’s hands are bound to his body, he may use no
        weapon that requires two hands, nor may he swing his
        arms around to make effective Melee or Brawl attacks
        against any foe that isn’t right up against him. If the
        target’s feet are bound, he is restricted to using unusual
        modes of locomotion (walking on his hands, swinging by
        a rope, flying) or to hopping no more than one-fifth his
        normal movement per turn.

        Net allows a ghostly magistrate to ensnare a group of
        enemies, binding them hand-and-foot in the name of his
        lord. The ghost spends his Essence and designates a target
        location no more than five yards away per dot of Conviction.
        Everyone within five yards of that location is
        ensnared in a binding net of Essence, unless they successfully
        leap to safety — the ghost uses Dexterity +
        Bureaucracy to target the net, and targets must successfully
        dodge (not block) it to get out of the area of effect
        in time. Those caught in the net are considered to be held
        (see Exalted, p. 240) until the effect ends or they expend
        a point of Willpower to free themselves from the Arcanos.
