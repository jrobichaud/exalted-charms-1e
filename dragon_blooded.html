<p><strong>Elemental Attunement</strong></p>
<p>Dragon-Blooded wielding Charms of a different element than their aspect
must always pay one more mote of Essence than the
Charm would normally require. This is a flat fee. of 1
mote. If a Charm is used multiple times in a simple turn,
the extra mote need be paid only for the first activation
of the turn. If using in a Combo, the character must pay
the 1 mote surcharge once for each Charm of an element
different from her own. The Combo surcharge is payable
immediately upon activation of the Combo.</p>
<p>For Example: A Wood-aspected Dynast uses a Combo
containing Wood, Fire and Water Charms. She must pay
a 2 mote surcharge upon activating the Combo; 1 mote for
Fire Charms, 1 mote for Wood Charms. This is on top of
any costs to activate the individual Charms and the 1
temporary Willpower to activate the Combo.</p>
<p>Members of the Eclipse Caste who learn these Charms
have no element and, thus, have no Charms for which they
do not pay the surcharge.</p>

        Element Blow Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: Varies&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Melee: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Terrestrial Exalted charges her weapon with the
        Essence of her favored element. An Aspect of Fire's weapon
        flickers with flame; an Aspect of Water's weapon shim-
        mers wetly and moves with eerie, fluid grace; the weapon
        of an Aspect of Air glitters with frost or crackles with
        lightning; an Aspect of Earth's weapon grows more massive
        and gleams like polished stone; the weapon of an
        Aspect of Wood character glows like polished wood or
        sunlight through leaves. For each mote of Essence the
        Exalted's player spends on this Charm, she may add one die
        to a single attack, but can no more than double her regular
        Melee Ability. If the character's specialties apply to the
        attack, she may double those as well.&lt;br&gt;
        Dragon-Blooded characters who know this Charm
        may employ it at will if they use a weapon that bears the
        appropriately colored jade in its hilt (black for water, red
        for fire and so on). With other weapons, the character must
        spend one turn executing a special weapon flourish and
        touching the weapon to the appropriate element. Air-
        attuned Dynasts seldom find this a problem; Dragon-Bloods
        attuned to Fire may suffer more inconvenience.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A Dragon-Blooded character with a higher Essence
        rating could conjure the elemental effect without the need
        for jade or touching the weapon to the appropriate element.&lt;br&gt;
        • An even more powerful Dynast could pull a weapon
        from the appropriate element. For instance, a Fire-attuned
        character could grab the flame from a candle and grow it
        into a sword; an Air-attuned character could conjure a
        weapon of glittering ice from a handful of snow.

        The character unleashes a bolt of elemental force
        extends from her hand — a blast of ice, or fire, a barbed
        javelin, a stroke of lightning or slashing shards of crystal. The
        character rolls Dexterity + Athletics or Archery (whichever
        she prefers) to hit. This attack has a range increment of 20
        yards x the character's permanent Essence, and does a base
        damage of 2 for every mote of Essence she spends activating
        it. The character cannot spend more motes activating this
        Charm than she has points of permanent Essence.

        Dragon-Blooded embarking on diplomatic missions
        often invoke this Charm. By spending an hour meditating
        and listening to a native speak the language to be learned,
        the Exalt absorbs the knowledge of the language into her
        mind. The character needs some sort of focus to meditate
        on, usually a cultural object related to or a book written in
        the language to be learned. For the Charm's duration, the
        Dragon-Blooded is completely fluent and naturally conversant
        in the language, without even a trace of an accent.
        The character may also read and write the language. Once
        the duration expires, the knowledge fades immediately.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The far-ranging colonial interests of the Dragon-
        Blooded combine with the Air-aspected Exalt's close
        affinity with communication to make this Charm a
        common one.&lt;br&gt;
        The character speaking in tongues can easily speak
        and understand any spoken language for the duration of
        the Charm. If speaking to beings each speaking a different
        language, the character can understand them all, and they
        can all understand the character — but they will still be
        unable to understand each other. The maximum number
        of beings that an Exalted may speak in tongues to at once
        is equal to the character's permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm just allows the most basic of communication-
        the equivalent of baby or pidgin speech. Any sort
        of social or communicative actions attempted by the
        character are at -4 to her dice pools. Each point of
        permanent Essence that the Dragon-Blood possesses over the
        minimum requirement reduces this penalty by -1.
        This Charm only works on actual speech. Sign language
        cannot be understood through the use of the
        Thousand Tongues Meditation.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows an Exalted to &amp;quot;hijack&amp;quot; another's
        conversation. The effect is subtle, but it can be deadly if
        applied correctly. The Exalt must be able to hear the
        conversation to twist it, but need not actually be present.
        Eavesdropping through Charms such as Voices on the
        Wind is perfectly permissible, but the range of this
        Charm cannot be extended past 100 feet x the Exalt's
        permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        To twist a conversation, the character's player must
        roll Manipulation + Linguistics. The number of successes
        indicates the degree to which the Dragon-Blooded can
        twist the conversation. A single success would allow her to
        send someone away from a conversation confused, aroused
        or with a sour taste in his mouth. Three or more successes
        are enough to make a speaker seem heroic, amorous,
        ruthless or offensive. Five successes allow the Dragon-Blood
        to completely hijack the conversation, changing or
        amending anything said by any party.&lt;br&gt;
        The participants in the conversation each get a reflexive
        Wits + Perception roll at a roll to notice the use of
        this Charm. The difficulty of the roll is the Essence of the
        Exalt using this Charm. If this roll fails, the character
        doesn't realize that what he means to say and what he's
        actually saying doesn't match and has no way of knowing
        the conversation was altered. If the roll succeeds, he
        realizes the conversation is being manipulated and can
        indicate this through nonverbal means (normally a chop-
        ping motion at one's own throat). Use of this Charm in a
        criminal fashion is a serious offense in the Realm and can
        bring with it a death sentence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With more complete mastery of the Air element, the
        Dragon-Blooded can use this Charm to enhance the effect
        of his spoken words. His words seem to resonate with
        listeners, seeming more persuasive, threatening, seductive
        - whatever the Dragon-Blood wishes.&lt;br&gt;
        For the duration of this Charm, the character may add
        his Essence dice to his dice pool for any interaction involving
        speech, whether it is seduction, persuasion or intimidation.
        The Charm normally affects only one listener. Each additional
        mote doubles the number of people affected by the
        Charm. The character must be able to speak the targets
        language, either naturally or through the use of Charms.

        Wind-Carried Words Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote per sentence, plus distance&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Linguistics: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        The wind carries many things, and sound can be one
        of them. A Terrestrial Exalted can set his words on the
        currents of the wind, sending them through the air to the
        ear of the one he wishes to hear his message.
        For the base Essence cost, a character may send one
        single sentence to the ear of any other person in range. The
        character does not actually have to speak what he wishes
        to say out loud, but he does at least have to vaguely mouth
        the words he wishes to send.&lt;br&gt;
        The difficulty of sending words on the wind increases
        over distance. The further away a character wants to send
        a message, the more difficult the Charm becomes. For a
        single mote of Essence, a character can send a single
        sentence to roughly 100 feet away. This distance is modified
        by the permanent Essence of the character and by the
        expenditure of additional motes of Essence. Multiply the
        100-foot range by the character's permanent Essence score.
        In addition, by doubling the amount of Essence spent on
        the Charm, this modified base range can be increased by a
        factor of 10. An Air-aspected Dynast with an Essence of 4
        could send a single sentence 400 feet for 1 mote, 4,000 feet
        for 2 motes, 40,000 feet for 3 motes and so on.
        The sending character must have a general sense of
        the target's direction, but need not see her. This Charm
        has become essential to the Realm's military operations, as
        it gives the Terrestrial Exalted the ability to communicate
        quickly over long distances on the battlefield. Most Dragon
        Blooded of military inclination know the Charm.

        Prerequisite Charms: Wind-Carried Words Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Speech requires breath, the very air of life. Some
        Dynasts of Air can extend their senses through the air and
        so listen to what people far from them say. The further
        away a character wants to eavesdrop, the more expensive
        the Charm becomes. For the basic cost, an Air-aspected
        Dragon-Blood can clearly hear normal speech from 100
        feet away. The character also gets a general sense of the
        target's direction (assuming he doesn't know already). As
        with the Wind-Carried Words Technique, the cost of
        using this Charm increases over distance. The further
        away a character wants to eavesdrop, the more expensive
        the Charm becomes. For a single mote of Essence, a
        character can listen in on speech roughly 100 feet away.
        This distance is modified by the permanent Essence of the
        character and by the expenditure of additional motes of
        Essence. Multiply the 100-foot range by the character's
        permanent Essence score. In addition, by doubling the
        amount of Essence spent on the Charm, this modified base
        range can be increased by a factor of 10.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm has some limitations. The character must
        specify a single person he wants to spy upon: He cannot, for
        instance, declare that he will &amp;quot;listen for people plotting
        against me.&amp;quot; At most, he can make a list of suspected
        enemies and eavesdrop on them one by one. The character
        also cannot hear anything spoken in an airtight chamber.
        Many of the powerful Dynasts build such chambers for
        their privy councils, specifically to defeat this Charm.
        Finally, listening to a person from so far away demands
        total concentration — the character cannot perform any
        other action while listening to Voices on the Wind.

        A Dynast of Air can enable a group of people to know
        each other's surface thoughts. What one sees, all the others
        see as well. Her tactical decisions are an open book to her
        allies. As a result, a group that fights using With One Mind
        displays uncanny coordination. They trade off opponents
        without a hitch; one fighter parries a blow aimed at
        another; an enemy seen by one cannot hide from any.&lt;br&gt;
        For each mote that the Dragon-Blooded character
        spends, the recipients gain one dot each of Wits, Perception
        and Melee, up to the Dragon-Blooded character's own
        Linguistics rating. In addition, any of the linked characters
        can parry or abort to parry an attack against any other
        character in the group, provided he is close enough to
        plausibly do so. If multiple characters parry a given attack,
        subtract all their successes from the attack roll.&lt;br&gt;
        The initiating character can link as many people
        using With One Mind as she has dots of Essence, but all
        those linked must have the same level of linkage, and the
        Exalt must pay to enhance each of them. The linked
        group must include the character herself, and there is no
        benefit to be gained from using this Charm unless at least
        two people are linked with it. Dynasts typically use this
        Charm to magnify the fighting prowess of their bodyguards
        or minions.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters linked by this Charm must have trained
        together for at least a week. They must spend a turn on
        a shared breathing exercise and war-shout to initiate
        the link. The characters must also stay within 50 feet x
        highest Essence of the participants of one another. If
        any character moves beyond that range, the link breaks,
        and the Charm ends.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm also has non-combat uses, allowing instantaneous
        nonverbal communication between the linked
        group for the duration.

            In the matters of governance, commerce and
            military action that are the focus of Dynastic society,
            there is always sensitive material that must be communicated
            and, thus, a need for secure methods to
            encrypt such material. This Charm allows an Exalted
            scribe to augment her knowledge of the structure of
            language and to use that augmented knowledge to
            create a preternaturally complex cipher.
            The scribing character spends the required
            amount of time writing the document, which can be
            no longer that her Essence in pages, and her player
            rolls Intelligence + Linguistics to determine the
            total number of accumulated successes needed to
            decipher the document. Each deciphering roll is an
            Intelligence + Linguistics roll with a difficulty equal
            to the permanent Essence of the character using
            Cipher Missive, and represents a number of days
            spent codebreaking equal to the Essence of the character
            who created the cipher. Remember that
            successes only accumulate against the encoding
            character’s Intelligence + Linguistics roll if the character
            attempting to decrypt the missive exceeds the
            base difficulty of the roll (i.e., the Essence of the
            character who used this Charm).&lt;br&gt;
            The character using this Charm may name a
            number of individuals up to a maximum of twice his
            Essence rating who can freely read the ciphered document,
            or he may name a limited, specific class of
            people who may freely read the document. For example,
            a character could make a ciphered document
            that could only be read freely by magistrates or only by
            officers in the Vermilion Legion.

                In a society as complex and often frenetic as that
                of the Realm, the ability to smoothly convey a com-
                plex block of information or directives to others is not
                only a great boon, it is practically a necessity. This
                Charm allows for the design of sigils and pictograms
                that illustrate a dense collection of data such as direc-
                tions to a location or instructions for the assembly of
                a complex device and does so in a simple iconographic
                style that can be understood by anyone, regardless of
                the languages they speak.&lt;br&gt;
                The player of the Dragon-Blood using this Charm
                rolls Manipulation + Linguistics at a difficulty of 2.
                Successes indicate the level of complexity encoded
                into the pictogram, with each success over the difficulty
                providing the equivalent of one minute's worth
                of careful instruction.&lt;br&gt;
                The icons created by the use of this Charm can be
                drawn, carved or in any media the creator wishes to
                use. The channeling of Essence into the creation of an
                icon is vital to its depiction, and it cannot be reliably
                reproduced without another application of Craft Icon.
                Any mundane reproduction of a pictogram created
                with this Charm will, at best, serve only as well as if
                the Dragon-Blood's player had rolled the minimum
                two successes. Icons created with this Charm are two
                square inches in size per success.

            The ability to silently convey complex information
            allows for a much greater degree of coordination
            among allies when they find themselves in circumstances
            where speech would be a detriment, such as
            during close-range martial conflicts or ambushes most
            obviously (but not exclusively).&lt;br&gt;
            The use of this Charm allows a Dragon-Blood and
            one additional ally per mote of Essence spent (to a
            maximum of the Exalt's Wits + Linguistics) to silently
            communicate using hand gestures and signals.&lt;br&gt;
            The gestures required to make use of this Charm
            are subtle and not enough to give away a user's
            position or generate a great amount of sound.
            Users of this Charm are obviously communicating
            with one another if they do so openly, however,
            making this Charm's usefulness in social settings
            somewhat limited.

            Dragon-Blooded culture demands excellence from
            its constituents in a variety of fields of endeavor,
            making a broad education the norm. With so many
            responsibilities and areas of study open to them as a
            culture, however, specialists are needed for esoteric,
            demanding or vital disciplines. Linguistic- and communication-
            oriented tasks are no exception to this, as
            not every Dragon-Blood can be a master cipher,
            speechwriter and poet all at once.&lt;br&gt;
            An Exalt using this Charm may buy his dots in a
            Linguistics specialty as automatic successes, rolling
            the remainder of his pool as normal. The automatic
            successes may only be added to rolls involving the

            This Charm allows the Dragon-Blood to parse
            the hidden layers of metaphor and symbolism after
            reading a text. Under normal circumstances, where
            the layers are apparent to those of a creative enough
            mind with sufficient study, the deeper meanings stand
            revealed instantly. The Dragon-Blood using this Charm
            is automatically aware or what each symbol or metaphor
            represents according to the author's intent and
            subconscious meanderings, even if the relevance or
            obviousness of such a symbol would not be apparent to
            someone living in the present day, as is often the case
            when reading ancient texts.&lt;br&gt;
            However, if the writer tried to bury the symbols
            purposely, either through a conscious effort at ciphering
            them (requiring an Intelligence + Lore
            roll) or with a Charm, then the Dragon-Blood's
            player must make an opposed roll against the successes
            from the Charm or on the Intelligence + Lore
            roll. The Dragon-Blood using this Charm in such an
            attempt gains a number of automatic successes
            equal to his Essence. This Charm does not aid in
            breaking ciphers or codes, only in delving into the
            hidden meanings within a text, be that text an
            ancient poem or the results of an augury.

        Fire Blast Trap Trick&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        This peculiar Charm finds use among Dragon-Bloods
        who worry about thieves. It takes a clever hand, though, to
        trap a fire inside a box, jar or bottle so that it can't go out.
        The Dynast must place a bit of fuel inside the container —
        firedust from the far south works best — set it on fire, then
        slap the lid shut and seal it just right. When someone opens
        the container, the captive fire explodes, much larger and
        hotter from anger at being trapped. A typical use for the
        fire trap is to rig it inside a trunk or cupboard so that anyone
        who opens it the wrong way pops open the hidden container
        and set off the trap.&lt;br&gt;
        Like most Charms with long-term effects, the fire trap
        &amp;quot;ties up&amp;quot; the mote of Essence used to set it up. For this
        reason, the Aspects of Fire do not manufacture fire traps by
        the dozen. Creating a fire trap takes just a minute, but the
        trap itself can last indefinitely. The trap lasts even after its
        creator's death, if she never reclaimed its Essence. The fire
        trap's explosion has a three-foot radius. The player rolls
        Dexterity + Lore. As well as causing a flash and loud bang,
        for each success the player rolls, the trap does a number of
        points of lethal damage equal to the Essence of the Exalted
        who set the trap, soaked normally. Obviously, fire traps are
        unsuitable for guarding anything that flame could destroy.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • The Fire Blast Trap Trick needs few improvements.
        One possibility is an improved fire trap whose flame fills a
        larger area.

            By communing with the living spirit of a plant, a
            Dragon-Blooded character can rouse it to grow with impossible,
            supernatural speed. A seed can grow into a flower.
            A seedling can become a sturdy sapling. What's more, the
            character can shape the plant's growth. Although instant
            topiary is an esthetically pleasing application, a character
            can also grow trees so they crack stone walls with their
            roots, produce living ladders from ivy or perform other
            useful tricks.&lt;br&gt;
            To employ this Charm, the character must lightly
            stroke the target plant, softly hum or sing to the spirit
            within it and supply it with water. For every minute and
            mote of Essence expended, the plant experiences up to a
            full year's worth of growth. Thus, growing an annual flower
            from a seed requires only one minute and one mote of
            Essence; growing an oak tree 20 years old from an acorn
            takes 20 minutes and 20 motes of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
            Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
            • With greater Lore or Essence, the character could
            learn to grow and shape trees with greater speed and less
            cost of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
            • A plant might actually animate for a short time to
            work the Dragon-Blooded character's will.&lt;br&gt;
            • A plant could grow supernaturally large. A bower of
            giant flowers aids any courtship; more bizarre options
            include giant gourds or pumpkins as houses or boats.&lt;br&gt;
            • A really powerful Dynast might be able to make a
            tree grow around a captured enemy, trapping him in
            ageless slumber until someone cuts the tree down.

        This Charm is the most basic of Lore techniques
        known by the Dragon-Blooded. Through the use of this
        Charm, the character concentrates on her aligned element,
        centering herself and opening her mind. The Exalt
        can compact a week's worth of learning into a single day,
        assuming she has access to all the necessary materials. This
        Charm can be used on sequential days, but use of it for more
        days than the character's Lore skill causes one level of
        unsoakable lethal damage per day. This damage can only
        be healed by time, and it does not begin healing until one
        week after the characters suffers it.

        Proper knowledge of the Elemental Dragons allows a
        Dynast to draw energy directly from an elemental source,
        restoring depleted reserves in times of crisis.&lt;br&gt;
        The Elemental Empowerment Meditation requires
        the character to spend Willpower points while in contact
        with her aligned element. The character must be able to
        physically touch the element she is aligned with to draw
        Essence from it. For every point of willpower spent in this
        way, the character instantly gains Essence motes equal to
        her Lore. These motes can be spent normally.&lt;br&gt;
        There is a price to be paid for handling elementals
        energy in such a raw fashion. If a character spends more
        Willpower in a single day to draw elemental energy than
        her permanent Essence score, each additional use of Willpower
        to increase her Essence causes one unsoakable level
        of bashing damage.

        In addition to providing raw energy, a Dynast's
        connection to the Elemental Dragons can be a source of
        great resilience and strength in desperate times. Elemental
        Succor Method lets a Dragon-Blood tap into
        the elemental energy of the Dragons to restore her body,
        healing her injuries. That character must be able to
        immerse herself in her favored element to the greatest
        degree possible (standing in a burning fire, submerged
        in water, etc.) and must spend 5 motes and 1 Willpower
        for every lethal health level to be healed of 2 motes per
        bashing health level to be healed. The Elemental Succor
        Method will not restore lost limbs or repair other

        permanent Essence, and it does a base damage of 2L for
        every mote of Essence spent. The accuracy of the attack
        is equal to the character's Essence. A character cannot
        spend more motes on this Charm than her Stamina.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm has effects similar to Elemental Bolt
        Attack but it creates a blast of elemental power rather
        than hurling a bolt. The character's player rolls Dexterity
        Athletics or Archery (whichever he prefers) to hit,
        with an accuracy bonus equal to the character's permanent
        Essence. This attack has a range increment of 20
        yards x the character's permanent Essence. The Elemental
        Burst Technique affects a circular area with a radius
        equal to the character's permanent Essence in yards.
        Anyone in that area who fails to dodge or parry the attack
        takes a base damage of 1L for every more the Dragon-Blooded
        invested in the Charm.

        Rather than just summoning a temporary damaging
        burst of elemental energy, this Charm creates a deadly
        maelstrom of the character's elemental aspect. Whether it
        is a sudden rain of fire, a roiling whirlwind of air or a
        grinding cloud of stone and earth, all within the area of
        effect suffer the character's wrath.&lt;br&gt;
        Anyone in the area of the Dragon Vortex Attack,
        other than the character who summoned it, takes lethal
        damage equal to the character's Essence every turn, as she
        is battered by flying shards of stone, sliced by razor-thin ice
        crystals, burned by swirling gouts of flame, and so on. This
        damage cannot be dodged or parried. The Dragon-Blooded
        who created it is exempt from these effects, and may act
        normally in all respects. The Dragon Vortex extends 10
        feet from the character per point of his permanent Essence.
        It is stationary once invoked, and not even the character
        can voluntarily terminate it before its duration expires,
        although killing the character will end it.

            Diligence and intellect, properly applied, can
            surmount the most difficult of systemic or academic
            pursuits. Diligence and intellect coupled with the
            magical acumen of a talented Exalt can accomplish in
            a matter of hours what could otherwise require months
            of work from a dedicated team of scholars.&lt;br&gt;
            Through the use of this Charm, a Dragon-Blooded
            scholar can virtually guarantee high-quality results on
            any academic or systemic task by using Essence to
            strengthen and structure his thoughts and mind, gain-
            ing a crystalline clarity. For each hour of dedicated
            work and 2 motes of Essence, the Dragon-Blood's
            player gains an automatic success on any roll pertain-
            ing to academic studies, research, analysis or any
            other type of &amp;quot;book work&amp;quot; the character is conducting,
            to a maximum of the character's Lore Ability (including
            specialties, if applicable).&lt;br&gt;
            The hours spent in study for the use of this Charm
            must be concurrent, and any interruption of the
            character's activities will require him to begin anew,
            losing any Essence spent in the Charm's activation.
            Due to the highly structured changes worked on the
            mind by use of this Charm, characters suffer an effective
            -1 penalty to their Compassion Virtue Trait for a
            number of hours after using this Charm equal to the
            number of hours of study (even if the Charm fails due
            to interruption). Those who make repeated, long-term
            use of this Charm grow detached and often cold
            toward others. Storytellers may reduce the Compas-
            sion of characters who rely overmuch on this Charm
            but should warn players if they think their characters
            are overusing the Charm. Generally, more uses per
            lunar month than a character's Essence should be
            considered abuse.

            Sometimes, solutions to complicated problems
            are needed on the spot, without the luxury of analysis
            by engineers or scholars. When a dam or other vital
            structure is damaged, for example, an effective plan
            must be made before the structure fails and further
            hampers normal operating procedures.&lt;br&gt;
            A Terrestrial scholar may bring the full force of
            his mind and accumulated academic training to bear
            on a single problem with the use of this Charm,
            straining his mind with Essence and condensing days
            of analysis into a single, staggering moment of insight.
            For every 2 motes of Essence spent, the character
            may purchase an automatic success on any roll involving
            an analytical or scholarly task, up to a limit
            of his Lore Ability. The remainder of the pool is then
            rolled normally. The character's player must then
            roll to soak, using the Dragon-Blood's Wits At-
            tribute, a number of bashing health levels equal to
            the total successes on the roll, as the Exalt attempts
            to mentally digest and sort the rush of information.
            It is common, after using this Charm, for a character
            to experience violent nosebleeds, sporadic weakening
            of vision and hearing and excruciating headaches.
            Regardless of the results of the soak roll, each use of
            this Charm counts as a full day's exertion for the
            character, who must then deal with the effects of
            sleep deprivation or use a Charm or item to counter
            it. The bashing damage dealt through the use of this
            Charm may be healed using whatever methods are
            available to the character.

            With a potential lifespan of centuries, and those
            centuries almost surely densely packed with all manner
            of both excitement and study, the memories of the
            Dragon-Blooded can become quite cluttered. Dedicated
            scholars especially, who have a long lifetime's
            worth of books and observations on which they likely
            wish to meditate, find that the enervation of the
            memory with Essence can allow them near-perfect
            recall of any event they have witnessed or any mate-
            rial they have read.&lt;br&gt;
            After spending the required Essence, a Dragon-Blood
            spends a moment in contemplation, and his
            player rolls the Exalt's Intelligence + Lore, with the
            number of successes indicating how far into his memory
            the Dragon-Blood may explore. One success is enough
            to recall a hurried conversation from a few years prior,
            while five allows the user to reexperience events from
            primary school. Some savants have even claimed to
            recall memories of time spent in their mothers' wombs
            through the use of this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
            While using this Charm, the character is not
            helpless or unaware of his surroundings, as he is not
            truly immersed in reexperiencing the events of his
            past. He experiences them normally, as memories,
            simply perfectly detailed and accurate memories.

            Savants entertain a great variety of individually
            focused fields of study. Nearly every scholar, dabbler
            and professional alike, has her favored era of history,
            mathematical discipline or school of philosophy. True
            pundits, through the use of this Charm, can enjoy
            flawlessly reliable intuition and produce repeatable
            results within their chosen areas of focus.&lt;br&gt;
            For every 3 motes of Essence spent to fuel the
            use of this Charm, one of the character's levels of a
            Lore specialty can be converted to an automatic
            success. The rest of the character's Lore pool is
            rolled normally.

            Individual study, for a savant, may be a relaxing
            and prestigious pastime, regardless of the specific area
            of endeavor. Professional undertakings and the work
            of students do not allow for the slow pace and low
            pressure necessary to produce the results enjoyed by
            those who study for leisure. In such cases, and others,
            it is efficient and effective to establish a hierarchy
            within which the more skilled savants are on hand to
            advise and to proof the work of the lesser savants or
            students. An overseer who uses this Charm can take
            this methodology a step further, weaving connections
            of Essence between herself and those under her to
            maximize the collective cognition of the group.&lt;br&gt;
            On activation of the Charm, the player rolls his
            character's Charisma + Lore. For the remainder of the
            day's study, the character may use these successes as a
            pool from which he can reflexively allocate additional
            dice to rolls made by those under his tutelage, including
            during a roll that has resulted in a failure or botch.
            The character can, for example, add dice one at a time
            to his charge's roll until the pool of extra dice is
            depleted or the charge cancels his botch or failure.

            Water has deep connections to the spirit world.
            Dragon-Blooded characters with occult interests can use
            this connection to see and communicate with the unseen
            spirits of the world. The character requires nothing more

            concentrates, she can see nearby spirits reflected in the
            water and hear what they say. A clever Dragon-Blood
            might even do this without the spirits noticing - for
            instance, by using a goblet of water and taking a sip now
            and then, while pretending to do something else.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Dragon-Blooded are not born occultists and
        magicians like some Celestial Exalted, but many of them
        study the supernatural lore of their favored element. Many
        Aspects of Air learn the ways of the spirits who create the
        weather through their dances and processions in the sky.
        Exalted who know the ways of the sky-spirits can call them
        to direct the wind. One must speak to the elementals in
        their own tongue: the sounds of wind sighing over stony
        crags and through treetops, and the rumbles of thunder.
        Some Aspects of Air imitate such sounds with their voice
        and a bullroarer. Others might play a flute or position a
        harp so the wind plucks its strings. Inviting the winds to
        blow takes five minutes.&lt;br&gt;
        This basic Charm evokes nothing more than a stiff
        breeze — still enough to interfere with archery or send a
        sailing ship scudding through the waves at top speed
        During the hour of the Charm's effect, the character can
        control the magic wind's direction by singing and whirling
        his bullroarer for a turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • As the character's Essence rating rises, Charms for
        more powerful winds become possible, all the way up to
        gale force. Old tales mention the great Lords of Air who
        could evoke hurricanes and tornadoes by working together.
        That may be true, but nobody has done it recently.&lt;br&gt;
        • A character can also show greater mastery of the air
        through Charms to command lightning, hail, snow and
        other sorts of storms. (Some of these Charms are also
        suitable for Dragon-Blooded attuned to Water.)

        Air is the most closely connected to the spirit world of
        all of the five elements. As such, it is easier for the Aspects
        of Air to pierce the veil and see the unseen.&lt;br&gt;
        To invoke a Spirit Mirror requires an ordinary mirror,
        a piece of polished metal or some other reflective surface.
        Even a pool of still water will suffice. For the remainder of
        the scene, the Exalt using this Charm can see nearby spirits
        reflected in such surfaces and, if they are reflected, hear
        what they say. A clever Dragon-Blood might even do this
        without the spirits noticing — for instance, by using a
        goblet of water and taking a sip now and then or by
        polishing a sword blade.

        treetops, and the rumbles of thunder. Some Aspects of Air
        imitate such sounds with their voice and a bull-roarer.
        Others might play a flute or position a harp so that the
        wind plucks its strings. Whatever the method used, inviting
        the winds to blow takes five minutes.&lt;br&gt;
        This basic Charm evokes nothing more than a stiff
        breeze — still enough to interfere with archery or send a
        sailing ship scudding through the waves at a good speed.
        During the hour of the Charm's effect, the character can
        control the magic wind's direction by singing for a turn.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Dragon-Bloods must protect the common people
        of the Realm from the various supernatural beings that
        roam the landscape. Often, the most effective method of
        accomplishing this task with regard to spirits is to simply.
        force them into the physical world and defeat them there.
        This Charm aids greatly in that tactic. The character utters
        the Spirit-Grounding Shout, and reflexive opposed Essence
        rolls are made for both her and the target spirit. If the
        Exalt wins, the spirit is forced to materialize, If she loses,
        the spirit may remain dematerialized.&lt;br&gt;
        A successful Spirit-Grounding Shout forces the spirit
        to manifest itself for no less that the Exalt's permanent
        Essence in minutes. The Essence for this materialization
        (assuming the spirit is naturally immaterial and must pay.
        to materialize) is first drained from the spirit's reserves, but
        any remaining cost is drained from the Exalt uttering the
        shout. If there is not enough Essence between the spirit
        and the character to pay for the manifestation, the spirit
        remains immaterial, but the Essence is still lost.
        This Charm has no effect on spirits with permanent
        Essences higher than the Dragon-Blood's.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows the Dragon-Blooded to immobilize
        spirit beings, which is often the first step toward
        eliminating them.&lt;br&gt;
        The character must strike the spirit with an attack,
        and then his player immediately makes a reflexive Intelligence
        + Occult roll with a difficulty equal to the spirit's
        Essence. Each extra success imposes as a one-die penalty
        to any and all actions taken by the spirit. If the penalty
        exceeds the spirit's Essence rating, it is immobilized and
        unable to act for the rest of the scene. Subsequent uses of
        this Charm are additive, so long as the Charm never
        lapses. Additionally, Spirit Chains used by other Dragon-Blood
        are additive as well.&lt;br&gt;
        Spirit Chains affect a spirit whether it is manifested
        or not, but the character must be able to perceive and
        strike the spirit to bind it. Spirit-Chaining Strike is
        explicitly permitted to be made part of a Combo with
        Charms of other Abilities.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Sometimes, restraining a spirit is not enough, and
        destruction becomes necessary. The Spirit-Shredding
        Attack is an effective tool for this. Invoking this Charm
        requires a successful physical attack against a Spirit. This
        means that the spirit must be materialized and/or the
        character must have some method of actually affecting the
        spirit, whether it is a weapon or an attack that can affect
        incorporeal beings.&lt;br&gt;
        A blow struck with this Charm does its normal damage
        to spirits. In addition, the attacking Exalt's player
        reflexively rolls his characters Willpower + Essence against
        a difficulty of the spirit's Essence: Each extra success reduces
        the spirit's temporary Essence by an amount equal to the
        Dragon-Blooded characters permanent Essence. The character
        does not absorb the essence a it just dissipates. If a
        spirit is destroyed by a Spirit-Shredding Arrack it is
        irrevocably gone.
        This Charm is explicitly permitted to be part of a
        Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Handling the mysteries of sorcery is a much more
        difficult endeavor for Terrestrial Exalted than for the
        Anathema. The enchantments of the Celestial and Solar
        circles are far beyond the grasp of the Dragon-Blooded.
        However, sorcery of the Terrestrial Circle is available to
        them, assuming this Charm is learned.&lt;br&gt;
        Note that invoking this Charm only enables the
        character to cast a single Terrestrial Circle sorcery spell.
        The actual spell itself has an Essence cost, often very high,
        that the character must pay to actualize it. This cost is
        listed in the spell's description. Terrestrial Circle Sorcery
        can never be part of a Combo.

            All Dragon-Blooded can harmonize themselves
            with the elemental pole with which they share aspect
            in order to orient themselves. Study, in ages past, of
            the mechanism of this phenomenon provided the
            inspiration for a number of techniques by which Terrestrial
            Exalts could learn to harmonize their Essences
            in other ways. Most common of these techniques is
            this Charm, which allows harmony with the Magical
            Material of the Dragon-Blooded: jade. This Charm is
            a staple of surveyors, criminals and the Jade Sniffers of
            the Thousand Scales.&lt;br&gt;
            A character using this Charm can sense the direc-
            tion to jade of her elemental aspect up to a range of her
            Essence x 200 yards without rolling. Successes on a
            Perception + Occult roll allow the character to glean
            more detailed information from the Charm, with each
            success allowing for either the perception of another
            of the four remaining elemental forms of jade or a
            rough indication of the amount of an already-detected
            quantity of jade.&lt;br&gt;
            This Charm is ineffective against jade that is
            attuned to someone other than the character using
            the Charm, due to the interference of the attuned
            individual's anima. Jade that is on the person of
            someone using magic to conceal his presence or in a
            site that has had such magic worked on it will only be
            detected if the Perception + Occult roll succeeds
            versus a difficulty equal to the successes rolled to
            activate the obfuscatory magic or the Essence of the
            character using the magic (whichever is higher).

            &lt;br&gt;
            With much of the documentation lost on how
            magical artifacts were crafted in the First Age, modern
            savants must often reverse engineer items as best they
            are able in order to better understand how to recreate
            or service them. Additionally, many artifacts of mod-
            ern make are one-of-a-kind constructions, and it is
            safest to have the fullest possible knowledge of an
            unfamiliar item before attempting to work with it. To
            this end, Terrestrial technicians have learned to apply
            the sensory techniques of Essence-harmonizing to
            better analyze the fundamental material construction
            and Essence-channeling of artifacts.&lt;br&gt;
            To enact this Charm, the character must handle
            the item in question as if he were attempting to
            attune to it before spending the required Essence and
            before his player makes a Perception + Occult roll
            with a difficulty of the item's Artifact rating. Arti-
            facts specifically designed so that their properties are
            difficult to identify may have a higher difficulty.
            Success on this roll immediately gives the character
            a rough indication of the item's power level, as
            reflected by the Artifact rating, with additional suc-
            cesses providing more detailed insight about the
            specific abilities of the item. Very powerful or complex
            artifacts may require multiple uses of Seeing the
            Maker's Hand over time to fully understand their
            workings. This Charm is ineffective on artifacts that
            are attuned to an owner.

            Sorcery and magical engineering are inherently
            dangerous undertakings, as many crippled former
            Heptagram servants can attest. The slightest misstep
            when summoning a demon or miscalculation in Manse
            design can have spectacular and fatal consequences
            for everyone in the area. Diligence is, of course, the
            most important habit to develop to avoid these is-
            sues, but the frequency with which dangerous magic
            must be worked in the Realm means that it is often
            only a matter of time before a disaster occurs. High-
            end professional magical practitioners use this Charm
            as one of many safeguards against terrible accidents,
            in addition to the obvious advantages of straightforward
            mastery of a particular discipline.&lt;br&gt;
            This Charm allows a character to convert his
            Occult specialty dice into automatic success for 2
            motes of Essence per die converted. This only works if
            the character is exercising his specialty.&lt;br&gt;

        Invoking this Charm allows a Dragon-Blooded to

        in the air. The character may move and act in total
        darkness or with her vision fully impaired with no penalties,

        discern information that requires vision rather than perfect
        spatial awareness. While this sense is not precise
        enough to be completely effective in combat, but it does
        reduce the penalties for fighting blind by half.

        This Charm eliminates the noise of any action taken
        directly by a character under its influence. Gravel crunches
        silently underfoot. A sword swung by the character would
        glance off an opponent's shield with no sound. This effect
        lasts for one minute per mote of Essence invested. This
        Charm provides no direct benefit to Stealth rolls, but many
        actions will no longer have any chance of attracting attention,
        and there should be no difficulty penalties for moving
        through areas full of potential sources of accidental noise.&lt;br&gt;
        Keep in mind that the noise suppression only applies
        to those actions directly taken by a Dynast. She could put
        her fist through a window with no noise being created by
        the breaking glass, but the glass would tinkle as it fell to the
        floor, and if she instead threw a rock at it, the crash would
        be clearly audible.&lt;br&gt;
        The individual under the influence of this Charm is
        unable to speak while Soundless Action Prana is in
        effect. She may communicate through any other method,
        however.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By stilling the air to the point where it ceases to
        transmit sound at all, an Air-aspected Exalt may ensure
        that whatever mayhem ensues, the sounds of it will not
        reach the ears of others. A Zone of Silence suppresses all
        sound at all within its reach, be it the ringing of blades or
        the desperate cries of wounded enemies. One could vivisect
        a yeddim with a dull hatchet and someone standing a
        few feet away would be none the wiser — or at least their
        ears would not inform them of the deed. The character
        invoking the Charm is advised to say anything she feels
        necessary before the Charm is invoked, since no normal
        sound communication can take place within a Zone of
        Silence. Dynasts favoring this Charm are advised to learn
        sign language or a Charm such as With One Mind instead.&lt;br&gt;
        The Zone of Silence extends a number of yards equal
        twice the Exalted's permanent Essence. Each extra mote of
        Essence invested into the Charm increases the radius of
        effect by a single yard, but a character cannot spend more
        motes of Essence to increase the area of effect than her
        permanent Essence. Burglars and assassins often invoke
        this Charm to suppress sound in an entire dwelling, so they
        may work without worry of an alarm being raised. The
        Zone of Silence moves with the character.

        With this Charm, the character uses the wind to cause
        minor disturbances and distractions to those who might
        observer her passage. Whether it be a tickling wind in the
        ear, a suddenly guttering torch or a knocked over spear,
        this minor enchantment can ensure a Dynast slips by even
        the most observant eyes without being spotted.&lt;br&gt;
        Every mote of Essence invested in this Charm acts as
        2 automatic successes against a single target that might
        detect the Exalt's presence. The Charm can be directed at
        more than one target at once, so long as the proper amount
        of Essence has been paid.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Cynestia, an Air-aspected Dynast,
        wishes to sneak past a cave entrance occupied by three
        Wyld barbarians. Her player spends 3 motes of Essence to
        give her two automatic successes in her Dexterity +
        Stealth rolls for Cynestia to avoid notice by all three
        barbarians. If Cynestia encounters other characters during

        additional dice to evade their notice as well, but cannot
        distract more than three characters at a time. If the player
        had spent 4 motes, Cynestia could distract an additional
        barbarian, but could not give herself four automatic
        successes to avoid notice by one of them.&lt;br&gt;
        The character must not be visible or otherwise easily
        detectable when this Charm is activated. However, even
        a moment out of sight is long enough to invoke it and gain
        the benefits. This Charm does nothing to conceal a Dynast's
        passage, and she maybe tracked as normal. A character
        cannot spent more motes on the use of this Charm than
        her permanent Essence.

        Simply avoiding guards is often not enough to remain
        truly undetected. This Charm summons up subtle but
        useful air currents that conceal the traces of the passage of
        the character and his associates, obscuring: footprints,
        obliterating scents and weeping away telltale broken
        branches and twigs.&lt;br&gt;

        tracking attempts are subject to a standard tracking
        contest. The Dragon-Blooded invoking the Charm may
        extend it to protect as many beings as he has points of
        permanent Essence.

        By invoking this Charm, the character gains the
        ability to move normally along any roughly horizontal
        surface - even those normally impossible to cross. Walk-
        ing across mud, quicksand, even water is easy with this
        Charm in place. The Charm also instills perfect balance
        and excellent timing, giving the character the facility to
        easily scamper across ropes, poles, beams, scaffolding and
        the like with no movement penalties.&lt;br&gt;
        The wind walker may move normally in all respects
        across such surfaces, including jumping, rolling, crawling
        — however he wishes to move. However, the character
        must keep moving. If even a single turn is spent standing
        still for whatever reason, the Charm's magic is broken. The
        hero can carry all of his normal gear and up to his own
        weight in additional burdens. Any greater weight also
        immediately breaks the Charm.

        With true mastery of the art of stealth comes the
        power to almost completely shroud oneself from the eyes
        of others. Invoking the Dragon Shroud wraps the air itself
        around a character, concealing her even in broad daylight.
        While Dragon Shroud does not render a character truly
        invisible, her form is blurred and indistinct. Light seems to
        bend around her, making her much more difficult to see
        even if the observer knows she is there — and nearly
        impossible if he does not. The Dragon Shroud also muffles
        sound, masks scent, suppresses body heat and generally
        does its best to foil any attempt to clearly view the Dynast
        This is not true invisibility, however. A careful (or lucky)
        observer can still spot a blurry disturbance in the air where
        the Dragon-Blood stands.&lt;br&gt;
        Every 3 motes invested in this Charm act as one
        automatic opposing success to any action taken against
        character that requires that she be seen, heard or perceived
        with any of the five senses, including attempts to attack
        the character or to spot her when she is sneaking. It also
        quite effectively masks a Dragon-Blooded's identity. The
        Charm has no lingering effects, however, and the character
        can be tracked as normal.

            &lt;br&gt;
            There are situations and environments where
            moving unnoticed is preferable to moving unseen,
            and in many of those cases, failing to look inconspicuous
            can be far less damning than failing to hide. There
            are also simply scenarios where the best option for
            stealth is to look like you belong there, like part of the
            scenery. A Dragon-Blood who uses this Charm can,
            using Essence to make his body language resonate
            with his surroundings, walk down any street or hall,
            and anyone watching will simply fail to find anything
            noteworthy or out of place about him. Watchers in a
            court might assume the character is a page, think him
            a functionary while in an office or believe he's a
            soldier in a military camp.&lt;br&gt;
            Any rolls to take note of the character are at a
            difficulty equal to his Stealth Ability, though this
            difficulty may be lowered if the character engages in
            very outlandish or attention-grabbing behavior. A
            character using this Charm can, for 1 additional mote
            per ally, include others in the effect, up to a maximum
            number of people equal to his Essence.

            &lt;br&gt;
            Stealth is more than a subtle gait and the ability
            to remain still. There are a great number of mind
            games involved in going unnoticed: speed of movement,
            gait, body language, clothing choices,
            misdirection, capitalizing on distractions and more.
            These techniques and considerations, when mastered
            can be applied to more specific and specialized types of
            subterfuge. This Charm is such a specialized application:
            The aim of the Dragon-Blood is not to conceal
            herself, but to conceal what she is carrying or manipulating
            with her hands.&lt;br&gt;
            A character using this Charm can conceal an
            object that is no larger than half her size and not
            heavier than can be easily carried in two hands.&lt;br&gt;
            Alternately, she can completely conceal what she is
            doing with her hands by allowing her Essence to
            guide her actions to make sure that observers have no
            line of sight to the object or activity concealed. The
            Essence cost for this Charm is 1 mote per minute per
            subject from whom the object or activity is concealed
            from sight, up to a maximum of the character's
            Essence + Manipulation.&lt;br&gt;
            When concealing an object, the character can
            take any action she wishes without ending the Charm,
            including talking with or even embracing one of the
            targets, so long as she takes no action using the
            concealed object. Taking any action using the concealed
            object ends the Charm. Attacking with a
            weapon that has been concealed through the use of
            this Charm will, in most cases, surprise the target.

            mastery of the art of stealth in a particular
            environment or set of circumstances — or, possibly,
            when stalking a favored class of prey.
            The character's Stealth specialty dice may be
            converted into automatic successes for 3 motes of
            Essence per die converted. The remainder of the pool
            is rolled normally. This Charm only functions if the
            character is applying the specialty.

            With this level of skill, a Dragon-Blood can accomplish
            with the most minimal or sudden of
            movements what would normally be a deliberate and
            careful attempt at stealth. Masters of this Charm can
            accomplish such feats as hiding in an opponent's
            shadow during combat, vanishing quietly to cover
            when an attacker blinks or assaulting someone on a
            busy street and easily making a stealthy escape. This
            powerful Charm permits the character to make a
            reflexive Stealth roll, even if others are directly observing
            him.

            Through this Charm, a Dragon-Blooded character
            charges any convenient stick or scrap of wood with Essence.
            When he then throws the Essence-charged wood, it
            flies through the air as smoothly as an arrow from a bow —
            and does as much damage. The character rolls Dexterity +
            Thrown, and the improvised missile inflicts damage based
            on its shape — most are point, fowling or frog crotch. The
            weapon has the same range increment as a compound bow.&lt;br&gt;
            Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
            • When the character achieves greater throwing skill,
            she could improve the range or damage of the arrow.
            Alternatively, she might Combo the Charm with Archery-based
            Charms.&lt;br&gt;
            • A character with a higher Essence rating might gain
            the ability to harm spirits with this Charm, or multiply the
            improvised missile's effect in various ways. (See the Archery
            and Thrown Charms for Solars in Exalted for
            inspiration, but tone down their effect and increase the
            Essence costs for Dragon-Blooded characters.)&lt;br&gt;
            • For a variation, a character might have a Charm
            enabling her to use any convenient scrap of wood as a
            melee weapon.

        Close alignment with the element of Air considerably
        simplifies the task of hurling deadly objects at opponents.
        With an infusion of Essence, the Dragon-Blooded forges a

        This Charm allows an Exalt to ensure that a particularly
        valuable weapon (or weapons) will return safely to
        her hand. When she first hurls the weapon, the Dynast
        attaches an invisible rope of wind to it, pulling it back to
        her hand when it's path is spent. Whether it hits its target
        or not, a Loyal Weapon instantly flies back through the air
        to the character's hand, available for use next turn.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm works on any weapon at all, not just those
        usually thrown. A daiklave may be hurled as easily as a
        group of shuriken. Melee weapons thrown using this Charm
        have the same accuracy, speed and damage as they would
        if melee weapons and a range in yards equal to 10 rimes the
        character's Essence; but they use the character's Thrown
        Ability, rather than her Melee.&lt;br&gt;
        Anyone in the weapon's path, other than the target,
        may attempt to grab the weapon as his action, assuming:
        that he has an action available. The weapon can be caught
        with a successful Dexterity. + Athletics roll, but the player
        of the character catching the weapon must succeed at an
        immediate, reflexive opposed Strength + Athletics roll.

        Currents of elemental Air can be used to sustain a
        thrown missile's deadly flight long after its energy would
        normally be spent. The character infuses the Essence of air
        into an item and hurls it at his opponent as normal. But
        unlike a normal hurled attack, this thrown weapon takes
        on a life of it's own, continuing to circle and attack for a
        number of turns equal to the attacking character's Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        A weapon or item enchanted with Persistent Hornet
        Attack strikes a single target each turn with the
        attacking character's Perception + Thrown skill. The
        weapon acts on the same initiative as the character's
        each turn. Once a weapon has been assigned a target,
        the character can't change the target. The weapon can
        be attacked as if it was a normal character, but the
        difficulty to hit it is the throwing character's Essence. If
        struck, the weapon does not soak — it is immediately
        knocked from the air and become inert.&lt;br&gt;
        The character must declare he is invoking this Charm
        when he first throws the weapon it is used on. If the
        attacker uses Persistent Hornet Attack as part of a Combo,
        the daggers must repeat the use of the other Charms in the
        Combo exactly. The character should pay the cost of the
        additional Charms each time the dagger uses them, but
        need not pay the Willpower every turn.

        Attacking with one or more of these waiting weapons
        is a reflexive action that must be done at the same time that
        the character takes his regular action, and it can be done
        in conjunction with any other normal simple action.
        Aside from that fact, it is a normal, reflexive Dexterity
        + Thrown attack, which can be modified by
        Charms as usual. The waiting weapons may be used as
        part of a Combo, but the Combo can only apply to the
        hidden weapons, cannot include an Extra Attacks-type
        Charm and must include every hidden weapon called up
        in the turn.&lt;br&gt;
        There is no limit to the number of weapons concealed
        by the Invisibly Hidden Chakram Method that a Dragon-
        Blood can release in one turn, and each is thrown with the
        Exalt's full Dexterity + Thrown pool at the time of its
        appearance. The hidden weapons originate from the
        character's location and are clearly part of an attack on
        that character's part. A Dragon-Blooded character can
        maintain as many invisibly hidden weapons as his Essence
        Trait x 2. These weapons are as impossible to sense as
        anything hidden Elsewhere.

        Whirling currents of air surround the Exalt, deflecting
        ranged attacks aimed at her. Each time a ranged attack is
        directed at a character using Whirlwind Shield, the
        character's Essence acts as a number of automatic successes
        that are subtracted from any attempt by an attacker to
        make a ranged attack roll against the target.
        This Charm can be used upon a group if the
        character so wishes, but characters so protected must
        remain within range of the character's perception.
        The Exalted must commit an additional mote per
        companion so protected.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Beyond just deflecting an enemy's attack, Vengeful
        Gust Counterattack lets a character strike back at the one.
        assaulting her. Upon being made the target of a ranged
        attack that she is aware of, the player of a character that.
        knows this Charm may make an immediate Dexterity +
        Thrown check as an opposed defensive roll in place of a
        dodge or parry attempt.&lt;br&gt;
        If this roll exceeds the attacker's roll, the missile's path
        is reversed. It is hurled back to its point of origin, striking
        with a number of successes equal to the extra successes on
        the defending character's player's Dexterity + Thrown roll.
        This Charm is not an all-or-nothing proposition.
        Even if the defender fails to score extra successes on her
        Dexterity + Thrown roll, she still subtracts the successes
        she got from the attacker's roll, just as if the character was
        dodging or parrying the attack.&lt;br&gt;
        If the Exalt has Whirlwind Shield Form active when
        she activates Vengeful Gust Counterattack, the character's
        Essence is subtracted from the atrack before the results of
        the Dexterity + Thrown roll are applied to it, allowing
        stronger counterattacks. If the character is the target of an
        area-of-effect attack such as the Death of Obsidian Butterflies,
        the Whirlwind Shield Form protects only her own
        person, but the attack can still be deflected. This means
        that, for example, a sorcerer who targets multiple Air-aspected
        Dragon-Blooded with such a spell may be struck
        multiple times with its effect due to this Charm.

        Once sufficient connection with the Air Dragon has
        formed, the skilled Dragon-Blooded can move beyond
        even the need for a weapon to throw at his opponent. By
        infusing the air itself with Essence, the character solidifies
        it, forming indistinct yet glittering patterns of icy wind — weapons
        from the very substance of air itself. Such insubstantial
        weapons are too unstable for melee combat, but
        they are eminently suited for ranged attacks.&lt;br&gt;
        A wind weapon has a base damage and accuracy equal
        to the character's permanent Essence and a range equal to
        10 times this value. It is also possible to create more than
        one wind weapon at once, so long as the Essence cost is
        paid for each. The maximum number of weapons that can
        be created in a single turn with this Charm is equal to the
        character's permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        Once created, the wind weapon is thrown as a reflexive
        action, using the characters Dexterity + Thrown, plus
        the accuracy of the weapon and any appropriate modifiers
        for ranged attack. If multiple weapons are created, they
        are all thrown at once and can be thrown at one or at
        multiple targets. The wind weapons can't be handed to
        anyone else or used in melee combat. This Charm cannot
        be put in a Combo with Extra Action type Charms, If the
        character throws multiple wind weapons, each is thrown at
        his full dice pool.&lt;br&gt;
        Wind Weapons have real substance for the Charm's
        short duration and can be used for purposes other than
        simple attacks. For instance, a wind knife can sever a rope
        or knock an item out of someone's hand as easily as any
        other thrown knife can.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By further refining the control needed to form a
        Whirlwind Shield, the character learns to form invisible
        armor from the surrounding air. While a Whirlwind Shield
        only protects against ranged weapons, Wind Armor Technique
        forms a barrier to any assault upon the character.&lt;br&gt;
        The Wind Armor has a 1B/1L soak rating for every
        mote of Essence committed to it and has no mobility
        penalty or fatigue value. Wind Armor appears as a cocoon
        of violently swirling winds surrounding the character
        invoking it. The maximum rating of this armor is the
        character's permanent Essence. This armor is fully com-
        patible with and additive to physical armor.&lt;br&gt;
        Wind Armor Technique can also be used on others,
        but they cannot move farther than 5 x the Exalt's permanent
        Essence in yards away, or the effect immediately
        fades. The use of this Charm on others is at the normal
        price - one mote per 1L/1B of the armor — and must be
        spent for every target armored.

            &lt;br&gt;
            This is the first of what are collectively known as
            the Crosswind Techniques, a group of Charms predicated
            on emulating and channeling Essence in a
            manner similar to the Essence within the very wind,
            first taught centuries ago by their creator,
            &amp;quot;Windtamer&amp;quot; Cynis Mond. The eccentric innovator
            no longer teaches the Techniques he once claimed
            were mere by-products of his other studies of the
            Essence of the winds, but the collection of Charms is
            so widespread today that instruction is available
            practically anywhere.&lt;br&gt;
            The Crosswind Offense is a technique by which a
            Terrestrial may imbue both weapon and throw with
            windlike Essence in order to guide the throw accurately
            in a wide arc instead of a straight line, with the
            purpose of bypassing a shield or cover with a lateral
            attack. This technique costs 1 mote of Essence per
            difficulty penalty due to shields or cover bypassed.

            &amp;quot;One: As the wind shepherds a leaf, shepherd the
            target. Two: As the wind drives the rain, drive your
            weapon to the target.&amp;quot; These are Windtamer's words
            on the subject of this Charm, often quoted by teachers
            of this technique. Activating this Charm, the Exalt
            uses a feinted attack to trick a target into dodging into
            a second attack, the true attack.&lt;br&gt;
            To use this Charm, the attacking character
            splits his action into two actions. The player rolls
            one attack using his character's Manipulation +
            Thrown at -2 dice with a difficulty of 1. If this
            attack is successful, it does no damage, but instead,
            note the extra successes rolled on the attack. The
            second action is a normal Dexterity + Thrown
            attack at -3 dice. The extra successes on the first
            roll reduce the target's dice on any attempts to
            dodge the second throw.

            Learning to more fully emulate the Essence of
            wind, a Terrestrial with this Charm can throw her
            weapon with the terrible force of hurricanes, sending
            her target flying through the air.&lt;br&gt;
            The attack is rolled normally, a successful hit
            does damage as usual and also knocks the target back
            (the attacker's Essence + attack successes) yards.
            This attack may be blocked and dodged as usual,
            though a block is only useful against the damage, not
            the knockback.

            behind the Crosswind Gale technique, a Dragon-Blood
            utilizing this Charm may imbue his thrown
            weapons with highly concentrated, windlike Essence.
            Weapons thus empowered are only vehicles for this
            pure force, which will find its way through even the
            smallest chink in the target's armor. Attacks made
            using this Charm are treated as piercing attacks, halving
            the target's lethal armor soak.

        Speech requires breath, the very air of life. Some
        Dynasts of Air can extend their senses through the air and
        so listen to what people say far away. The farther away a
        character wants to eavesdrop, the more difficult the Charm
        becomes: For a simple success, an Aspect of Air can clearly
        hear normal speech from a hundred feet away. The character
        also gets a general sense of the target's direction (assuming
        she doesn't know already). For each additional point of
        difficulty, that range increases by a factor of ten. For each
        additional dot of Essence the character has, the base distance
        increases by a factor of ten. A powerful Air-attuned lord can
        - with great difficulty — hear voices throughout the world.
        (The Empress certainly seemed to have this knack.)&lt;br&gt;
        This Charms comes with limitations. The character
        must specify a single person he wants to spy upon: He
        cannot, for instance, declare that he will &amp;quot;listen for people
        plotting against me.&amp;quot; At most, he can make a list of
        suspected enemies and eavesdrop on them one by one. The
        character cannot hear anything spoken in an airtight
        chamber. Many of the powerful Dynasts build such cham-
        bers for their privy councils, specifically to defeat this
        Charm. Finally, listening to a person from so far away
        demands total concentration: The character cannot per-
        form any other action while hearing voices on the wind.
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A more powerful Charm could have a longer dura-
        tion, allowing a character to listen in on another character
        for a full hour, or even longer — but still only one person
        at a time.&lt;br&gt;
        • Alternatively, the character can listen to any
        conversation or other noises at a specific location far away.
        In this case, the character must objectively define a precise
        spot (such as &amp;quot;the kitchen in Lord Peleps' villa&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;the
        interior of that carriage down the street&amp;quot;).

        While under the aegis of this Charm, the character
        cannot be surprised by any means, magical or otherwise.
        This doesn't make her able to see the invisible or anything
        of the sort. It just means that she cannot be struck by an
        attack she is not aware of.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm can be extended to the character's companions
        by merely spending 2 extra motes per person to be
        so affected. All-Encompassing Earth Sense is not effective
        unless the character is standing on the ground. She need
        not be touching the earth itself - the Charm functions
        just fine inside structures, etc. — but may not be flying,
        swimming and so forth. Engaging in any of these activities

        picture includes living beings. Further successes refine the
        image. One success might yield, &amp;quot;The next room is about
        10 x 10 with three humanoid beings in it.&amp;quot; Three successes
        might impart, &amp;quot;The next room is obviously a guardroom,
        containing three Wyld barbarians, each carrying a large
        stone club.&amp;quot; Five successes would yield all of the above
        information, plus estimates of the various strengths of the
        three barbarians, what armor they are wearing and exact
        details on where they are standing.&lt;br&gt;
        To be properly sensed, an object or being must actually
        be touching the earth or touching something directly
        touching the earth in some fashion Objects floating in the
        air or immersed in water would not be affected for instance.
        The range of this Charm is doubled for every additional
        mote of Essence spent. This Charm is especially
        effective underground or in all stone structures, since they
        are actually embraced by the earth. Double the range while
        using the Charm, in such circumstances, and all details of
        the surrounding areas are perceivable.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Earth is the most static and quiescent of the elements,
        and while it's all encompassing nature enhances the awareness
        of the Earth-aspected Dragon-Bloods, it also allows
        them to suppress this awareness in others.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm enables a Dragon-Blooded character to
        infuse some of stone's somnolent stasis into another person's
        mind, putting them to sleep. Some Dynasts work this
        Charm by speaking in a low, droning voice; others prefer
        to use a glittering gemstone, such as the jewel in a ring, to
        fix their victim's attention and convey the flow of Essence.
        The character can only bury someone's mind if she can
        keep them sitting still for five minutes, so this Charm calls
        for a fair bit of guile.&lt;br&gt;
        The Dragon-Blood's player rolls Manipulation + Presence,
        with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Simple
        success causes the target to sleep for an hour, and each
        extra success adds one hour to the total. During that time,
        nothing, not noise, light or movement, will awaken the
        victim. You could send the entire Red-Piss Legion past
        with clashing cymbals, and he wouldn't wake up. At the
        end of this period, the victim passes into normal slumber.&lt;br&gt;
        While in the grip of magic sleep, the victim dreams
        strange, still dreams of the caves beneath the earth and the
        mysteries within them. Once in a while, someone wakes up
        afterward knowing where to dig a well that never goes dry
        or the location of a deposit of ore.

        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Precision Observation Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        A Dragon-Blood truly in tune with the world can
        project her sense into others, riding along and perceiving:
        things from a great distance.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is actually three separate Charms, together
        encompassing all of the five senses. The target must
        be visible to the character when the Charm is activated but
        may leave the character's sight after the activation. The
        maximum range at which these Charms function is the
        character's permanent Essence in miles.&lt;br&gt;
        When activated, a roll is made; pitting the Dynast's
        Awareness + Essence against the target's in a reflexive
        opposed roll. The Dynast needs but a single success to
        invoke the Charm. If the Dynast ties the target, there is no
        effect. If the target is an Exalted and beats the Dragon-
        Blood, his player gers to make a reflexive Awareness roll
        with a difficulty of 3 to sense that someone was trying to
        Sense Ride him. Players of normal mortals get no such roll,
        and they remain unaware of the enchantment.&lt;br&gt;
        While Sense Riding, a character may not take any sort
        of disruptive action whatsoever. It is best to sit quietly and
        just observe the sense ridden. Simple actions such as sitting
        on a slowly walking horse may be possible at the Storyteller's
        option, but the character may be in danger of missing
        important details of what is being observed. If the target is
        injured (takes any health levels of damage) while being
        sense ridden, the character takes an unsoakable level of
        bashing damage, and the Charm is disrupted.&lt;br&gt;
        The effects of riding each sense are detailed below:&lt;br&gt;
        Sight: The character may perceive anything the target
        sees, including any magical enhancements that the target
        applies to his own senses while the character is &amp;quot;riding&amp;quot; him.
        The character may only observe through the ridden target's
        eyes. The character cannot use Charms or sorcery or other-
        wise affect the world around the target through the channel
        of the shared sense, though it might provide targeting
        information for some other sort of attack.&lt;br&gt;
        Hearing &amp;amp; Touch: The character may perceive
        anything the target hears or touches, including any magi-
        cal enhancements that the target applies to his own senses
        while the Exalt is &amp;quot;riding&amp;quot; him. This perception does not
        give the Dragon-Blooded the ability to understand languages
        she doesn't know, even if the person being ridden
        understands them.&lt;br&gt;
        Smell &amp;amp; Taste: This Charm is probably the least used
        of the three, but a truly thorough Dynast may wish to leam
        it. When combined with the other three Charms, it
        provides a complete picture of the target's environment
        and surroundings. As with the other (Sense)-Riding
        Charms, the character may perceive anything the target
        does with his sense of smell and taste, including any
        magical enhancements that the target applies to his own
        senses while the character is &amp;quot;riding&amp;quot; him.

        Minimum Awareness: 4&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: (Sense)-Riding Technique for the appropriate sense&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is a cluster of three Charms just like
        (Sense) Riding Technique, and it functions in much the
        same way. However, instead of tapping into the target's
        senses, the character simply shuts them down. When this
        Charm is activated, the Dynast's player makes an Essence
        + Awareness roll with a difficulty equal to the target's
        Perception. The effects for each sense are detailed below.&lt;br&gt;
        Sight: Each extra success subtracts one die from the
        target's Awareness rolls relating to sight and adds a -1
        penalty to any task involving sight. If the character's extra
        successes exceed the target's Perception, the target is
        blinded completely for the Charm's duration.&lt;br&gt;
        Hearing &amp; Touch: Each success subtracts one die
        from the targer's Awareness rolls relating to these senses
        and allows him to ignore one level of wound penalties. If
        the character's roll exceeds the target's Perception, the
        target is rendered completely deaf but also suffers no
        wound penalties for the Charm duration. Some enterprising
        Dynasts use this Charm on their minions before
        sending them into combat — but are careful to give them
        explicit instructions before doing so.&lt;br&gt;
        Smell &amp; Taste: Each success subtracts one die from
        the target's Awareness rolls relating to these senses. If the
        Exalt gains more successes than the target's Perception, he
        is rendered completely unable to smell or taste for the
        Charm's duration.&lt;br&gt;
        A Dynast may not use this Charm on herself.

        Minimum Awareness: 5&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 4&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: All three (Sense) - Destroying Method Charms&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        After perfecting the art of suppressing another's physical
        sense, a truly skilled Earth-aspected Dynast can actually
        use his own Essence to suppress his victim's ability to
        perceive and manipulate Essence. The character must pay
        the base cost of the Charm, plus any additional motes. The
        maximum number of additional motes that the Exalt can
        spend is equal to her permanent Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        Her player then makes an Awareness + Essence roll with
        a difficulty of 3 for the Exalt to correctly judge the patterns of
        Essence around the target, who must be insight and no farther
        away than 10 x the character's permanent Essence in feet. If
        the roll succeeds, the player makes a Willpower + Essence roll
        against a difficulty of the target's Essence. Each extra success
        on this toll adds I mote to the cost of all Charms and sorcery
        used by the target, to a maximum penalty equal to the amount
        of extra Essence the character spent activating this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        This surcharge applies to.every activation ofa Charm,
        meaning it may be paid multiple times per turn if an Exalt,
        for example, uses reflexive defensive Charms, If Combos
        are involved, then the surcharge is applied to every Charm
        in the Combo, every time one of those Charms is activated.
        The effects of the Charm linger for a number of
        turns equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence.

            the new results over the old. The Dragon-Blood cannot

            Unfailing Dragon Glance is part of a Combo, Essence
            must be spent to reactivate all the other Charms in that
            Combo when the reroll takes place. If those Charms
            have separate dice rolls associated with them, they are
            not rerolled.

            &lt;br&gt;
            Upon activating this Charm, cataracts like white
            jade cloud over the character's eyes, and he becomes
            blind for the duration of the effect. In exchange, the
            Dragon-Blood gains a preternatural awareness of vibrations
            echoing through the air and ground. He can &amp;quot;see&amp;quot;
            in any or all directions at once as desired, simultaneously
            perceiving the shape and exact location of all objects
            within half the range of his normal vision or his (Awareness
            x 10) yards, whichever is less. Beyond this range,
            objects and sounds blur together and have no coherent
            meaning. Darkness and environmental conditions impairing
            true vision do not normally hinder the &amp;quot;vision&amp;quot;
            granted by this Charm, although magical obfuscations
            and effects that muffle sound may create regions of
            murky vision. Within a radius of (Awareness + Essence)
            yards, the character can even see through and around
            thin walls and other blocking physical obstructions by
            sensing the vibrations passing through the interrupting
            objects. Thick walls obscure and disrupt echoes too
            much to allow vibration sight to peer around them
            without a substantial crack or flaw through which sounds
            can flow. This omnidirectional perception makes the
            character difficult to surprise, adding one automatic
            success to all Awareness rolls made to avoid ambush.&lt;br&gt;
            Despite the obvious utility of sensing vibrations, the
            sense is not sight and cannot fully replace vision. Vibrations
            do not convey colors or shades, making it impossible
            to read or otherwise notice exclusively visual information.
            Characters can recognize people and objects they
            have &amp;quot;viewed&amp;quot; with vibration sight previously, using
            their memory of profiles and surface contours.&lt;br&gt;
            Dragon-Blooded who know this Charm can reflexively
            spend four additional experience points as insurance
            against blindness. Should such characters ever become
            truly blind for any reason (whether temporarily as the
            result of magic or permanently from maiming), they gain
            the full effects of this Charm for the duration of their
            blindness without spending any Essence. This special
            benefit vanishes if a character regains her sight.

            &lt;br&gt;
            The Dragon-Blood concentrates and spends 3 motes
            as a simple action, allowing his consciousness to flow
            down and outward through the Essence currents of the
            earth. For a moment, he experiences the land as an
            extension of his own body and perceives the unnatural
            wounds and blights of all shadowlands and Wyld zones
            within a number of miles equal to his permanent Essence.
            He cannot gauge the strength or direction of these
            tainted regions unless they are within a mile, in which
            case he can determine the rough size, shape and potency
            of the blights. The character can also sense all Manses
            and Demesnes within a mile, but only as wellsprings of
            power. He knows where these sites are and whether they
            are weak (rating 1-2) or strong (3-5), but he cannot
            differentiate between Manses and Demesnes or identify
            a site's type (Earth, Solar, Celestial, etc.). At the end of
            a turn, the mystical perception fades, and the character's
            senses withdraw back into his flesh.&lt;br&gt;
            In addition to the Charm's active use, Pulse of the
            Dragon's Soul activates reflexively for a cost of 1 mote
            whenever a character crosses into a shadowland or Wyld
            zone without realizing it. The Charm does not activate
            itself if the character already knows the nature of his
            location. The character becomes immediately aware of
            the blighted energies of his new location and their
            overall type, but he does not gain the full awareness of
            the surrounding terrain as with conscious activation of
            the Charm.

        Stone-Carving Fingers Form&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: Varies&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: 1 minute&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Craft: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is extremely popular with the Aspects of
        Earth because it forms the prerequisite for so many others.
        It enables the character to split stone with uncanny
        precision. Aside from the usefulness in siegecraft — breach-
        ing walls and the like - the character can make all manner
        of useful items out of stone.&lt;br&gt;
        The character must spend at least a full minute
        carefully striking at the stone. Most characters will use a
        hammer, pick or chisel, but a sword pommel or another
        rock will do just as well. Characters trained at martial arts
        might strike with their bare hands. At the end of the
        minute, the character strikes a final blow — and the excess
        rock shatters, leaving the shape the character wanted.&lt;br&gt;
        The player rolls Wits + Craft. For a simple success, the
        character can quarry stone blocks ready for use in building or
        knock a doorway in a wall. With three successes, he can craft
        an obsidian vase, already hollowed out. For five successes, he
        can produce a portrait statue so realistic that a person might
        mistake it for the actual person, turned to stone.
        The Essence cost of this Charm depends on the
        volume of the finished object: one mote of Essence per
        cubic foot of stone.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • The Dragon-Blooded have developed variations
        where a character picks up a rock, bashes it against something
        hard, and the rock shapes itself into some specific
        useful item. The most common variations produce weapons.
        A character who knows this Charm is seldom disarmed
        for long. The stone weapon remains as strong as a metal
        weapon for a scene, but can break afterward.&lt;br&gt;
        • A cascade Charm much prized by martial artists
        enables a Dynast to shatter large masses of stone with a
        single blow. This is extremely useful in sieges.&lt;br&gt;
        • One variation enables a character to merge bits of
        rock into solid stone. It works just as well on glass, brick or
        pottery. A character could use the Charm to seal doors
        shut with bars of solid rock.&lt;br&gt;
        • Another variation (not requiring Stone-Carving
        Fingers Form as a prerequisite because it's so simple) lets a
        character break an enemy's stone or metal weapon with a
        single well-placed blow. These variations use Brawling,
        Melee or Martial Arts, depending on which way the

        The Terrestrial Exalted's basic and close connection
        with the things of the earth gives them great facility in
        manipulating the rude stuff that makes up the world. The
        most basic trick any Exalted craftswoman learns is that
        tools are, to a large extent, an illusion. It is the force of will
        that drives the act of creation, not the material items one
        uses to shape things.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm bears that out. While the Charm is in
        effect, one of the character's hands may perform the
        function of any one normal tool. The character must
        decide what tool he wants to emulate when the Charm is
        activated. Whether it be a pick axe, hatchet or hammer,
        the Dragon-Blooded's bare hand fulfills the function quite
        nicely. The character takes no damage that a normal tool
        would not normally endure and can perform any normal
        function the tool is capable of - and can use her hand
        normally as well. The Exalt's hand does not take on the
        appearance of the tool in question.&lt;br&gt;
        The shaping hand only emulates the selected tool. If
        the character wants to switch functions, she has to activate
        the Charm again. Both hands can be enchanted separately
        using this Charm.

        Prerequisite Charms: Shaping Hand Style&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is extremely popular with Earth-aspected
        Exalts because it forms the prerequisite for so many others.
        It enables the character to split stone with uncanny
        precision. Aside from its usefulness in siege — craft breach.
        ing walls and the like — the character can make all manner
        of useful items out of stone.&lt;br&gt;
        The character must spend at least a full minute care.
        fully striking at the stone. Most characters will use a hammer,
        pick of chisel, but a sword pommel or another rock will do
        just as well. Characters trained in martial arts might strikes
        with their bare hands. An the end of the minute the
        character strikes a final blow and the excess rock shatters,
        leaving behind the shape the character wanted.&lt;br&gt;
        Roll Wits + Craft. With a simple success, a character
        can quarry stone blocks ready for use in building or knock
        a doorway in a wall. With three successes, she can craft an
        obsidian vase, already hollowed out. With five successes,
        she can produce a portrait statue so realistic that a person
        might mistake it for the actual person, turned to stone.&lt;br&gt;
        The Essence cost of this Charm depends on the
        volume of the finished object: 1 mote of Essence per cubic
        foot of stone.

        The Dragon-Blooded of Earth include some superb
        mountaineers and rock-climbers, many as a result of this
        Charm. Not only may a character using this Charm cling
        to a rock face like a limpet, she leaves indentations in the
        rock that other people can use as hand- and footholds,
        making the climb easier for them. The Earth-aspected
        Exalt literally crafts a ladder out of a sheer rock surface as
        she climbs it.&lt;br&gt;
        The character can climb a sheer stone wall at a rate of
        10 feet per turn, 20 feet or more per turn up a rough cliff-face
        (or a surface where someone already made handholds
        in the rock). No Ability roll is needed. Those following the
        character up the cliff face are considered to have two
        automatic successes for any climbing check.&lt;br&gt;
        Surfaces that are worse than sheer, such as overhangs,
        call for multiple successes.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By simply studying any crafted or created item, object
        or structure, a Dragon-Blooded using this Charm may
        determine that item's weakest point. This knowledge can
        be used to locate and eliminate flaws – or exploited to
        destroy the object.&lt;br&gt;
        To use this Charm, the character must study the
        object in question for at least a full minute. If the Exalt is
        able to handle or touch the thing being studied, the Charm
        costs only a single mote. Studying an object from a distance
        costs 3 motes.&lt;br&gt;
        Once the flaw has been determined, the character
        has two options. If the Dynast wants to try and eliminate
        the flaw, roll her Intelligence + Craft score and
        spend a point of Willpower. If the roll succeeds, the
        object is repaired - this Charm can effect the most
        serious repairs without tools, though something badly
        broken may have many flaws.&lt;br&gt;
        If the character wants to damage the thing in ques-
        tion, the Flaw-Finding Examination is much simpler. The
        next successful physical attack the character makes on the
        target does double normal damage. If the Exalt is targeting
        something such as armor or a weapon, treat it as doubling
        the extra successes of a disarming attempt. If the disarming
        attempt succeeds, the weapon or armor is destroyed.

        Charm of Lesser Unmaking&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Craft: 5&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Flaw-Finding Examination&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Charm of Lesser Unmaking allows a Dynast to
        disassemble an object or structure without actually damaging
        any of its components. An item affected by this Charm
        is broken down into its component pieces.&lt;br&gt;
        For instance, if a Dragon-Blood was to use the
        Charm of Lesser Unmaking on a heavy wooden door
        bound in steel bands, the end result would be a stack of
        timbers, some hammered steel bands and a small pile of
        rivets. Items disassembled in this manner are rendered
        useless until put back together. Enchanted items are
        neutralized until reconstructed, but the Charm does not
        permanently disrupt such enchantments.&lt;br&gt;
        When the Charm of Lesser Unmaking is invoked, the
        character's player makes an Essence + Craft roll. The
        difficulty for this roll is 1 for simply constructed items
        (crudely made stone hatchets, huts lashed together with
        vines), 3 for sturdily or competently made items (a well-
        constructed sword, iron chains, the aforementioned door)
        and 5 for intricately or masterfully made items (a finely
        crafted piece of jewelry, a finely forged weapon). If the item
        in question is enchanted in any way, add i to the difficulty,
        meaning most enchanted items are difficulty 6 to disassemble.
        The maximum volume that a Dynast can affect.
        with the Charm of Lesser Unmaking is equal to her
        Essence in cubic yards.&lt;br&gt;
        Unmaking will hot work on any item that is made in
        one piece (i.e., a vase, stone carving or the like). However,
        it will undo knots and reduce chains to their component
        links. Lesser unmaking is a somewhat time-consuming
        process. The Exalt must also remain in contact with the
        item for a number of turns equal to the unmaking difficulty,
        and it cannot be done as a combat maneuver.

        Minimum Craft: 5&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Charm of Lesser Unmaking&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm functions much like Lesser Unmaking
        but with much more dramatic effects. Rather than just
        being taken apart, an item affected by Greater Unmaking
        is actually reduced back to its raw materials. Sword blades
        melt into hunks of raw iron. Timbers turn to freshly cut
        logs. Glittering gemstones return to their uncut state. Fine
        pottery melts to clay.&lt;br&gt;
        When the Charm is used, roll the character's Essence
        + Craft. This roll is difficulty 1 for normal items constructed
        through standard methods, but difficulty 3 for
        exceptionally crafted or constructed things and 5 for items
        forged from the Five Magical Materials. The Exalt must
        also remain in contact with the item for a number of turns
        equal to the difficulty. The maximum volume that a
        Dynast can affect with the Charm of Greater Unmaking is
        equal to her Essence in cubic yards. This Charm is only
        effective against items made of materials in some way
        derived from the earth.&lt;br&gt;
        Items that are unmade are completely destroyed,
        reduced to their component materials. Whatever is un-
        made must be remade from scratch. The raw materials
        retain any inherent value, of course.

            Not every project can have a top-notch savant on
            hand to oversee it at every stage, and many of the most
            skilled savants are kept far too busy to personally
            attend to every detail of execution, even of the projects
            they do supervise. Through the use of this Charm, a
            savant may produce a detailed and comprehensive
            report and set of instructions that encapsulate the
            research and design phases of a project. This plan may
            then be given to the person or people actually performing
            the work, who will benefit from the expertise
            of the planning savant.&lt;br&gt;
            The character using Diligent Engineer Discipline,
            after familiarizing herself appropriately with the details
            of the proposed undertaking, pays for the
            activation of the Charm and takes the normal amount
            of time to prepare a plan, the player rolling her
            character's Intelligence + Craft at a difficulty of 2.
            Anyone faithfully working from this plan can avoid a
            total number of difficulty penalties during the under-
            taking equal to the number of successes rolled by the
            planning savant. In addition, he cannot fail to at least
            achieve at least minimal success on the finished project
            so long as no circumstances arise that would result in
            difficulty penalties greater than those the Charm's
            effects cancel.

            The Dragon-Blood stamps hard or smites the earth
            with his fist, and a shockwave of Essence and force
            ripples across the ground from the point of impact. This
            shockwave can crudely shape and pack one cubic yard of
            soil for every mote spent, but the continuous structure
            must have at least one edge within a yard of its creator.
            Ramparts of Obedient Earth can only shape soil, but it
            may affect mud, sand and even hard-packed dirt liberally
            strewn with pebbles. The Charm has no effect on solid
            rock of any density.&lt;br&gt;
            Dragon-Blooded chiefly use this Charm on the
            battlefield to quickly erect cover for themselves or others
            (using the standard rules for cover on pages 229-230 of
            Exalted), though creative applications can wreak havoc
            on a cavalry charge and disrupt formations of infantry.
            Anyone unfortunate enough to be standing on the
            ground when it buckles or collapses into a sinkhole
            suffers no damage unless an extremely deep excavation
            prompts an injurious fall, but such characters suffer
            immediate knockdown unless their players make a successful
            Dexterity + Athletics roll at standard difficulty.
            Outside of combat, this Charm has considerable utility
            for excavation work of all kinds, especially since the
            heavy compression of displaced earth allows for the
            creation of extremely stable tunnels. In general, walls of
            packed earth roughly a yard thick have a soak of 5L/8B
            and require 20 health levels to damage and 30 to destroy
            outright. These statistics will fluctuate wildly depending
            on a given structure's thickness and architectural stability.
            Characters may only use this Charm once per turn.

            The Dragon-Blood holds a Hearthstone in his hand
            and crushes the gem in his fist. Such is the power and
            exacting skill of this grip that the stone shatters. Use of
            this Charm requires a Wits + Craft (Jewelry) roll against
            a difficulty of the Hearthstone's rating + 2. A botch
            causes the stone to explode, inflicting dice of unsoakable
            aggravated damage to the Exalt equal to the difficulty of
            the Craft roll. If the character suffers two or more levels
            of damage from a botch, the explosion of Essence also
            costs him the hand holding the gem. On a failure, the
            Hearthstone remains undamaged. Success breaks the
            gem safely, releasing its store of Essence in a surge of
            power. If attuned to the Manse generating the Hearthstone,
            the Exalt regains a number of motes equal to the
            rating of the Hearthstone x 10. If this surge would bring
            his Essence pool above maximum, the excess motes
            bleed into his anima banner as if spent from his Peripheral pool.
            The act of shattering a Hearthstone with this
            Charm manifests as a deafening thunderclap and a flash
            of light brighter than the noonday sun.&lt;br&gt;
            This Charm is chiefly intended to break Hearthstones
            removed from settings. It cannot be used in
            combat or against Hearthstones still in their settings.
            Breaking a Hearthstone has negative effects on the
            geomancy of the Manse. Dragon-Blooded Dynasts
            who use this Charm to cannibalize family Hearthstones
            without an extremely good reason may not be
            permitted to reclaim the gems when they reform.
            Soldiers of Lookshy can expect even harsher sanctions
            from their superiors. Other outcastes may or may
            not suffer social ramifications for use of this Charm,
            depending on who owns the Manse generating the
            Hearthstone they destroyed.

        The Terrestrial Exalted may not be quite as resilient
        as the Anathema they oppose, but they can still take a good
        deal more punishment than normal humans. Like their
        Solar enemies, the Dragon-Blooded may buy extra health
        levels as if they were a Charm.
        Each level of the Dragon-Blooded Ox-Body Technique
        provides one - 1 and one -2 health level. Characters
        cannot take Ox-Body Technique more times than they
        have points of Endurance.

        By simply invoking the strength of the Earth Dragon, a
        Dragon-Blooded using this Charm is able to go without sleep
        for 24 hours without ill effect. The character suffers no penalties
        of any kind during this period due to fatigue from sleep and is
        fully alert. The character still has to rest from physical exertion.
        Using this Charm for more than the character's Essence
        + Endurance days is not recommended. For every
        day past that point, the Exalt loses one temporary Willpower
        per day. This Willpower cannot be recovered until
        he has had at least 24 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

        Stone does not need nourishment, and with this Charm,
        neither do the Dragon-Blooded. A character under the influence
        of this Charm does not need to eat or drink. The Exalted
        functions perfectly well with no nourishment whatsoever and
        suffers none of the penalties associated with hunger.
        Using this Charm for more than the character's Essence
        + Endurance days is remarkably hard on the body. For
        every day past that point, the character loses one bashing
        health level per day, which cannot be healed until use of the
        Charm is discontinued. Most Terrestrial Exalted using this
        Charm for extended periods tend to go without its effects for
        a day or two before reinvoking it.

        The mountains do not breathe, Neither need a Dynast who
        has mastered this Charm. For the rest of the scene after activating
        this Charm, the Dragon-Blooded does not breathe. She can
        survive under water, in clouds of poison gas and in other
        asphyxiating environments with no ill effects whatsoever,
        Keep in mind that, for the duration of the Charm, the
        character is incapable of breathing. This also means that
        speech is out of the question, since the noise of it is caused
        by expelled air. This Charm can be used on others, if they
        are willing. All the character need do to affect a voluntary
        target is to simply touch him.

        the Dragon-Blood's feet touch the earth once every two turns,
        he incurs no fatigue whatsoever from any source, whether it be
        armor, encumbrance, great physical exertion or magical effect.
        This Charm does not relieve fatigue already present when it is
        invoked, however. The Dynast under the influence of the
        Charm also may ignore wound penalties up to his permanent
        Essence rating. If the character does not touch the earth at least
        once every two turns, this Charm is instantly disrupted.

        As well as protecting an Exalted's flesh from harm, the
        steady strength of the Earth Dragon can be used to fuel the
        inner flame of vengeance. This Charm is invoked through
        speaking aloud the terms of the vendetta, to which the
        character commits himself with all his soul: The goal must be
        a simply stated purpose such as: &amp;quot;Find the person who killed my
        father&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Avenge the stain to my honor inflicted upon me
        by the cowardly vassal of the Lord of Singing Birds.&amp;quot;
        Until the terms of the vendetta are fulfilled, the Exalted
        does not need to eat, sleep or rest, so long as he remains in
        pursuit of the vendetta. The character incurs no penalties
        from any sort of fatigue, whether it be magical or natural. He
        will walk tirelessly and fight tirelessly in pursuit of his aim
        and takes no fatigue from armor. He may soak both lethal
        and bashing damage with his Stamina, and he adds his
        Endurance to both his lethal and bashing soaks.&lt;br&gt;
        Unflagging Vengeance Meditation can be sustained without
        ill effect for up to the Exalt's Essence in days. After that, the
        character begins losing one health level of unsoakable bashing
        damage every time his Essence in days passes. The Exalted
        grows pale and draw, his face ser into a mask of vengeance.
        These health levels may be healed only after the Charm is
        allowed to lapse. Healing damage taken from this effect of the
        Unflagging Vengeance Meditation takes twice as longas usual.&lt;br&gt;
        A number of additional characters can join the vendetta
        equal to the Essence of the character initiating the oath. Other
        characters involved must each pay a point of temporary Willpower
        to take the oath. Unflagging Vengeance Meditation ends
        when either the vendetta is satisfied or the individual who
        invoked it consciously stops it. If anyone involved terminates her
        part in the oath prematurely, she takes a number of unsoakable
        levels of lethal damage equal to sum of the permanent Essences
        of the characters involved. This damage may not be reduced in
        any fashion, either with armor or natural protection.

            The Exalt assumes a meditative position and becomes
            perfectly still, clearing his mind of all thoughts as
            he locks his gaze forward without really seeing. The
            character does not actually sleep or dream in this trance
            and regains no Essence for meditating, but remains
            peripherally aware of his surroundings. If the character
            experiences any substantial distraction or interruption,
            he may prematurely and reflexively snap out of his torpid
            reverie to confront the situation. Ignoring the distraction
            and remaining in the trance requires a Temperance
            roll at standard difficulty. If the character goes a full hour
            without leaving the trance, roll one die. Success restores
            one point of Willpower, while a failure or botch indicates
            the meditation provided no real benefit except to
            pass the character's body. Characters may not use this
            Charm more times in a day than their Endurance rating,
            and trances broken by distractions count against this
            limit. Dragon-Blooded with Essence 3+ may explicitly
            use Sleep of Stones Trance to regain Willpower points
            lost by overusing Unsleeping Earth Meditation, allowing
            these disciplined stoics to go indefinitely without
            sleep so long as they regularly meditate.

            The character sinks into deep meditation, opening
            her consciousness and soul to the breath of the Elemental
            Dragons flowing through the world. Whenever the
            character experiences a substantial distraction and after
            each hour that passes, roll her Temperance to maintain
            the trance. The difficulty starts at one and increases by
            +1 after every two successive checks. A failure or botch
            on any of these Temperance rolls breaks the meditation
            and ends the Charm. For each hour the Exalt remains in
            the trance, she recovers (her permanent Essence + 8)
            motes. Hours spent using Breath of Earth Trance refresh
            the soul even better than time spent asleep, possibly
            supplanting the need for sleep altogether. Characters
            using Breath of Earth Trance for at least four consecutive
            hours may regain Willpower with a standard Conviction
            roll, but players of Exalted only receive one Conviction
            roll for their characters to regain Willpower each day
            regardless of the number of hours they sleep or meditate
            with this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
            Breath of Earth Trance only functions within
            Creation. Dragon-Blooded cannot concentrate on
            the Essence of their patrons inside the tainted energies
            of a shadowland or Wyld zone, let alone in the
            Deep Wyld, Malfeas, Autocthonia or the Underworld.
            The sanctums of the little gods and the Celestial
            City of Yu-Shan are considered part of Creation for
            the purpose of this Charm.

            The Terrestrial Exalted calls upon the blood of the
            Elemental Dragons to awaken and cleanse her body of
            dangerous impurities. Liquid Essence glows visibly as it
            spreads through the arteries and veins beneath her skin,
            growing into a web of vibrant pulsing light the color of
            her anima. Characters can use this Charm to completely
            rid themselves of a single disease they have contracted or
            to completely nullify a single toxin currently present in
            their bodies. Once this Charm has purged a disease or
            poison, the character becomes completely immune to
            that impurity and may ignore any and all future exposure
            without a Resistance roll for a number of days equal to
            her permanent Essence. Characters may also use this
            Charm to cleanse all wounds of infection, which also
            serves to make their bodies immune to any infection for
            days equal to Essence. Purifying Blood Ascendancy does
            not aid against magical plagues and poisons. Characters
            may use this Charm while unconscious or otherwise
            incapacitated, making this an effective defense against
            paralytic venom.

        The powerful claws of the Elemental Dragons easily

        emulate this ability, boosting parry prowess with a

        even those made with Abilities other than Martial Arts.
        This bonus is applied to parries made with split dice pools

        also allows the character to make reflexive parries at his
        permanent Essence if he has no other way to parry an
        attack. If he is unarmed, the character may parry lethal
        damage without a stunt.

        the remainder of the scene, the character may do lethal
        damage with her martial arts attacks instead of the normal
        bashing damage, and she may also soak lethal damage with
        her bashing soak. She also adds her permanent Essence to
        her Dexterity or Strength when determining her running
        speed, jumping distance or the amount she can lift or carry.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters cannot use more than one martial arts
        form-type Charm at a time. Using a form-type Charm ends
        the effects of any other form-type Charm the character was

        With a mighty effort, the martial artist channels some
        of the raw fury of the Five Elemental Dragons. The Dynast
        makes a punch or kick attacking using his Dexterity +
        Martial Arts, as usual. This attack does aggravated dam-
        age. The Five-Dragon Fist cannot be placed in a Combo or
        used by a character wielding a weapon — the energy of the
        Five Elemental Dragons must be channeled purely.

        and legs become a blur of motion, and he unleashes an
        unbelievable amount of devastation in the blink of an eye.&lt;br&gt;
        After invoking this Charm, the Dragon Blooded may
        make an extra attack per mote spent, all against a single
        target. All of these attacks are rolled as normal. If the target
        dodges or parries, she makes one roll that is compared to all
        the attacks. The maximum number of extra attacks a
        Dynast can make is equal to his Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        One of the most notable traits of the element of Earth
        is its strength and resistance to damage. Through this
        Charm, a Dragon-Blooded can take on some of the strength
        and hardness of stone and share it with other people.
        After a short meditation spent holding and concentrating
        upon the Essence within a pebble, the character
        becomes stronger and tougher, gaining one dot each of
        Strength and Stamina for the next five minutes. If the
        Dragon-Blooded character wants to include other people
        in the Charm, they must all hold hands in a circle with a
        pebble between each pair of palms. A character can only
        benefit from one application of Strength of Stone Technique
        at a time.

        Swords and arrows glance from her skin as if off a cliff face.
        Every mote of Essence invested in the Charm give the
        character two points of additional soak against lethal and
        bashing damage. The bonus to soak cannot be greater than
        the character's Essence. This Charm is weak against Essence
        and does not apply to damage caused by sorcery or by
        attacks enhanced with Charms.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through this Charm, a Dragon-Blooded character
        links his own Essence to the Essence within any great mass.
        By inverting the principles of resistance against the mass, it
        enables him to exert vastly magnified strength. After a
        moment's concentration, the Dynast can hurl boulders,
        topple pillars, stomp on the edge of a cliff to start a
        landslide or perform other momentary feats of superhuman
        strength. In game terms, for one turn, the character's
        Strength increases by 5, but he can only apply that extra
        Strength to objects made of earth or stone. This height-
        ened Strength may be used in an attack (for instance,
        throwing a boulder at an opponent for Strength-based
        damage), and jade-alloy weapons such as daiklaves are
        &amp;quot;stone&amp;quot; enough to benefit from the effects of this Charm.

        This is actually a cluster of five separate Charms, each
        offering protection from the harmful effects of the element
        of one of Five Immaculate Dragons. While this Charm in
        effect, the character gets a bonus to lethal and bashing soak
        equal to her Essence when attacked by an appropriate
        source of elemental damage. This soak applies to attacks as
        well as to environmental damage (from say drowning;
        crushing rock or molten lava). For the purposes of this
        Charm, metal is earth and fists, teeth and other natural
        attacks are wood. As with Impervious. Skin of Stone
        Meditation, this protection is brittle and offers no additional
        resistance against attacks enhanced with Charms or
        against damage caused by sorcery.&lt;br&gt;
        These Charms must be each bought separately. A
        character may apply the discount for buying Charms of her
        own elemental attunement when learning the protection
        technique for her element.

        the Dynasts of Earth - paragons of stability - have
        developed methods for combating these roiling energies.
        For the remainder of the scene after invoking this Charm,
        a Dynast may ignore the warping effects of the Wyld. Both
        his person and his gear are protected and cannot be
        mutated or changed by Wyld effects. The character can
        extend this protection to others by paying the full cost of
        the Charm and touching them.

        magical attacks made against her by the Anathema. This
        includes both Charm-enhanced attacks and sorcery. These
        are effective automatic successes to avoid the attack and are
        additive with dodges and parries. This Charm offers no
        protection against more subtle effects, such as mind control.

        within his (Essence x 3) yards by paying the same cost, and

            &lt;br&gt;
            Like the lesser (Element) Protection Form upon
            which this Charm builds, Mantle of (Element) Invulnerability
            is actually a cluster of five separate Charms that
            must be purchased separately. Each confers unsurpassed
            protection, allowing the Exalt to completely ignore all
            non-magical sources of injury associated with the respective
            element and adding the character's permanent
            Essence to her soak against magical attacks involving the
            element. This Charm uses the same guidelines for determining
            the elemental association of a damage source as
            (Element) Protection Form (see Exalted: The Dragon-Blooded, p. 201).&lt;br&gt;
            Dragon-Blooded always consider the Mantle of (Element)
            Invulnerability for their own element to be a
            favored Charm, even if they do not actually have Resistance
            as an Aspect or Favored Ability. However, because
            this Charm is still based on Resistance, Earth Aspects
            never pay an elemental surcharge to use any of the five
            elemental permutations.

            The Exalt dons the fivefold aegis of the Elemental
            Dragons, his anima roaring out in a gale of destructive
            power as if he had spent 16+ motes of Peripheral
            Essence. For the rest of the scene, the character is at one
            with the harmony of the elements and suffers no damage
            from any non-magical object or force native to the
            Tapestry of Creation. Beings and forces from outside of
            Fate can hurt the character normally by mundane
            means, but all others must use magically enhanced
            attacks or weapons of the Five Magical Materials to
            harm the Exalt. Unlike the individual Mantle of (Element)
            Invulnerability Charms, Perfected Scales of the
            Dragon offers no additional soak versus damage sources
            that penetrate its limited perfection.

        The Dragon-Blood kneels in humble supplication
        to the Elemental Dragons, briefly setting aside his
        authority as a Prince of the Earth to become a vessel of
        greater divinity. As the Charm activates, a sphere of
        living Essence spreads from the Chosen's heart and
        grows to envelop a radius of her Essence in yards. Taint-Cleansing
        Technique cannot be placed in a Combo but
        may be used synergistically. In order to obtain the
        synergistic benefit, all participant Dragon-Blooded must
        stand in an outward-facing circle with each no more
        than five yards from all other participants. The total
        number of participants cannot exceed the Essence +
        Performance + applicable specialty (usually Leadership)
        of the Exalt leading the combined effort. A
        synergistic use of this Charm combines the spheres of
        Essence from each character into a single sphere emerging
        from the center of the participant circle. This
        sphere has a radius in yards equal to the (highest
        Essence in the group) x (the number of participants).&lt;br&gt;
        Within the radius of the sphere, the energy of the
        Wyld is completely displaced, turning the affected
        area into a bubble of perfect and inviolate stability.
        Every decade of contact with the Wyld erodes one
        foot of radius from the protected region. Fair Folk and
        Wyld mutants can freely enter regions of stability
        created with Taint-Cleansing Technique without suffering
        any more harm than they experience in any
        other part of Creation.

        The Dragon-Blooded of Earth include some superb
        mountaineers and rock-climbers, all because of this Charm.
        Not only does the character cling to a rock face like a
        limpet, she leaves indentations in the rock that other
        people can use as hand- and footholds, making the climb
        easier for them. The character can climb a sheer stone wall
        at a rate of 10 feet per turn, or 20 feet or more per turn up
        a rough cliff face (or a surface where someone already made
        handholds in the rock). Surfaces that are worse than sheer,
        such as overhangs, require multiple successes.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • More skilled Dragon-Blooded can find or make
        projections sufficient to support a hammock. Sleeping 50
        feet up a cliff face may not be comfortable, but with this
        Charm it sure is safe.&lt;br&gt;
        • More powerful Dynasts of Earth can leave a virtual
        ladder or stairway in the rock, making ascent or descent
        quite safe and easy for anyone else.

        Fire does not oppose Earth in the same way that it opposes
        Water, but a glance at a bonfire shows the obvious: Fire abhors
        Earth. With this Charm, a burst of fiery energy propels the Exalt
        from the earth's surface in as much time as it takes a man to take
        just a single step. The Dragon-Blooded may rise from a prone
        or supine position without taking an action to do so. This
        Charm can also be used to add two dice to the Exalted's
        Athletics for the purposes of determining how far she can jump.

        Fire lifts the Exalt's every footstep. The Dragon-Blooded
        with Falling Star Maneuver may jump, tumble, roll or
        outrun a foe in hand-to-hand combat gaining a positional
        advantage that allows him to strike devastating blows.&lt;br&gt;
        Mechanically, this Charm add to dice per mote expended
        to the damage of an attack. No more motes can bespent
        than the character's permanent Essence rating. This damage is
        added before soak is applied. Normally, this Charm can be used
        only with hand-to-hand attacks, but with a stunt, the Charm
        can even be used to gain a bonus to the character's Thrown or
        Archery damage. However, this generally only happens when
        a target has left himself wide open to attacks from the sides and
        the Exalt can reach his flank swiftly. This Charm can explicitly
        be used in Combos with Charms from other Abilities.

        The Exalt can double his movement rate for the scene
        with this Charm. As he does so, he leaves fiery footprints in the
        ground behind him. At a full sprint, he leaves a trail of fire —
        this is normal fire and can cause problems in flammable areas.&lt;br&gt;
        To his own perceptions, he is not moving any faster;
        walking is still walking, and running is still running.
        However, his walk is twice as swift as normal. Resultingly,
        he can move up to (Dexterity + 12) yards and still act in
        a turn and up to (Dexterity x 5) + 25 yards as his only action
        for the turn. This Charm does not increase the character's
        attack speed; it only affects his movement.

        Like a burning ember, the Exalt is propelled away from the
        ground beneath him, so long as he has a surface to guide his feet.
        During any turn this Charm is active, the Dragon-Blooded can
        run up walls, trees and other vertical surfaces as easily as across
        an open courtyard. This is not a casual shuffle - the Exalt must
        get a running start of at least two steps and then run up the wall,
        using his relationship to the rising element of fire to push
        himself away from the earth below. The character's feet do not
        stick to the wall, and he cannot stand on the wall's surface -
        he can only run up it. Similarly, the Dynast may run across the
        surface of water while this power is active, though he cannot
        stop. If he should attempt to run across the surface of dangerous
        liquids, such as lava or acid, he will stay on the surface, but his
        feet may be burned badly.

        The character drifts upward, buoyed by a hot updraft. He
        may move a distance up to nice his ordinary movement rate
        upward, or once he is in the sky, he can move horizontally as
        if he were standing on the ground or ascend or descend as he
        wishes. As with many of the other Charms in this cascade, the
        only restriction is that the Exalt must keep moving; he cannot
        remain still, or he will plunge to the ground. The Dragon-Blood
        can carry as much weight as he can normally lift while
        using this Charm, as determined by his Strength + Athletics.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character's affinity for fire's movement continues to
        grow as he learns this Charm. So long as the Exalt maintains ar
        least a jog — that is to say, moving at least half of his maximum
        running speed he can largely ignore many environmental
        hazards. These include open natural flame, poisonous gas,
        falling rock sand so on. The Dragon-Blood may add 2 to his soak
        against nonmagical environmental hazards for every mote
        spent, up to a maximum of his Athletics score. This ability does
        not protect against magical effects or Charms; however, strong
        elemental effects that come as a result of a character's proximity
        to an elemental pole are considered natural environmental
        hazards and are therefore protected against. This ability acts in
        addition to any anima effect, Charms, sorcery or other protec-
        tions the character may enjoy.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Exalted feels a burning in his veins as he pushes his
        body to its limits. Using this Charm, the Dragon-Blooded
        can improve his Athletics Ability by two dice per mote of
        Essence spent. However, he cannot increase his Athletics to
        more than double its base value. Extra Essence spent is lost.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: If Targan has Athletics 3 and spends 2 motes
        on Fiery Prowess, his effective Athletics becomes 6, not 7.&lt;br&gt;
        The increase in Athletics lasts for a full turn, and the
        character's Athletics dice pool can be split normally while
        under the influence of this Charm.

        The Dragon-Blood with Swift Legion Technique can
        greatly increase the swiftness of his traveling companions
        or allies and himself. The fire at the core of his being
        invigorates and rejuvenates his companions as they move.
        He must choose the subjects of this Charm when he
        activates it and spend 2 motes of Essence for each of them
        (including himself). For the rest of the scene, those characters
        all double their basic speeds, as per Bellows-Pumping
        Stride, above. Because of the malleable nature of time in
        the Exalted system, this Charm can aid long-distance
        travel. A day's travel is usually a single scene. However, if
        the characters' travel is interrupted, the Dragon-Blood
        would have to activate the Charm again. A character
        cannot aid more companions with this Charm than his
        permanent Essence.

        ability to maintain his footing and move gracefully regardless
        of adverse conditions. By becoming more attuned
        to his sense of balance, the Exalt can keep his footing at all
        times and never need worry about falling. Anything he
        could normally do on flat ground, he can do on slick ice, on
        a slanted roof, on a lurching ship's deck or on a wire
        suspended between two towers (while being buffeted by
        winds that would blow lesser men off their feet).

            This Charm reverses the effect of the Forest Passage
            Method and turns it against an enemy. For a short time, the
            local plant life hinders the Dragon-Blooded character's opponent
            any way it can. Branches somehow manage to get in the
            way of his sword arm. Twigs and briars catch at his clothes.
            Even someone fighting on a close-cropped lawn finds his feet
            slipping on the grass. The player rolls Charisma + Dodge. For
            every success, the effect hinders the target for one turn. As a
            result of this hindrance, the Dynast's foe suffers a + 1 difficulty
            penalty on all attack and Dodge rolls, and has his movement
            speed halved. The Dragon-Blooded character can even use
            this Charm to add to natural combat penalties from vegetation.
            The Charm only works against one opponent per use.&lt;br&gt;
            Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
            • One obvious improvement is a Charm that hinders
            every opponent of the Dragon-Blooded character.&lt;br&gt;
            • Another version increases the degree of hindrance,
            or its duration.&lt;br&gt;
            • A still more powerful version could actually trap an
            enemy so that he could not fight at all. This requires fairly
            sturdy vegetation, though — shrubbery or heavy vines at least.&lt;br&gt;
            • Snarling Undergrowth Form and the Forest Passage
            Method are a splendid Combo.

        Fire is the most mobile of the elements. The Dragon-Blooded
        who learn its mysteries can infuse the Essence of
        Fire into themselves or a single target, granting them the
        agility of a leaping flame. The player rolls Wits + Dodge.
        The target gains one dot of the Dodge Ability for every
        success rolled by the Dragon-Blooded character, to a
        maximum of the target's own Dodge rating, for the duration
        of the Charm. The recipient also gains one extra dot
        in Athletics (no more), but only for purposes of jumping
        and keeping his balance. The target cannot more than
        double his Dodge ability, even if multiple Dragon-Blooded
        invoke this Charm on him.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;

        movement rate, allowing the character to move his full
        distance (walking, running or sprinting) while still per-
        forming other actions in a turn.&lt;br&gt;
        • A considerably more powerful Dynast might learn
        to perform an Essence-fueled dodge so agile that she
        becomes impossible to hit by any hand-to-hand attack that
        is not itself reinforced with Essence.

        Ordinarily, when dodging an attack, the defender
        must have ample space in which to move around. The
        character using the Threshold Warding Stance can dodge
        attacks while keeping his balance and leaving his feet in
        one place; as he does so, his torso, arms and legs flicker back
        and forth like a candle flame exposed to high wind. The
        Dragon-Blooded cannot dodge attacks when he is entirely
        immobilized, but so long as he has some degree of freedom
        to move, he can use his full Dodge dice pool. This Charm
        works whether the character is standing on a tree limb, is
        hemmed in by walls on three sides, is up to his shins in
        quicksand or is dangling by his arms from a great height.

        dives to avoid attack become truly pronounced. The
        Exalted with Hopping Firecracker Evasion can move more
        than just a few steps as he avoids attacks. He can leap, dive
        or tumble up to his normal running pace, which is half of
        (Dexterity + 12) yards, when he succeeds in dodging an
        attack. If he is in hand to hand combat, this is likely to
        take him out of handi-to-hand combat range after a single.
        attack, unless the attacker is able to move and continue
        attacking. This effectively allows bim to evade the effects
        of many multiple attack Charms.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This altruistic Charm allows its wielder to move his
        allies out of the way of incoming attacks. When he
        notices an attack coming toward a companion, the
        Dragon-Blood can dive toward that friend and shove him
        out of the way of the attack. The companion must be
        within leaping distance — 5 yards, ordinarily - for the
        Exalt to interpose himself.&lt;br&gt;
        The attack almost always misses the character's companion;
        the Dynast's player should now roll his character's
        own dodge against the attack as though he were its original
        target. If he does not receive enough successes to make the
        attack miss outright, it hits the Exalted rather than his
        original target. However, if the Exalted rolls no successes
        on his dodge, the attack strikes its original target.

        The Exalted conjures up a visual distraction for his
        enemies, allowing his allies to more easily avoid their blows.
        This effect might be smoke, as the Charm's name suggests, or
        it might be the flaring up of a nearby campfire; anything to
        distract opponents and give allies a bonus to dodge. The Exalt
        expends 1 mote of Essence per ally that he wishes to subject
        to this power, plus 1 mote per to dice to be added to the allies'
        Dodge pools. The Dragon-Blood may not contribute more
        dice than he has dots in the Dodge Trait, and his allies cannot
        do more than double their own Dodge Abilities, regardless of
        how many dice are contributed. A character may not use this
        ability on more allies than he has Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Plana has Dodge 3 and Smoke Obscuring
        Effect, and his allies Orbro and Tamota are in a combat with
        him. Orbro has Dodge 2; Tamota has Dodge 5. Plana must
        spend 4 motes of Essence to activate Smoke Obscuring Effect
        (two allies, plus 2 motes for all three of Plana's Dodge dice).
        Orbro receives two bonus dice to his Dodge (since he cannot
        more than double his Dodge Trait), and Tamota receives
        three bonus dice (since that is all that Plana can donate).

        In a fashion similar to Virtuous Negation Defense, the
        Dragon-Blooded moves toward another person as an attack
        is incoming. However, unlike Virtuous Negation Defense,
        this maneuver is intended to cause an attack aimed at the
        Exalted to strike another person - presumably an enemy,
        since the best use of this defense is to let a well-armored foe
        absorb blows on the Exalt's behalf. The new target must be
        within three yards of the Exalted for this Charm to work.
        Rather than rolling a standard dodge, the player should roll
        Dexterity + Dodge, with a total of four successes needed. If
        the roll succeeds, the new target is struck by the attack, and
        the user of this Charm avoids it. Treat the attack as though
        it had been aimed at the new target all along. The new target
        can attempt a dodge himself if he's able to. A character
        cannot force an enemy to attack himself.

        This Charm creates a coruscating aura of fire that,
        radiates for a few feet around the Exalted who activates it.
        The aura destroys any wooden projectiles such as arrows,
        that approach the character; it also weakens the blows of
        other weapons intended to harm him.&lt;br&gt;
        Arrows automatically fail to harm the character, as the
        shaft of the arrow is consumed by fire before the arrow can
        reach him; at most, a harmless arrowhead might bounce off
        the character's clothing or armor. Additionally, the Exalted
        receives +2 to his soak against metal and wooden weapons
        — be they hand-to-hand or ranged attacks — as the blows
        are weakened by their passage through the Arrow-Consuming
        Flame Defense. Only hard stone weapons and gear made
        from the Five Magical Materials are unaffected by this
        Charm. Anyone attempting to make an unarmed against a
        Dragon-Blooded with this Charm active takes 3L fire dam-
        age each time she attacks, soaked normally.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character's talent at avoiding attack and placing
        himself to take advantage of a foe's weakness has been
        honed by this point to allow him to instantly strike back at
        any enemy whose hand-to-hand combat attack he has
        successfully avoided. When attacked at such close range, if
        the attacker fails to achieve any net successes on his attack
        roll (that is, when he either cleanly misses on his own or the
        defender's dodge successes reduce his attack to a miss), the
        defender with Smoldering Karma Strike can spend Essence
        and immediately make reflexive hand-to-hand attack at his
        full dice pool. This Charm cannot be used to respond to a
        counterattack launched with this or any other Charm.

        Perhaps the most difficult of all the Dodge Charms
        known to the Dragon-Blooded, Unassailable Body of Flame
        Defense momentarily turns the character's body into pure
        flame where an enemy's weapon touches it, generally
        allowing the weapon to pass harmlessly through the
        character's body. The Fire Aspect must have his fiery
        elemental anima ignited in order to use this Charm. Only
        then can he become sufficiently attuned to the element of
        fire that he can transform his own body into insubstantial
        flames. In any turn in which the character has used this
        Charm, he can dodge all physical attacks with his full
        Dexterity + Dodge dice pool.

        Just as speech is a form of modulated wind, so thought
        is silent speech. A Dynast of Air can enable a group of
        armsmen to know each other's thoughts, at least to a
        limited degree. What one soldier knows, the others know.
        As a result, a group that fights with one mind displays
        uncanny coordination. They trade opponents without a
        hitch; one fighter parries a blow aimed at another; an
        enemy seen by one cannot hide from any.&lt;br&gt;
        The player rolls Charisma + Melee. For each success
        that the Dragon-Blooded character receives, the recipients
        gain one dot each of Wits, Perception and Melee, up
        the Dragon-Blooded character's own Melee rating. The
        character can link as many people with one mind as she has
        dots of Essence. Typically, this includes the character
        herself, but this is not strictly necessary, Dynasts typically
        use this Charm to magnify the fighting prowess of their
        bodyguards or minions.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters linked by this Charm must have trained
        together for at least a week. They must spend a turn on a
        shared breathing exercise and battle cry to initiate the
        link. The characters must stay within 50 feet of each other.
        If any character moves beyond that range, the link breaks
        and the Charm ends. No character can benefit from
        multiple uses of the One Mind Technique at the same
        time, even if different Dragon-Blooded activate the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • Instead of Melee, an Aspect of Air can leam a
        variation that employs Brawling, Martial Arts or Archery.&lt;br&gt;

        link two characters per dot of Essence, or even more.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character with Dragon-Graced Weapon can
        impart special properties to the melee weapon in hand by
        merely concentrating for a moment. The effect on the
        character's weapon is based on his elemental aspect, as
        described below. This effect is instantaneous; the Exalt
        must pay Essence for every attack, and he must do so before
        making his attack roll.&lt;br&gt;
        Air: Fierce winds surround the weapon, knocking
        your foe off his feet. A successful hit means the enemy takes
        normal damage and her player must succeed at a Dexterity
        + Athletics roll at difficulty 2 or have her character
        knocked prone.&lt;br&gt;
        Earth: A thunderous shaking of the earth accompanies
        the weapon's strike. The enemy loses two dice
        from all dice pools for physical actions until he's done
        with his next turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Fire: The target bursts into flames and, on his next
        action, must soak another 4L damage from fire. This
        damage is separate from the normal attack and without any
        extra successes added. The fire gutters out after one turn.&lt;br&gt;
        Water: The target is gripped in a drowning embrace.
        Next turn (or this turn, if he hasn't acted yet) subtract 3
        from his initiative total as struggles to clear water from his
        lungs and throat.&lt;br&gt;
        Wood: Thorns cover all the striking surfaces of the
        weapon, and it increases the damage of the attack by + 2L.

        Ghosts and dematerialized spirits cannot be hit by
        ordinary weapons. Though many powerful weapons can
        strike those immaterial beings, warriors caught without
        that kind of armament are in great danger when facing
        spirit foes. This Charm allows a Dragon-Blooded warrior
        to call upon the Dragon of Fire to enchant his weapon,
        allowing it to strike immaterial creatures normally. The
        character must spend the Essence and activate the Charm
        before making her attack, and her player must still roll to
        hit the creature as if it were material. This Charm provides
        no additional bonus beyond allowing the character to hit
        dematerialized spirits.

        With a few seconds' concentration, the Exalted can
        conjure up a weapon created entirely from his favored
        element. This weapon has the same qualities as an ordinary
        weapon of its type; it also has the qualities of a weapon
        enchanted by the Dragon-Graced Weapon Charm (see
        above). As the weapon is created out of raw elemental
        matter and Essence, it does not last for long, but a combat-
        ant can be sure that it will remain intact until the end of
        his current battle. When the scene ends, the elemental
        weapon dissipates, evaporating into a sparkle of light and
        a whiff of the character's aspected element. The conjured
        weapon can be any sort of melee weapon.

        Melee after an opponent's hand-to-hand attack. If even one
        success is achieve, regardless of how many successes the
        Dragon-Blood's opponent achieved, the attack is blocked
        completely. The Charm may be invoked after the opponent's

        &lt;br&gt;
        There is a practical limit, imposed by geometry and space,
        on the number of people that can attack a single target at once.
        Although it is unlikely that a Dragon-Blood has ever participated
        in grain threshing, this technique was so named due to its
        similarity to that activity. Only five foes can possibly effectively
        attack a single target simultaneously, and that number is greatly
        reduced should a target find himself in a defensible position -
        his back against a wall, for instance, or standing between two
        trees. With Threshing Floor Technique, the only limit to the
        number of attackers that can assault a single foe in one turn is
        the amount of Essence the Dragon-Blooded spends. The Exalt
        designates a target and spends 2 motes of Essence to activate the
        Charn and l mote of Essence per attacker. Then, so long as an
        attacker is within her ordinary movement distance from the
        target (that is, [Dexterity + 12] &amp;divide; 2 yards), she may make a melee
        attack at the designated target on her normal action; she dashes
        in, makes an attack normally and then pulls back to her
        previous position. Characters so empowered are not required to
        attack the target on their action, though, if they do not, the
        Essence spent to enable them to do so is still lost. Likewise, if the
        target is slain, Essence spent to empower characters who never
        got their shot is also still lost.

        to the task. The Exalt using Ringing Anvil Onslaught designates
        a single target, and his player rolls the character's Melee
        Ability (no Attribute is added) For each success, the Exalted
        gains an extra attack against the target this turn. The Dynast
        cannot gain more extra attacks than his Melee.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Seen by some as a refinement of Dragon-Graced
        Weapon, Fire Incites Water to a Riot of Clouds allows the
        Dragon-Blood to channel her connection with the element
        of fire through a metal weapon and into a body of water to
        generate a large volume of steam. The moment the Exalt
        activates this Charm and plunges her weapon into a body of
        water at least two feet deep, huge roiling clouds of white
        steam surge from the water around the Dragon-Blood's
        weapon. This steam isn't particularly hot and cannot be
        used to scald others, but it is highly effective at dampening
        opponents and creating a dense, billowing curtain of fog
        through which enemies cannot see. Due to its thickness, this
        fog is equal to fog at night on the visibility table (see Exalted,
        p. 237), limiting those caught in it to a maximum of three
        yards of murky visibility. The Exalt's weapon generates
        another 10 yards of steam each turn it remains in the water.
        The steam will tend to roll away from the Dragon-Blood,
        and in the absence of any prevailing wind, the character can
        make a Willpower roll (difficulty 3) to control which
        direction the cloud of steam billows.&lt;br&gt;
        Using this Charm to supplement an attack on a water
        elemental inflicts aggravated damage.

      &lt;br&gt;
      It is common in the course of combat for clashing
      weapons to give off sparks. This Charm gives the Exalt the
      ability to direct a spray of sparks into a foe's opponent's
      face any time their weapons clash.
      The Dragon-Blood can use this Charm any time she
      parries or blocks an opponent's metal weapon with her own or
      whenever her weapon hits anything metal or stone in the
      course of combat. Essence multiplies what would normally
      be a few (low Dexterity characters) or attacking (high Dex-
      terity characters) sparks aimed right into her opponent's
      eyes. The opponent will be blinded the following turn (as
      per the poor visibility rules on p. 232 of Exalted).
      Subtracting two successes from all attack rolls made for
      him. The player of the target of the spray of sparks must
      also make a reflexive Wits + Dodge roll to have his
      character turn away from the spray of sparks. If the roll
      succeeds, the Exalt is down only two dice on his next turn's
      attack roll instead of two successes.

        Prerequisite Charms: Ghost-Fire Blade&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Dragon-Blood channels Essence to her weapon
        on an attack, and if that attack succeeds, not only does the
        Exalt cause lethal damage with the blow, she also marks
        the target with a smoking brand that can lead the Exalt to
        her target should the target escape. The brand is difficult
        to hide and smolders through any clothing or for that hides
        it. While the brand cannot burn through metal armor, it
        can make the armor tremendously hot — so much so that
        it's intensely uncomfortable to wear next to the skin. Every
        three turns the target keeps the mark covered with armor,
        he suffers one level of bashing damage (which may be
        soaked as normal). This mark is plainly visible to all who
        see it, including mortals (who see it as a red and inflamed
        tattoo), but the brand also remains visible if the target
        becomes invisible or takes on a new form (making it very
        helpful when dealing with Fair Folk and Lunar Exalts).
        While marked by the spirit brand, the target cannot lose
        his pursuer by non-supernatural evasion techniques,
        and his player suffers a three-die penalty to all Stealth and
        Survival rolls.&lt;br&gt;
        A trail of black spirit smoke pours from the brand,
        which is visible to any who can perceive dematerialized
        spirits or Essence effects. This plume of smoke rolls in the
        direction of the brand's traveler. It cannot be touched or
        smelled, nor can it be dissipated by wind, by hands or
        bodies passing through it or by any natural means.&lt;br&gt;
        The burning mark is usually in the shape of the
        Dragon-Blood's weapon, although some advanced combatants
        have learned to deliver a more personalized
        brand (use the rules for stunting on page
        238, but the roll to mark is reflexive, and the attack does
        damage as normal).

        This Charm allows the Dragon-Blood to adapt perfectly to an opponent's combat style. By watching and
        analyzing an opponent in combat for no fewer than five
        turns (during which she can do nothing else), the Exalt
        reads the subtle strengths and flaws in the target's fighting
        technique and adjusts her own combat style accordingly,
        exploiting the target's weaknesses and defending against
        particular strengths. Roll Intelligence + Melee (or the
        appropriate Ability). This Charm lasts three turns plus two
        turns per success, during which the Dragon-Blood gains a
        bonus of one die per point of permanent Essence on all
        Dodge and Melee rolls made by her character against that
        one stated target.&lt;br&gt;
        Versions of this Charm exist that use Brawl or
        Martial Arts in place of Melee, but the minimum requirement
        of 4 remains the same, and all versions require
        Dodge 4. The Melee, Brawl and Martial Arts versions of
        this Charm must be learned separately. These versions
        are still Melee Charms. They simply analyze an enemy's
        use of different combat Abilities.&lt;br&gt;
        Due to the complexities and mental demands involved
        in reading and analyzing a target so thoroughly, the
        character can only be prepared to fight one opponent who
        has points of Intelligence. This is a dice-adding Charm.

        Earth is the most static and quiescent of the elements.
        This Charm enables a Dragon-Blooded character to infuse
        some of that somnolent stasis into another person's mind,
        putting them to sleep. Some Dynasts work this Charm
        through speaking in a low, droning voice; others prefer to use
        a glittering gemstone, such as the jewel in a ring, to fix their
        victim's attention and convey the flow of Essence. One can
        only bury someone's mind if one can keep them sitting still
        for five minutes, so this Charm calls for a fair bit of guile.
        The player rolls Manipulation + Presence, with a
        difficulty equal to the target's Essence. A simple success
        causes the target to sleep for an hour, and each extra
        success adds one hour to the total. During that hour, noise,
        light and movement do not awaken the victim. You could
        send the entire Red-Piss Legion past with cymbals and he
        wouldn't wake up. At the end of this period, the victim
        passes to normal slumber.
        While in the grip of magic sleep, the victim dreams
        strange, still dreams of the caves beneath the earth and the
        mysteries within them. Once in a while, someone wakes up
        afterward knowing where to dig a well that never goes dry,
        or the location of an ore deposit.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • More powerful versions of this charm can put a victim
        to sleep for longer periods. Old tales tell of great lords of the
        Silver Age whose bound enemies still slumber in hidden
        locations, or maidens cursed to sleep for a hundred years.&lt;br&gt;
        • A still more powerful variation petrifies the victim's
        body as well as her mind. Only occult means can rouse such
        a stone sleeper.

        People often describe strong passions as flames, and
        the Aspects of Fire take this metaphor literally. Through
        this Charm, a Dynast can whip up the flames of courage
        and anger, making a person more brave and aggressive.
        The character must say something fierce and rousing to his
        troops, and his player makes a Charisma + Presence roll. If
        the Charm succeeds, each recipient gains one dot of both
        Valor and Willpower for the next five minutes, up to the
        maximum possible. Alas, the Charm does not work on the
        character himself— and if the Dragon-Blood cuts and runs
        or otherwise shows cowardice, the Charm's effects end at
        once. An individual cannot benefit from multiple simultaneous
        uses of this Charm, even if different
        Dragon-Blooded invoke it.&lt;br&gt;

        The Exalted calls up a fiery passion in soldiers under his
        command, and they charge to the offensive, heedless of
        personal danger. The Dragon-Blood spends one mote of
        Essence per warrior that he commands, to a maximum of
        twice his Essence, and each of those warriors receives a single
        temporary Bruised health level. This temporary level is the
        first one lost when damage is taken, and it cannot be healed
        back even if curative magic is somehow applied to the soldier
        during the same scene that the Charm is activated.&lt;br&gt;
        If the soldier is undamaged when the scene ends, the bonus
        health level fades; if he is damaged, the lost health level disappears
        with no further ill effect. This Charm can only be used on
        soldiers that the Exalted directly commands (typically those
        purchased with the Command Background): While it can be
        used on other players' characters, any subject of the Charm loses
        the bonus health level immediately if he does not act as part of
        a unit under the Exalted's command. A given individual can only
        benefit from one application of this Charm in a scene.

        gain a Storyteller character's loyalty. Roil Manipulation +
        Presence; the target of the Charm reflexively resists with his
        Willpower. For every net success the Dragon-Blood achieves,
        the target will serve him as a loyal servant for one week; at
        the Storyteller's discretion the Exalted can extend that
        period by asking only minor or trivial tasks of the target.&lt;br&gt;
        If the Exalt achieves five or more successes, the target
        will serve him for the long term; characters swayed to serve
        the Exalted for the long term essentially become Henchmen.
        However, they do need to be treated well, or they,

        The Dragon-Blood becomes adept at getting an-

        person look foolish. In combat, this Charm can get the
        attention of an enemy within 20 yards. The target loses
        two dice from his dodge and parry dice pools when
        fighting anyone other than the Exalt who targeted him
        with this Charm due to distraction.&lt;br&gt;
        Unbearable Taunt Technique can also be used outside

        Presence roll and a suitably cutting comment are all that
        is needed to make the target look foolish in front of an
        assembled crowd. Obviously, the social use of this Charm
        may prove dangerous; the wise Dragon-Blooded is advised
        to use it sparingly - and only in front of a friendly crowd.

        cross through hazards and place himself into great danger in
        order to get off a hand-to-hand combat attack against the Exalt
        who uses it. The Dragon-Blood must spend the required
        Essence to activate this Charm; her target, who must be within
        10 yards and have an Essence lower than the Exalts, must use
        his next action to approach the Exalted and attack her (if he
        can), regardless of the intervening hazard or the danger in doing
        so. Characters cannot be compelled to obvious suicide through
        the use of this Charm (they will not, for example, leap into a
        chasm), but they will attempt to cross damaging hazards such
        as fires and raging rivers to reach the Exalt.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This simple Charm can only be used the first time the
        Dragon-Blood meets another in a social context. It allows
        the Exalt to read the other perfectly, allowing him to adjust
        his own behavior in any way necessary to make a perfect
        first impression. The Charm gives its user some insight into
        what drives the other person (political power, love, resentment,
        etc.) and also leaves a lasting impression on the
        target. The other person is left feeling that the Exalt is an
        unusually worthy individual of good breeding, great virtue
        or the like. The difficulty of all Social rolls against this
        individual are at -2 for this initial meeting and -1 the next
        time the Exalt meets this person (for a total of this Exalt,
        difficulty can be lowered below a minimum of 1). Even if
        the target never sees the Exalt again, she will be inclined
        to speak well of him to others.&lt;br&gt;
        Note that this Charm works only in social circumstances
        where a pleasant first impression can realistically be
        expected. A Dragon-Blood trying to be charming in the
        field of battle is going to be sorely disappointed (although if
        he somehow manages to pull it off, the warrior is probably
        less likely to desecrate his corpse out of spite).

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The Presence-savvy Exalt knows that the three passions
        — lust, rage and terror — are all closely linked.
        Through the use of subtle words and inflection, the
        Dragon-Blood can transform a target's passions from one
        to another, thereby making an enraged target feel amorous,
        a terrified target feel enraged or the like. Roll the
        character's Manipulation + Presence. The difficulty is the
        target's Essence, minus one for every point the character
        has above the target's (minimum of 1). The effects of this
        Charm do not take effect immediately. The Exalt must
        spend a number of turns in conversation with the target
        equal to 10 - her Essence in order to nudge the subject's
        emotional state in the right direction.&lt;br&gt;
        Successful use of this Charm results in a two-die bonus
        on pertinent rolls (on seduction rolls if the Dragon-Blood
        changed rage into lust, for example). A target who has
        been manipulated into a rage by the Dragon-Blood acts as
        through he had a Temperance Virtue of 1 for the remainder
        of the scene.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Dragon-Blood using this Charm binds his powerful
        affinity with the Fire Dragon to his voice, resulting in
        a shout so powerful that it ignites flammable objects, even
        up to 40 yards away. This Charm cannot damage flesh
        directly, but it can ignite clothes, wooden wagons, thatched
        huts and the like from a distance. The size of the fire started
        by this technique is not large, only about the size of a man's
        open hand, but the initial blaze is fairly hot and will easily
        ignite nearby material in the absence of countervailing
        conditions (rain, extreme humidity), often resulting in a
        huge blaze. If the substance is wet, the fire flickers out after
        one turn per point of the Exalt's Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        The player of a target whose clothes have been ignited
        must succeed on a simple Stamina + Endurance roll, or her
        character takes a level of lethal damage each turn until the
        garment is removed or the fire is extinguished.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm has a range of (the Exalt's Essence x
        20) feet.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Fire destroys quickly; water erodes slowly, subtly, but
        no less completely. Those who study the metaphysical
        aspects of the elements declare Water the most sinister and
        deadly of the elements. Masters of the Essence of Water
        can stir currents of doubt in the minds of others, eroding
        trust in favor of treachery.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm requires nothing more than a few minutes
        in which to talk to a person. The Storyteller sets the
        difficulty, based on the target's degree of devotion and
        faith in another person, institution, belief or cause. The
        Dragon-Blooded's player rolls Manipulation + Socialize. If
        he rolls enough successes, the target person becomes
        suspicious, cynical and hostile enough to betray whoever
        or whatever the Dynast wanted. The treacherous dislike
        persists for at least an hour after the Charm's use; if the
        Dynast received more successes than the minimum necessary,
        the hatred can last for days.&lt;br&gt;
        A Dynast who uses the Loyalty-Eroding Method on
        several well-chosen targets can turn an entire town against
        a victim. Rousing suspicion and hatred on such a large
        scale often runs out of control, though. After the affected
        people banish or lynch the target of their ire, the Storyteller
        secretly rolls one die for every person in the community
        affected by the Loyalty-Eroding Method. For each success
        rolled, the community attacks one more scapegoat as old
        enmities flare — and the Dynast has no control over who
        the people choose.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A more subtle and advanced Charm instills a seed
        of betrayal that grows and blossoms later instead of right
        away. Such a delayed-effect Charm might have a time
        limit, or prime a person for treachery when a certain
        condition is met or signal given.

        The character's stories and idle chitchat become more
        entertaining to those around him. Her every turn of phrase
        becomes wittier, her every comment more topical. Mechanically,
        this Charm allows the character to add two dice to her
        Socialize Ability for the scene for every mote she spends; she
        can add no more dice than she has dots in Socialize.

        Nearly any gathering of Terrestrial Exalted involves
        the consumption of alcohol, often in great quantity. A
        Dragon-Blood can use the Sweeten-the-Tap Method while
        near a quantity of alcohol - he expends a minimum of
        Essence, and the drink noticeably improves in quality,
        strength and taste. This will usually improve the general
        mood of the room, reducing by 1 the difficulty of all
        Socialize rolls for anyone present and imbibing for the rest
        of the evening. However, should anyone botch a Socialize
        roll during the rest of the scene, an overreaction is more
        likely to take place — possibly tempers will fray, or characters
        may make ill-advised seduction attempts. This side
        effect has no particular game mechanic; the Storyteller's
        judgment should be the guide.

        roll. She must accept the second roll even if it is worse
        than the first, and she cannot spend additional Essence to
        make subsequent rerolls after the first, Additionally, if
        Seizing the Tongue Technique is part of any Combo,
        then Essence must be spent to reactivate all the other
        Charms in that Combo when the reroll takes place, if those
        Charms have separate dice rolls associated with them, they
        are not rerolled

        The personal connections between arrogant and aggressive
        beings such as the Dragon-Blooded are often
        tenuous; it barely takes a spark to destroy the connection
        between two such individuals for a short while.&lt;br&gt;
        To activate this Charm, both the target individual and the
        character she is to be set against must be present. The Exalt
        spends the necessary motes of Essence and makes a simple
        comment to one individual about the other - &amp;quot;I hear he's got
        plans that don't include you&amp;quot; or the like works well enough.
        That is sufficient to weaken the bonds of friendship or love
        between the two characters for the remainder of the scene. The
        characters' reaction to this conflict is up to the Storyteller, of
        course; it may be both parties stomping off to cool their heads
        or engaging in a vicious argument or even coming to blows.&lt;br&gt;
        Neither party immediately remembers the character who
        started the disagreement between them, though other parties
        present may notice the character's activity. When the scene is
        over, cooler heads prevail, and both characters remember the
        strength of their friendship. Unless something horrifically bad
        happened between the two (again, a matter for the Storyteller's
        discretion), they will return to their previous relationship.&lt;br&gt;
        When the Charm ends, the character who was the
        original target of the Charm may remember the Exalted's
        well-timed turn of phrase (requires a successful Intelligence
        + Socialize roll with a difficulty equal to the Manipulation
        of the Exalt who used this Charm). This Charm is well-
        known in the Realm, and those who use it in social situations
        can be brought up on charges or disgraced.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not work if either target character has
        an Essence higher than that of the Exalt using the Charm.

        dice, solely for the purpose of seducing the Charm's target.

        The Dragon-Blooded with Friend-to-All-Nations
        Attitude finds herself to be equally at home on the Blessed
        Isle, in the Scavenger Lands or even in the barbaric
        reaches of the Wyld. While this Charm is active, the Exalt
        suffers no penalties to her Socialize Ability for being in a
        strange land, so long as she speaks the local tongue. If she
        does not, she may suffer a penalty at the Storyteller's
        discretion, but even so, that penalty will be relatively
        minor, as she instinctively knows all of the moves and basic
        manners of the culture into which she immerses herself.
        Strangely, this Charm is somewhat less effective in
        melting-pot cultures such as Nexus, as the character picks
        up on cultural standards from several groups simultaneously.
        Thankfully, people in such melting pots are, on
        average, more tolerant of cultural differences, so the net
        effect of the Charm is the same.

        This Charm enables the Dragon-Blood who uses it to
        cause a target's mind to temporarily skip over a past event
        involving the Exalted that would reflect poorly on the
        current discussion. That is to say, she makes the target
        forget about a single event in the past — an event that
        must have included the Exalt herself — just for the current
        scene. She can cause the target to forget about multiple
        events if she wishes, but that requires multiple uses of this
        Charm, just as with any other reflexive Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        When the scene is over, the target will be aware of what
        has happened to her, and she is likely to be quite unhappy
        about any bargains reached while she was not quite herself.
        That means that future uses of this Charm on the same:
        individual will require the Exalt to first use the Charm to
        smooth over the target's memories of having been previously
        fooled through the use of Smoothing Over-the-Past
        Technique. Covering up for careless use of this Charm can
        quickly become impossibly expensive in Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm does not work on characters whose
        Essence Traits are higher than that of the character
        using the Charm.

        Jade Defense is used to protect the Exalt from con
        games, seduction and intimidation attempts and similar
        forms of social or emotional manipulation. Years of
        interminable intriguing attune the Dragon-Blooded to
        a wide variety of political and social engineering techniques.
        Wise social operators quickly learn that any
        manipulation technique they can use on others can just
        as easily be used on them. Any Exalt feeling that he
        might be the subject of such techniques can spend
        Essence to amplify his own sense of ennui and sheer
        jadedness and, thereby, render himself resistant to any
        and all social control or manipulation techniques being
        used on him. Activating this Charm increases the difficulty
        of all Charisma, Manipulation and Socialize rolls
        used against the Exalt by half his Socialize (round up),
        rendering him utterly bored with nearly everything,
        including those using Socialize Charms on him. For the
        duration of this Charm, the character's Essence is considered
        one higher than it really is when he's targeted by
        mind-affecting or social Charms that do not work on
        individuals of high Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Clever courtiers learn early on to watch and analyze
        every gesture made by others in a social setting to see how
        — and in which direction — the wheels of loyalty and
        obligation turn. Knowing whom to trust with dirt on
        another — and whom not to — can be critical to a Dragon-
        Blood wanting to go far in Dynastic society.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm heightens the Dragon-Blood's sensitivity
        to the minute details of social interaction: whose eyebrow
        goes up at what comment, who's especially ingratiating to
        whom, who laughs just a bit too loudly at another's tired
        witticisms, etc. This Charm can let the Dragon-Blood
        know (among other things): if a particular individual is
        loyal to her, whom in the room an individual is loyal to and
        who is feigning loyalty to whom. This Charm does not
        explain these loyalties in any way. It simply reveals them.

        The victims of this Charm drown on dry land, locked
        into a fierce clinch with the Exalt. Survivors of the
        assault actually cough up water from their lungs. This
        Charm must be used in conjunction with a clinch attack
        against the target. The Dragon-Blooded's clinch does
        lethal rather than bashing damage. For each successive
        turn the clinch is maintained and this Charm is invoked,
        the clinch does an additional + 1L damage. Stopping the
        use of this Charm for even a turn will reset the damage of
        the clinch to normal.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A brawler using this Charm is capable of wrestling up
        to four opponents at once — theoretically, one for each
        limb, though combatants of particularly large girth may
        simply immobilize opponents with their bulk.
        The Exalt's player makes Dexterity + Brawl rolls to
        initiate the attacks, which must be clinches or holds. Each
        attack costs a single mote, each must be made against a
        different target, and the Exalt may not make more than four
        such attacks. The targets may dodge or parry as normal,
        meaning that some may escape while others may not.
        In subsequent turns, the Dragon-Blood may, after
        initiative is rolled but before anyone acts, spend Essence to
        keep this Charm active. Again, the cost is 1 mote per
        already-restrained victim per turn. If the character has less
        than four victims and others are still within reach, then on
        his action, he may pay more motes and attempt to put them
        in clinches or holds.
        If the Exalt does not pay the motes of Essence each
        turn to maintain the assault, then he must let some of the
        grappled opponents free. The Dragon-Blood may not
        move while using this Charm after the initial assault — his
        Victims must come to him.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Not even the Blessed Isle is immune to the inexorable
        power of water, as it is slowly shaped over the eons
        by the pounding of the waves. A Dragon-Blood emulates
        the repeated crashing of the surf with this style, wearing
        down the protection of his foe's armor with a flurry of
        blows. The Exalt makes a Brawl attack. Damage for the
        first such attack that lands ignores one point of the
        target's soak. If the character uses this Charm and strikes
        the target again later in the scene, each successive such
        blow ignores a an additional point of soak. Thus, on the
        second successful attack, the character would be at -2
        soak and on the third attack, -3. The target's armor is not
        physically damaged, just temporarily compromised to the
        benefit of the attacking Dragon-Blood— no other at
        -tackers gain this benefit, and the armor penalties do not
        last past the end of the scene.

        A Dragon-Blood using this Charm attacks her enemies to
        all sides with lightning-quick, accurate strikes. Each extra attack
        costs 2 motes. The Exalt must be facing multiple opponents, and
        she must attack each opponent at least once. She cannot launch
        more attacks in a turn than she has dots of Brawl.

        The average street brawler quickly falls back before any
        sharp pointy object waved at him. A true student of the art,
        however, can turn aside armed blows without dismay. Upon
        activating this Charm, the user may parry any incoming
        brawl, martial arts or melee attacks with his Brawl, including
        specialties, and with no penalty or harm for fighting unarmed.

        This Charm turns the Dragon-Blood's brawling strikes into
        deadly, crushing blows that are extremely difficult for an unarmed
        opponent to turn aside. A punch or kick delivered with
        this Charm does lethal damage rather than bashing and is treated
        as an attack with a weapon for the purpose of parrying. As usual,
        additional strikes made using this Charm during the same turn
        require that the Essence cost of the Charm be paid again.

        A master brawler unafraid to go toe to toe with a powerful
        enemy can use this Charm to aid her allies' attacks. While
        applying a hold to her foe, she exposes him to greater harm
        while keeping her own limbs more or less out of the way.
        After the Exalt makes a successful hold attack, she may
        use her extra successes on that roll to reduce her enemy's
        lethal and bashing soak totals by that amount until her next
        action or until the enemy breaks the hold. The result may be
        maintained through additional turns by paying two additional
        motes. Once each turn the hold is maintained, the
        Dragon-Blood's player may roll her character's Essence. Every
        success on this roll further reduces the target's soak by a point.
        The Exalt is not normally harmed by attacks aimed at the held
        foe, although a botched attack may still injure her.

        Using this Charm, a Dragon-Blood administrator can
        imbue his underlings with an echo of his own innate grasp of
        the workings of state. The bureaucrat may grant one trusted
        assistant a bonus of two dice per point of Essence spent. The
        assistant may not more than double her Bureaucracy, and the
        Exalt cannot donate more Ability than he has.&lt;br&gt;
        Alternately, for merely 1 mote of Essence, the Dynast may
        turn a group of dullards or even the soul-dead victims of the Fair
        Folk into passable temporary help by splitting his Bureaucracy
        Ability among them, giving a maximum of one point to each.
        This Charm requires some supervision — the assistants will
        have questions, and if they cannot find the Dragon- Blood to ask
        him their questions, the Charm fails. While supervising, the
        Dragon-Blooded technically has no Bureaucracy, and can do
        nothing but look after his charges. Temporary assistants must
        have originally possessed no dots in Bureaucracy.

        The Essence of bureaucracy is the same everywhere -
        the day-to-day affairs of a household or mercantile establishment
        tend to pool and eddy in predictable patterns no
        matter how grand or humble the scale. An Exalt may use this
        Charm to tap into the bureaucracy around her and under-
        stand its general nature and some specifics of its operation,
        such as where goods or documents are kept or who is
        responsible for what aspects of administration. This Charm
        does not grant unfettered access to guarded or locked areas,
        but it does allow the Dragon-Blood to use her Bureaucracy
        Ability in place of her Socialize Ability for purposes of
        dissembling about paperwork, permissions and passage.

        An administrator with this Charm can bend her entire
        bureaucratic apparatus to expedite a designated task: tax collec-
        tion, troop recruitment or selling merchandise, for example.
        Her followers perform their duties exceptionally well for the
        duration of the task, serving with the utmost dedication. At the
        completion of the task, the Dragon-Blood reaps additional
        benefits. Monetary profits increase by one percent per success
        on an Intelligence + Bureaucracy roll. If the end result is goods
        rather than coin, the amount is increased by two percent per
        success. Conscription and other recruitment are improved by
        two percent per success on a Charisma + Bureaucracy roll. The
        Storyteller is responsible for determining the base result of any
        such endeavor, before the improvements granted by this
        Charm. These improvements are strictly magical and do not
        actually improve the bureaucracy in the long term.

        This Charm is priceless to Dragon-Blooded who must
        travel but cannot bear to leave their affairs in the hands of
        others. Before leaving on a journey, a Dragon-Blood knowing
        this Charm may designate a proxy to make decisions on his
        behalf (most give a token of some kind, perhaps a seal, scroll
        or garment). The designee administers precisely as the Exalt
        would have were he present, making decisions and placing
        resources with her master's remarkable skill. Dusty legends
        popular only among scribes tell of assassinated Dynasts who
        reach out from beyond the grave to wreak havoc on the affairs
        of their murders by way of their faithful servants.&lt;br&gt;
        The Charm is effective for a number of weeks equal to
        the successes scored on a Perception + Bureaucracy roll, but
        the exact duration is not obvious to either the proxy or the
        Dragon-Blooded, who must simply trust in his abilities. The
        Dragon-Blood may end the Charm sooner if he wishes. If he
        does so, the committed Essence begins returning normally.

        There is an art to impeding the flow of a bureaucracy.
        The Thrashing Carp Serenade is only the beginning of that
        art. By means of this Charm, an Exalt may slow administrative
        tasks and productive deliberation in the area within the sound
        of his voice to a near standstill. In order to make any progress,
        the player of the opposing bureaucrat must best the wielder of
        this Charm's player in an opposed Stamina + Bureaucracy
        test. Any Water-aspected novice can hold a roomful of aged
        scribes at bay, but only the experienced or rash use this
        technique in an august body such as the Deliberative.

        Presenting an appropriate gift can take the edge off an
        uncomfortable social gathering or gain favors and access
        that would otherwise seem unattainable. Using this Charm,
        a Dragon-Blood intuits what would make the perfect gift, for
        public presentation, or the perfect bribe, for private dealings.
        Specifying gift or bribe, the Exalt's player rolls Perception
        + Bureaucracy. The Exalt must know the intended recipient;
        knowing him by reputation raises the difficulty of the
        roll by 2. This Charm does not provide the gift — or even
        easy access to it — it merely provides the information. The
        brutish administrators of the tributary lands may be fondest
        of gifts of wealth, but the nuanced tastes of the Dynasts may
        require that the would-be gift-giver acquire unusual items
        such as a lock of hair from a vain rival or a sapphire exactly
        the color of a favored mistress's eyes.

        The quickest path to disaster for a political gambit is to
        call a vote before knowing how the votes will fall. Armed
        with this Charm, a master bureaucrat can safely avoid that
        pitfall. With but a moment's consideration, the Exalt knows
        how many votes yea, nay or abstaining would result should
        the matter under discussion be called to a vote. It does not
        reveal by whom the votes would be cast. The Dragon-Blooded
        do not only use this Charm to pass their own
        agendas. They also hurry their rivals' plans to failure or
        simply judge where their vote will bring the highest price.
        Note that this Charm can only be used on groups of seven
        or more; it simply fails if used on a smaller group.

        Fire reveals what is hidden. Its light pushes aside the
        darkness; its heat reveals the metal within the ore. A
        Dynast can use Essence to make an ordinary flame blaze up
        with a glaring, pitiless light that reveals whatever another
        person tries to conceal. Secret cupboards, chambers and
        passages are easily located as the hair-fine crack of their
        hidden doors suddenly stand out like gaping black chasms.
        A person's disguise looks laughably false.&lt;br&gt;
        The player rolls Perception + Investigation. A simple
        success rolled for this Charm negates any physical attempt
        to make one object or person look like another. In cases
        where something is hidden by misdirection or being placed
        in or behind other objects (such as a letter hidden in a stack
        of other missives, or within a long-necked vase) the
        Storyteller must set a difficulty rating based on how clev-
        erly or thoroughly the object is concealed, and the player
        must meet that difficulty when rolling for the Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • The Revealing Light Method does not penetrate
        magical forms of concealment and disguise. An improved
        Charm can — or at least, each success rolled cancels one
        success from any Charm of concealment.&lt;br&gt;
        • A more powerful or skilled Dynast could develop a
        Charm that would reveal any attempt to tell a deliberate
        lie. The Dragon-Blooded &amp;quot;sees it in his eyes&amp;quot; that the target
        was fibbing.

        The magistrate or investigator with this Charm learns
        the myriad ways of the criminal; his eye is better able to
        connect seemingly disparate clues, and his intuition greatly
        improves. The character can improve his Investigation
        dice pool by two dice for every mote of Essence spent. The
        character cannot do more than double his Investigation
        Trait with this Charm, and he must pay the full motes of
        Essence even if he needs to raise a Trait by only one die.

        A good investigator quickly learns to discern the nervous
        habits, tics and mannerisms of people suffering under
        a load of guilt. Since most guilt is associated with a crime, the
        character becomes better able to discover a criminal among
        a group of people. After spending Essence, the character's
        player should make a Manipulation + Investigation roll. A
        success here will point the investigator to the character
        within eyesight currently suffering from the greatest load of
        guilt. This is purely subjective, of course, and mostly left in
        the hands of the Storyteller. Additionally, characters who
        commit heinous crimes without a shred of conscience might
        feel no guilt whatsoever from the acts they perform, making
        this Charm useless in finding them.

        supernatural levels when he learns this Charm. With it, he
        can ferret out false statements in conversation, helping
        him find the truth of a situation. This Charm does not
        detect evasions or half-truths; it only points out statements
        that the speaker knows to be false. The Exalted must pick
        a target and spend the Essence and Willpower necessary to
        activate this Charm; for the rest of the scene, falsehoods
        spoken by that target will trigger a tingling sensation on
        the back of the character's neck. If the target is aware of the
        scrutiny he is under, he may conceal lies by spending 1
        point of Willpower per statement. This Charm has no
        effect if the target's permanent Essence is equal to or higher
        than the Essence of the Exalt using this Charm.

        The Exalted spends around 10 minutes walking around
        the scene of a crime (or any event he wishes to investigate);
        his player must then make an ordinary Investigation roll for
        the Dynast to find ordinary pieces of evidence (footprints,
        stray hairs, blood, etc.). This Charm uses a touch of sympathetic
        magic to trace that evidence back to its creator. Roll
        Intelligence + Investigation after spending the necessary
        Essence to activate the Charm. With one success, the character
        receives an impulse — a mild tugging — that pulls him
        in the direction of the culprit. With three or more successes,
        the character receives that impulse along with a fleeting
        glimpse of the culprit as he appeared at the time of the crime.

        By simply meeting a person and coming within a few
        yards of him, the Exalted can sense the identities of his
        closest associates. Typically, these will be the character's
        family members, business associates and members of any
        sworn brotherhoods the Exalt belongs to, but they can also
        be characters delineated by certain Backgrounds. Roll
        Perception + Investigation; every success gives the name
        and one-sentence description of two of the target's compatriots
        or servants. Even if the roll fails, the Dragon-Blood
        will still learn information about one of the target's associates.
        Associates are revealed in roughly the following
        order: family members, members of sworn brotherhoods,
        allies, mentors, connections, henchmen; the Storyteller
        can change that order as he sees fit.

        By simply meeting a person and coming within a few
        yards of him, the Exalted can determine the place that the
        person calls home. Usually, this is the character's primary
        residence, but in the case of the Dragon-Blooded, who
        might have several residences, it is the place that the
        subject truly considers to be his home. If the subject has
        any dots in the Manse Background, the Charm is almost
        certain to point directly at his Manse of primary residence.
        If the subject or one of his allies is a sorcerer, his home may
        be warded against such divinations. In that case, this
        Charm will point to another of the character's residences.
        The Charm will only identify a building, not a particular
        apartment or room within that building — and in the case
        of longtime travelers or the impoverished, the Charm will
        simply indicate that the subject has no true home.

            Those who live in Atsiluth Eternal dwell in luxury such
            as even the Forest Witches cannot imagine. With a moment's
            study of the Essence flows around her, a character can bring
            forth unbounded wealth. Invoking this Charm within Atsiluth
            Eternal, a character can conjure any mundane object or
            structure, as well as any artifact or Manse up to level 5.
            However, the artifacts and Hearthstones this Charm creates
            only affect the &amp;quot;material&amp;quot; reality of Atsiluth Eternal. They can
            improve the user's perceptions but cannot otherwise divine
            information or directly affect the minds of others. They
            cannot act at range without some physical effect that conveys
            their power to the target. Outside of Atsiluth Eternal, they do
            not function at all. The Sea of Mind chooses where the
            summoned thing appears — the character cannot summon a
            Manse into the air above an enemy, although she can expect
            a summoned weapon to appear in her hand.

            Atsiluth Eternal and calls forth her vision soul: an image of
            herself drawn from a dream of future days. Such images are
            vicious, twisted and perverted liars, desiring primarily to
            torment those who call them forth with false hopes and false
            despairs. A wise Witch can, nevertheless, finagle hints from
            them about the future, the present and the past. The player
            makes a Manipulation + Investigation roll. If the Storyteller
            wishes to play out the conversation, then each success represents
            an opportunity to force out such a truth. The Exalt can
            spend one of these successes at any time to determine the
            vision soul's motivation behind a given statement — for
            example, to tease the Exalt with obfuscation, to encourage
            unwarranted despair or to save face after being tricked into
            making some admission. Otherwise, the difficulty of the roll
            is 3, and success tells the character one thing she should watch
            for, one thing she should fear and one thing she should desire.

        This simple Charm allows a Dragon-Blood to know
        if he is being observed. It was developed in the days before
        the Realm proper, when it was conceivable that one of
        the noble Terrestrial Exalted could act in a criminal
        capacity. In these dangerous days, the Charm sees use
        among those Exalted who might act as spies or who wish
        to speak to a confidante unobserved. Simply spend the
        necessary Essence and roll Perception + Larceny; a single
        success tells the Exalted whether he is being observed.
        Each additional success points out the location of an
        observer, starting with the closest.

        The greatest spies and thieves of the Realm know that
        the best way to avoid detection in their efforts is to leave as
        little evidence as possible of their passing. However, those
        spies and thieves know full well that the most talented
        magistrates and house investigators can learn a great deal
        from a trace as innocuous as a single hair. By activating this
        Charm as he enters a location, a Dragon-Blood prevents
        himself from leaving inadvertent evidence. This Charm
        does not prevent the character from being observed; it
        merely prevents him from leaving behind clues to his
        identity, such as footprints. Also, this Charm does not
        prevent the character from deliberately leaving behind
        evidence of his presence (if, for instance, he is a romantic
        master thief and always leaves a rose at the scene of a crime,
        this Charm does not prevent him from doing so). Characters
        using this Charm cannot be tracked except by supernatural
        means, but the Charm's short duration means that it is an
        expensive way to conceal ones passage for a long while.

        Many a time has come when a mortal thief or spy has
        wished for the ability to see what lies beyond a doorway or
        inside a chest without risking the opening of a latch or lock.
        Spies among the Terrestrial Exalted do not merely wish for
        this ability; this Charm allows them to do precisely that. The
        character simply spends the necessary Essence, and an area
        roughly two feet square before his eyes becomes transparent.
        That area doesn't move — once the character has used this
        Charm, the area that was in front of him when he spent the
        Essence remains transparent to him for a full turn. The
        Dragon-Blood can only see through about a three-inch
        thickness of stone — perhaps twice that of wood and half
        that much iron or jade. The material is only transparent to
        the Exalted using this Charm; others cannot see through it.
        Walls, doors and containers can be enchanted to prevent
        this kind of voyeurism.

        required Essence and then immediately reroll the dice pool
        for the most recent Larceny action his character performed;
        this must take place right after the roll is made and before the
        Storyteller describes its success or failure. The Exalted must
        accept the result of the second dice roll, even if it is worse
        than the first one. Additionally, if the Larceny action and
        this Charm are part of a Combo, then using the Charm
        forces the Exalted to re-spend all of the necessary Essence to
        activate the other Charms in the Combo, even if he does not
        need to reroll or reactivate them.

        The occasional orphaned Dragon-Blood on the
        streets of hinterland cities such as Nexus might grow up
        to learn this Charm; ordinarily, noble Terrestrials of the
        Realm will have nothing to do with it, save possibly for
        its application to later Charms. Ordinarily, even the
        simplest Larceny actions - pocket-picking and bag-snatching
         — require the character to slow down slightly,
        using only half of his maximum movement (which
        would be his Dexterity + 12 yards) on the turn he uses
        Larceny. With this Charm, the character may use his
        full dice pool on a simple Larceny action (one that
        would ordinarily take just one turn) while running flat-
        out. The action can take place at the beginning, middle
        or end of this movement.

        With this Charm, the Exalted can cause an object
        to disappear from its current location and reappear in
        his hands without crossing the intervening space. The
        character must be able to see the object clearly — if it
        is within a locked chest, he must use Window-In-The-Door
        Technique (see above) to see it before he can use
        Space-Crossing Theft Technique to grab it. However, if
        he can see it, he only needs to expend the Essence and
        off it goes, as long as it weighs less than about 15 pounds
        (the Storyteller's judgment is final as to what can be
        taken and what can't). This Charm does not work on
        items held by a sentient being (a mortal, Exalted or
        spirit), but it will work on items they are merely wearing:
        the Exalted could snatch a sheathed sword but not
        a sword in a foe's hand.

        Bounding Main Technique&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: 1 hour&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Supplemental&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Sail: 2&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Dynasts attuned to Water can become some of the
        world's greatest sailors. The Charm makes every sailing
        task just a little bit easier: The wind doesn't die or shift at
        awkward moments, there always seems to be a current in
        the desirable direction, and crewmembers do their jobs
        with skill and efficiency.&lt;br&gt;
        In game terms, every two successes rolled with this
        Charm (rounded up) cancel out one difficulty penalty
        from a Sail-based feat. Thus, if the Storyteller rules that
        threading the narrow, stormy Straits of Hell normally
        would be difficulty 3, one or two successes with this Charm
        would reduce the difficulty to 2, and three or four successes
        would reduce the task to normal difficulty. The player
        must still make Ability rolls and gain at least a simple
        success for tasks, but does not suffer penalties for adverse
        conditions.&lt;br&gt;
        Multiple characters cannot add together successes
        rolled for this Charm. Only the roll with the greatest
        number of successes counts. For instance, if two characters
        both use Bounding Main Technique and one rolls two
        successes while the other rolls three, only the second
        character's Charm has any effect.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A more powerful version of this Charm extends
        over multiple ships, at least if they stay fairly close together.&lt;br&gt;
        • A more skilled and powerful sailor could reverse this
        Charm and use it against an enemy, adding difficulty
        penalties for any sailing task. On the high sea, this merely
        hinders a ship— it doesn't move as quickly, the crew seems
        clumsy and stupid, and so on. Moderately risky tasks (such
        as sailing a narrow passage between rocky shoals) can
        become incredibly dangerous.

        With a look at the sky, the Exalted can predict the
        weather for the next day or so; his empathy with the
        currents of the ocean and air give him real prescience
        regarding the weather. The Charm will fail if the local
        weather is changing in response to a magical event or
        sorcery; this Charm only describes to the character
        what the natural weather will be if nothing unusual
        takes place. Perceptive Dragon-Blooded can sometimes
        use this Charm to predict events other than the
        weather: If, for instance, Admiral Potan's fleet is pre-
        paring to sail on a rebellious prefecture as soon as a
        storm breaks, the user of this Charm can predict
        exactly when they will set sail. And impossibly heavy
        clouds appearing out of clear blue skies might be a
        harbinger of an impending volcanic eruption. This
        Charm only works when the character is on the water;
        it fails when the Exalted's feet are on land.

        When time is of the essence and getting a ship into
        safe harbor is more important than the crew's rest and
        safety, a captain or pilot with Storm-Outrunning Technique
        is essential to survival and success. This Charm
        allows a ship's officer to double that ship's rate of
        movement for the current scene. This may enable a
        small ship to beat an enemy fleet to a friendly port,
        giving the city some warning; it may let a ship beat a
        storm to safety; or it may let a crew of merchants beat
        a rival to a choice port. To activate the Charm, the
        Exalt need only spend the necessary Essence. The
        greatly increased speed may require one or more Sail
        rolls, especially if the ship cruises through hazardous
        waters at double normal velocity. Also, note that if
        this Charm is used from the deck of a becalmed sailing
        ship it will have no effect, as a speed of zero, when
        doubled, remains zero.

        The finest captains and pilots can thread their ships
        through the most dangerous patches of sea, avoiding
        submerged hazards with flair and panache. This Charm is
        the source of more than one pilot's reputation. With it, an
        Exalt gains an instinctive knowledge of any submerged
        hazards within five miles of the ship's current location, as
        well as the prevailing current, danger spots and safe channels
        in the same radius. The net effect of this knowledge is
        that the pilot's Sail dice pool improves by three dice for the
        remainder of the scene for the purpose of avoiding hazards.
        This Charm does not directly protect the ship from such
        hazards: If the pilot makes a bad mistake, the hull might
        still be rent asunder. It also does not give its user any special
        awareness of the activities of other characters: It cannot
        point out an ambush in a narrow passage or the impending
        arrival of an enemy vessel.

        A Charm favored by Wood-aspected sailors, Sturdy
        Bulkhead Concentration enhances the strength of a ship's
        hull without making it heavier. When this Charm is
        active, the hull gains three additional health levels and 2
        additional soak. The benefit only remains as long as the
        Exalted who activated the Charm remains aboard the
        vessel. To activate the Charm, the character needs only to
        spend the necessary Essence while aboard the ship.

        Whenever a ship under the command of a Dragon-Blooded
        with this Charm comes into contact with hostile ships
        of any stripe, it is temporarily camouflaged as a ship of that
        allegiance: The ship appears to be a merchantman to those
        aboard merchantmen; it looks as a pirate ship does to pirates;
        and so on. The Charm is largely a visual illusion — the vessel's
        flag changes its appearance, and the crew appears, from a
        distance, to be the appropriate sort of crew for a ship of its type.
        The Charm does not change the line of the ship itself, so one
        cannot, for instance, hide an imperial dreadnought among
        fishing smacks and expect to go unnoticed. The Charm also
        fails should any viewer set foot upon the ship; visitors and
        raiders see the ship as it really is, once they are aboard it.

            By pursing her lips and whistling as she invokes this
            Charm, an Exalt can call the winds into the sails of her ship
            and escape from a dangerous situation — or hurl herself into
            battle. The wider the sails and the mightier the ship, the
            more winds are called, as the spirits of the air hasten to obey
            the Exalt, until the ship is moving at full speed in the desired
            direction. The winds are intensely localized and will affect
            other ships within a couple hundred meters of the Exalt's
            ship. However, they cannot be commanded to alter their
            direction once summoned. The ship may run before the
            wind or tack into it, but it cannot turn back on itself. The
            winds will cause the ship to move at its full rate of speed,
            depending on the type of ship, and will last for up to a scene.

            When this Charm is activated, all those who see the
            ship on which the Exalt stands perceive it as an awesome
            naval battleship, haloed with strange lights and manned by
            deadly warriors —even if it's a rickety old piece of wood held
            together by worn-out nails and crewed by the sweepings of
            the local port. While common sense cuts in a moment later
            and the ship is clearly visible as what it actually is, the players
            of all those who were looking at the ship when the Charm
            took effect must succeed in a reflexive Willpower roll for the
            characters to attack it. This Charm is normally used in order
            to gain the advantage of surprise. A wise captain can have
            half the enemy crew slaughtered before it manages to pull
            itself together and fight back.

            By spending 5 motes of Essence and invoking this
            Charm, an Exalt can whisper his name into the waves
            around his vessel, and it will be carried to all sea spirits,
            pelagials or other sentient inhabitants of the ocean within
            five miles of his ship. All those who have no particular and
            personal reason to hate that Exalt will be instinctively
            reminded of the power and authority of the Exalted and will
            travel to the vessel to pay their respects and to find out why
            the Exalt has declared his presence. Particularly powerful
            creatures or minor gods may send a representative rather
            than attend themselves. This Charm can be used while at
            port, but fewer creatures of the sea are likely to answer the
            summons. Any beings who will arrive do so within half an
            hour at the most. Their behavior and the length of time they
            remain depends upon the attitude or requests of the Exalt.

            &lt;br&gt;
            By invoking this Charm, the Exalt summons a great
            swarm of lampreys and similar clinging creatures, which
            adhere to the hull of the target ship, slowing it and possibly
            even causing it to founder if the weather conditions are
            exceptionally bad. The target ship, which must be within
            a mile of the Exalt, has its speed reduced by 10 percent for
            every mote of the Exalt's permanent Essence and will
            remain at this reduced speed until its hull is cleaned or for
            a week, whichever is sooner. This may require a formal dry-docking,
            if the crew has no facilities to do so at sea. This
            Charm fails to work on any ships whose hulls are crafted
            from the Five Magical Materials or other imperishable
            First Age materials, though the Essence is still lost, as such
            ships are of too noble a substance to be so fouled.

            This Charm invokes the powers of the Exalted to
            disguise the ship, clothing it in the appearance of an ally —
            or even an enemy. When a ship with this Exalt on board
            flies the colors of a particular person or group and comes
            into contact with other ships, the Exalt's ship temporarily
            appears to be the ship of the captain who flies those colors
            or a typical ship of that group. This is a visual illusion and
            even goes so far as to alter the perceived lines of the ship
            if necessary, so that a warship may appear to be a slaver's
            dhow or even a common fishing vessel. The Charm fails
            the moment that any outsider sets foot on the ship or if any
            damage (such as that of a flaming arrow or a barrel of pitch)
            is done to it. It has no mechanical effects in terms of sailing
            speed, defense or anything else.

        Wind makes archery less accurate because it blows
        arrows off course. The Aspects of Air, however, can
        persuade the winds to let the arrow fly unhindered. Each
        point of Essence the character has cancels one point of
        extra difficulty. Thus, a Dynast of Air with Essence 4 could
        practice target shooting in a hurricane! Each bowshot
        demands a separate use of this Charm.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A more experienced Aspect of Air might be able to
        negate wind penalties for a few minutes, during which she
        could fire as many arrows as she wanted.&lt;br&gt;
        • The character could extend the Archer's Favorable
        Wind to a small group of other characters.&lt;br&gt;
        • An Air-attuned archer might persuade the winds to
        blow against the arrows of his enemies, increasing their
        difficulty to hit.

        Through this basic Charm, a Dragon-Blooded archer
        persuades the winds to propel and guide his arrow. The
        range increment of the character's weapon in doubled for
        that attack.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A more experienced Dynast of Air could extend this
        Charm's effect to a small group of people.&lt;br&gt;
        • As with various Archery-based Charms used by
        Solars, a Dragon-Blooded archer might negate range pen-
        alties entirely.

        Just as green leaves will bloom after the harshest winter,
        so a Dragon-Blood with this Charm will always strike her
        target. After spending the 2 motes of Essence, the archer's
        player may reroll the character's Dexterity + Archery completely.
         She must accept the second result. If this Charm is
        included in a Combo, the Essence cost for all other incorporated
        Charms must be paid again as if for a second shot, but
        only one (hopefully accurate) arrow is actually fired.

        The physical limitations of wood and sinew are overcome
        by this Charm, allowing the Exalted archer to
        launch a flurry of arrows at his foe. Each arrow fired after
        the first costs 1 mote of Essence, but is fired using the
        archer's full dice pool. The Dragon-Blood is limited to
        firing his permanent Essence rating in arrows per turn, and
        he may not split his dice pool for extra actions.

        grows will yield up appropriate ammunition to the archer's
        gathering hands. The chosen plant — even something as
        odd as a desert cactus or a marsh reed — sprouts a number
        of arrows equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence in response
        to her desires. The archer may specify the type of
        arrow she desires, and the arrows may be shared with others
        — they are perfectly normal (if often somewhat odd-looking)
        arrows.

        In the hands of the Dragon-Blooded, an arrow is not
        merely a pointy stick — it is an extension of the living tree
        from which it came, and as such, it is inimical to the
        undead. As soon as it is fired from the bow, an arrow
        imbued with this Charm begins to bolt leaves (without
        interfering with the arrow's flight). Upon striking an
        undead creature, it erupts into full bloom, wrapping the
        foul creature in blossoms and leaves and causing aggravated,
        rather than lethal, damage. This Charm has no
        effect on living creatures. The Charm has no effect on the
        Abyssals and their Deathlord masters, but it is as effective
        on materialized ghosts and nemissaries as it is on hungry
        ghosts and the walking dead.

        Dragon-Blooded students of the bow have learned,
        through hard practice, to track the expected path of a
        projectile. Using this Charm, an Exalt at the sharp end of
        an arrow's flight may attempt to turn it aside before impact
        with a missile of his own. If the attempt's Dexterity +
        Archery total, including any penalties for multiple actions,
        equals or exceeds the attacker's successes, the
        incoming missile is deflected. A partial parry is not possible;
        this is an all or nothing attempt. Not just arrows, but
        any projectile may be turned aside, including knives, axes,
        chamber pots, shoes and other oddments.

        An Exalt with this Charm is now a master of the
        arrow's flight. By filling the sky above her allies with a
        barrage of arrows, the archer may defend her companions
        from ranged attacks. The archer must have and fire two
        arrows per protected ally, which can include himself. The
        character's player then makes a Dexterity + Archery roll.
        Until the character's next action, compare any ranged
        attack against a protected character to the result of this
        Dexterity + Archery roll. If the number of successes equals
        or exceeds those generated by the attacker, the attack is
        foiled. If it is less, the successes subtract from the attack as
        the missile is turned aside. The Exalted archer may not
        split her dice pool or take any other actions during the time
        she protects her allies, or the protection ends immediately.

        Using this Charm, a Dragon-Blooded archer may
        imbue an arrow fired from his bow with enough Essence
        and will that it will turn aside any assault within the range
        of his bow. The archer's player rolls Dexterity + Archery;
        successes on this roll subtract from the successes of the
        attack the archer is attempting to deflect. If the archer
        exceeds the attacker's successes, immediately apply the
        remaining successes as an archery attack against the character
        who launched the assault against which the Exalt is
        defending. The archer may not use any other Charms
        during the turn in which he executes Sparrow Dives at
        Hawk; although the action is complete in the blink of an
        eye, it requires intense spiritual concentration.

        Drowning-in-blood-strike&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 4 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;br&gt;
        The body, as anyone can see, contains a lot of water
        - blood. Dragon-Blooded warriors who learn the hidden
        tides and currents of blood can strike in such a way as to
        cause internal bleeding into an enemy's lungs. The victim
        can literally drown in his own blood.&lt;br&gt;
        To use this Charm, the attacker must successfully
        strike her opponent in some way. If the Drowning-in-Blood
        Strike roll succeeds, the target loses one point of
        Stamina on each subsequent turn, for as many turns as the
        player rolled successes on the Essence + Medicine roll.
        The Drowning-in-Blood Strike does not itself inflict health
        levels of damage, though it may look like a series of rapid
        punches or some other attack.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A more skilled or powerful Dynast no longer needs
        to punch his opponent to inflict the Drowning-in-Blood
        Strike; a light slap, or even a mere brush with a finger, will
        suffice to disrupt the flow of blood.&lt;br&gt;
        • An even more advanced version of the Drowning-
        in-Blood Strike adds a time delay: The attacker can prime
        the victim to drown in his own blood minutes or hours
        later.&lt;br&gt;
        • Techniques resembling the Drowning-in-Blood
        Strike can be used to stanch internal or external bleeding.

        Herbal Medicine Techniques&lt;br&gt;

        Duration: Until consumed&lt;br&gt;

        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        In the Age of the Exalted, most drugs and medicines
        come from plants. A physician or druggist who under-
        stands the Essence within plants can prepare drugs and
        medicines with uncannily precise effects. Each effect is
        actually a separate Charm, but a character who learns one
        Herbal Medicine Technique probably knows a few more as
        well. Some common tricks include:&lt;br&gt;
        • Time Delay: A drug or medicine takes effect at a
        time set by the Dragon-Blooded character, perhaps days
        after the Dynast administered the draught.&lt;br&gt;
        • Trigger: A drug or medicine takes effect when a
        certain external condition is met.&lt;br&gt;
        • Tuning: The druggist can control the content of
        hallucinations caused by a drug.&lt;br&gt;
        Most uses of an Herbal Medicine Technique require
        only a simple success. Some applications - for instance,
        very precise hallucinations or a time delay longer than a
        few hours — might impose difficulty penalties.
        The Dynast who would use an Herbal Medicine
        Technique must compound the drug or medicine herself
        and infuse it with Essence at that time. The effect of the
        Essence-charged drug lasts its regular duration. Only after
        the magic medicine runs its course can the character who
        created it recover the motes of Essence used in its creation.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • With experience, a Dragon-Blooded pharmacist
        might Combo different Herbal Medicine Techniques.&lt;br&gt;
        • More skilled and powerful druggists might produce
        medicines with actual magical effects on their users. Storytellers
        may want to restrict how &amp;quot;magical&amp;quot; an effect
        characters can achieve through Medicine-based Charms.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Nearly any Exalted with the Medicine Ability can tell
        at a glance whether a wound has been infected. Infections
        rarely strike the Exalted themselves, but their servants,
        henchmen and bodyguards often suffer from such maladies
        in the hours and days following battle. Regardless of the
        nature of the character suffering from infection, Dragon-Blooded
        with this Charm can remove the infection with
        just a touch and the expenditure of a mote of Essence.
        Removing the infection does not eliminate damage already
        done, but it removes the source of infection and
        prevents it from recurring to this injury - even if the
        Charm's subject does something foolish, like enter the
        sewers of Nexus with an open wound. So long as the wound
        has been treated with Infection Banishing Prana, it will
        not become infected. Note that Infection Banishing Prana
        only works on infections caused by physical injury; ordinary
        and magical plagues are unaffected by it.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character's knowledge of the medicinal arts
        and the sources of infection has grown to such levels
        that he can magically infect his own weapon as he
        strikes; if he does at least one lethal wound to the target,
        the wound is much more likely to become infected. The
        difficulty of the Stamina + Resistance roll to avoid
        infection from the attack goes up by +2, even for
        Exalted. Frequent use of this Charm is sure to win the
        character enemies, as there is no more hated weapon
        than disease. The Essence must be spent to activate this
        Charm before the character makes his attack roll, and if
        the attack does not do at least one lethal wound, the
        Essence is wasted. This Charm can explicitly be used in
        a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this technique, the Dragon-Blood becomes
        like a healer out of legend. He can remove all but the
        most powerful magical plagues from his allies with a
        touch of his hand. The Exalt must make an ordinary
        diagnosis with his Medicine Ability at some time before
        using Disease-Banishing Technique, as it is necessary to
        know what plague it is the character intends to eliminate.
        If the diagnosis roll is successful, however, then the
        simple expenditure of a few seconds' time, the touch of
        the Exalted's hand and the expenditure of the necessary
        Essence combine to violently purge the disease from the
        subject's body. The subject is likely to convulse and expel
        some foul substance from her mouth and nose as this
        Charm takes effect, costing her his next turn if one had
        been available. Should the subject suffer from multiple
        plagues — a terrible fate indeed! - then this Charm
        must be used multiple times. Disease-Banishing Technique
        does work on battlefield infection - however,
        Infection-Banishing Prana is a far more effective tool for
        such things. This Charm, like so much other magic, is
        powerless against the Great Contagion.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this simple Charm, the Exalted can rapidly close
        open and bleeding wounds on his body, allowing himself to
        heal those wounds far more quickly than a mortal could.
        The Charm leaves only bruises and sprains behind, rather
        than life-threatening injury. So long as at least 1 mote of
        Essence is spent, any bleeding wounds automatically close.
        In addition, every 2 motes of Essence spent turns one lethal
        wound level into a bashing wound level instead. The
        character does not have to convert all of his lethal wounds
        into bashing wounds if he does not wish to do so. This
        Charm can also be used on other characters.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This complex Charm allows the Exalted to turn
        truly horrific injuries, such as those inflicted by supernatural
        sources, into mere lacerations and broken bones.
        By spending 3 motes of Essence, he can convert an
        aggravated wound level into a lethal wound level. The
        Dragon-Blooded does not have to convert all of his
        aggravated wounds to lethal wounds if he does not wish
        to do so or cannot afford the Essence. This Charm also
        automatically closes any bleeding wounds from which
        the character suffers. Aggravated wounds converted to
        lethal wounds with this Charm can later be converted
        to bashing wounds with Wound-Closing Touch, above.
        This Charm can also be used on other characters.

        This Charm allows a Dragon-Blood to analyze another
        character and see what external influences there are
        over his mind; this includes low-Willpower compulsions,
        mind-affecting sorcery or Charms and/or derangements. A
        Perception + Medicine roll is called for here, with a
        difficulty of 2. Should this roll be successful, the Exalt can
        detect any external influences on the target. With four or
        more successes, she can trace magical influences backward
        to their source. The Exalted cannot use this Charm on
        herself, as one's mind often proves too nimble for cogent
        self-analysis. This Charm cannot diagnose or help in the
        treatment of the Great Curse.

        With a strike of the palm and a touch of the lips, an
        Exalted with this level of mastery over the medicinal arts
        can remove the pain of insanity or external influence from
        the Charm's subject. The Dragon-Blood must have first
        used Madness-Analyzing Stare to learn the source of the
        subject's mental problems - whether it be madness,
        compulsion or sorcerous meddling. This Charm must be
        used repeatedly if its subject suffers from multiple sources
        of mental influence. Purity of Mind Method works to
        counteract only sorcery spells of instant duration — ones
        whose effects are still ongoing must be targeted with
        Emerald Countermagic. Like Madness-Analyzing Stare,
        this Charm is powerless in the face of the Great Curse.

        Dynasts in the Cathak legions developed this Charm
        as a means of retrieving fallen comrades from the field of
        battle. By sending a potent surge of Essence through the
        target's body, the Fire Aspect sparks an incapacitated
        target into furious action for three turns for every success
        on a Strength + Medicine roll. The target does not regain
        consciousness and cannot take actions of his own, so the
        Exalt using this Charm must guide the target's somewhat
        uncoordinated running, but the target can move at his
        maximum speed for the duration of this Charm, provided
        the Exalt guides him around obstacles. Targets affected by
        this Charm are, albeit only briefly, stabilized and will not
        lose blood again until three turns after the Charm concludes.
        If the target takes damage beyond the maximum
        dictated by his Stamina while this Charm is in effect, he
        dies the moment the Charm concludes.&lt;br&gt;
        For the rules on death and dying, see page 233 of
        Exalted.

        The Exalt can call upon her own Essence to draw
        truly outstanding performances from within. Whether
        the performance is music, theater or another performing
        art, the character enhances her talent with this
        Charm. The character can add two dice to her Performance
        dice pool for every mote of Essence spent. She
        can no more than double her Performance Ability with
        this Charm, and if she wishes to add just a single die (for
        example, if she has an odd Performance score) she must
        spend a full mote to get it.

        the character is never in serious danger when performing
        onstage. If the player spends the necessary Essence immediately
        upon making a Performance roll, she can reroll it at
        once. This must be done before the Storyteller describes the
        general success or failure of her attempt. She must take the
        second result, no matter what it is. If this Charm is part of a
        Combo, the other Charms in the Combo must be paid for a
        second time when Talented Improvisation is used, but if they
        require dice rolls, those rolls cannot be remade.

        Occasionally, a Dragon-Blooded warrior has no choice
        but to engage in combat in a crowded area or finds himself in
        another situation in which he does not want to be seen
        fighting: Perhaps an ally's mind has been subverted by an evil
        sorcerer, and the Exalt must subdue the ally without letting
        Political enemies know of his circle's internal strife. Regardless
        of the reason, this Charm lets a combatant hide his actions
        and those of a foe within what appears to be stage combat.
        Simply spend the necessary Essence to activate this Charm,
        and most observers will not realize that the ongoing battle is
        not for show alone, no matter how implausible the circumstances
        seem. If the Exalted faces many enemies simultaneously,
        he can extend this cover to include them so long as they are
        extras: He spends one additional mote per extra. He cannot
        extend such cover over a group of characters that are not
        extras, nor can he extend his cover to protect any allies of his
        that show up. This Charm will not fool characters with
        Essence higher than the character using the Charm.

        At this level of mastery, the Dragon-Blood's performances
        become so awe-inspiring, so staggeringly beautiful,
        that she can insinuate minor suggestions into audience
        members who behold them. If the suggestions violate individual
        audience members' Natures, then those viewers will
        not obey them; more generally, the suggestions must be the
        sorts of things that won't bring the audience to any real harm.
        They might find themselves more willing to travel to a
        particular part of town at a particular time or to buy their goods
        from a particular merchant or to trust a particular leader more
        than they would otherwise. Only one sort of performance can
        violate the rule against bringing audience members to obvious
        harm, and that is a performance designed to incite a riot.
        Perhaps obviously, this is just as dangerous to the Exalt as it is
        to the audience members and should not be attempted lightly.
        The player must spend the necessary Essence and
        Willpower to enact this Charm, and she must also roll
        Charisma + Performance. With a basic success, the character
        can instill a simple suggestion into a small crowd; the
        group will remember where they got the idea. For each
        additional success, the crowd can be somewhat larger:
        Three successes implies a crowd of hundreds and five a
        crowd of thousands. Additionally, if the character sacrifices
        one success, the crowd will not remember where they
        received the suggestion that spurred their mass activity.

            The songs of the Dragon-Blooded can inspire even
            the most slovenly unit to incredible feats of endurance. As
            her unit sets out upon the road (the song must be started
            with the march), the Terrestrial raises her voice in song,
            singing tales of the unit's glory, the prodigious feats it has
            accomplished and the justified vengeance it is going to
            wreak upon the enemy when it arrives. As she sings, her
            soldiers find their loads lightened, their resolve stiffened
            and the journey less onerous.&lt;br&gt;
            So long as she continues singing, her unit gains a
            number of automatic successes equal to her Permanent
            Essence - 2 (minimum 1) on all fatigue checks, and its rate
            of travel is doubled. This feat can only be performed for
            infantry units, and a single Dragon-Blooded can only
            affect a number of fangs equal to her permanent Essence +
            2, but the Charm is synergistic (see p. 45). Motes spent on
            this Charm are committed — a Dragon-Blood can keep
            the Charm working for a number of hours equal to her
            permanent Essence + Stamina.

            a training plan developed by Charms higher in this tree.
            With the Charm in effect, the Exalt can flawlessly lead
            drills, impart knowledge and teach classes without error.
            A single Dragon-Blooded can train a number of
            fangs equal to his Permanent Essence, but this Charm is
            synergistic (see p. 45) — groups of Terrestrials working
            in concert can train large units of troops quickly. Each
            use of this Charm requires a training program or protocol
            developed with the Peerless Training Method
            Protocols or other Charms — a Dragon-Blooded can
            memorize a number of training programs at one time
            equal to his permanent Essence. While this Charm is in
            use, 1 mote of Essence per fang trained is committed to
            its continued operation - these motes are released

            Prerequisite Charms: Flawless Training Execution&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;
            During the First Age, the Dragon-Blooded relied
            on the Celestial Exalted and their superior training
            methods to bring knowledge to the people and acted as
            facilitators, rather than designers, of training programs.
            When the Usurpation was being planned, the
            Terrestrial Exalted developed this family of Charms as
            a way to secretly train commandos and soldiers for
            their war, and the Dragon-Bloods have continued to
            refine the process ever since.&lt;br&gt;
            Like the Sense-Destroying Methods, this Charm is
            actually a family of Charms that work in an identical
            fashion — five examples of the Charms available are listed
            in the Protocols sidebar on this page, but others are known,
            and more can be developed as needed. Using one of these
            Charms, a skilled Dragon-Blood can develop a training
            program to improve those undergoing the program in
            specific areas — she can teach civilians how to be soldiers,
            teach disaster recovery techniques or impart the fundamentals
            of nearly any task.&lt;br&gt;
            To use these Charms, the Terrestrial develops a
            training program — this requires one week, minus one
            day for each dot of permanent Essence over 2 (so a
            Dragon-Blooded with Essence 4 can develop a training
            program in five days). At the end of this time, the
            Charm's user commits the plan to record on paper, and
            his player rolls the character's Intelligence + Performance,
            against a difficulty of 4. If the Charm is successful,
            the plan will raise one Ability listed to 3, two Abilities to
            2 and the remaining Abilities to 1 each, add one dot to
            an Attribute listed and raise one of the Virtues listed by
            one. Extra successes can be used to buy specialties for the
            Abilities raised - each extra success equals one specialty.
            No more than two specialties can be gained in this
            fashion. A failed roll indicates a training plan that simply
            will not work — the time and Essence spent is lost. A
            botched roll indicates a training plan that is subtly flawed
            in some fashion — it cannot work, but this will not
            become evident until it is implemented in the field by
            being used by someone with the Flawless Training Ex-
            ecution Charm. This will typically be noticeable within
            the first week of training, but particularly bad botches
            may take weeks to become evident.&lt;br&gt;
            The Abilities gained by this Charm are not additive
            - if a character has more dots in that Ability than the
            training program would provide, she gains no benefit
            (though she may still gain any attached specialties, if she
            has less than three). These Charms cannot raise Attributes
            above 3, Virtues above 2 or Willpower above 8 (these stats
            can be raised later through experience). A given character
            can only benefit from a single Charm in this tree once but
            can be the recipient of multiple different Charms (so a
            character could receive the Combat Drill Protocol and
            then the Officer Readiness Training Protocol). This Charm
            has no effect whatsoever on individuals with an Essence
            higher than 1.&lt;br&gt;
            Each training program is unique and can only be
            used once — if a developer wants to hand a training
            program to two subordinates, he must use this Charm

        The hoofbeats of a steed whose rider employs this
        Charm strike the ground as quickly and lightly as pearls
        falling from a broken necklace. The mount's speed for the
        turn is increased by the rider's Ride Ability in yards.
        Additionally, the rider receives two additional dice for
        Ride checks, as his Essence-enhanced steed handles obstacles
        with ease. These bonus dice do not raise the Ride
        Ability for purposes of attacking while mounted.

        With the aid of this Charm, a rider and steed pair can
        clear prodigious distances with a single jump, safely landing
        leaps that seemed if not impossible, then certainly unwise.
        With room to run, two successes on a Charisma + Ride roll
        will let the mount safely jump one half its movement for the
        turn when jumping for distance. Standing jump, or jumping
        vertically, either up or down, will modify both distance and
        difficulty at the Storyteller's discretion.

        A mount emboldened with this Charm does not
        actually take to the skies, but its feet barely brush the
        ground. So quickly does the beast move that it is capable
        of running over water, deep snow, loose sand or sharp,
        scree-covered slopes without the slightest difficulty. Rapid
        ascent and descent are also made trivially easy and may be
        done at the mount's full speed. A successful Dexterity +
        Ride roll is necessary to invoke the Charm. The mount's
        movement rate for the turn is doubled, and no environmental
        Ride check penalties apply. Both mount and rider
        will still take damage from harmful local environments,
        such as riding over a pool of lava.

        The simple advantages of height and mobility enjoyed
        by a mounted swordsman wreak havoc on the
        battlefield. Exalted cavalry are even more terrifying, translating
        their mounts' great speed and strength into carnage
        in the opposing ranks. With a successful Dexterity + Ride
        roll, the Dragon-Blooded rider can add up to his Ride skill
        in extra damage dice to hand-to-hand attacks. Archery
        and Thrown attacks are not affected by this Charm. This
        Charm can explicitly be included in Combos with Charms

        Only the Exalted dare to stand and meet this deadly

        rider gathers cavalry to her side, pays the Essence cost of 1
        mote per ally and mount (including herself and her steed)
        and forges the unit into a thunderous charge that moves
        across the field of battle as one. Where the charge hits
        enemy lines, pikes snap, shields crack and defenders fall
        while the charge rides through unscathed. Every member
        of the charge attacks on the leader's initiative, and the
        charge's attacks are resolved before any delayed attack
        actions on the part of the defenders. Any defender who
        suffers damage but is not knocked unconscious or killed
        must immediately make a Ride or Athletics check to avoid
        being dismounted or knocked down. Defenders who retain
        their lives and their feet may then attack normally. The
        Exalt must ride with the group, which cannot number
        more than 5 x the character's permanent Essence.

        The beasts typically chosen for mounts are (with the
        possible exception of the ass) generally considered to be
        brave, solid creatures. Still, even stout courage may not be
        enough when the mount comes face to face with the dangers
        a Dragon-Blood will invariably encounter fulfilling her duties
        as a Prince of the Earth. Using this Charm, an Exalt rider can
        bolster her mount's natural bravery with her Essence, spiritually
        blurring the line between rider and steed. The Exalt's
        player makes a Charisma + Ride roll; each success guarantees
        a turn during which the mount will not bolt or flee no matter
        the danger unless commanded to do so by her rider. The
        Dragon-Blood also does not need to devote an action to
        controlling the mount. No matter the provocation, the beast
        responds exactly as trained, without hesitation. Finally, during
        the Charm's duration, the rider cannot be removed from
        her steed's back while the Charm lasts by force or by accident.
        A failed or botched Ride check may result in the loss of
        actions, but the Exalt will remain on her mount's back unless
        she chooses to dismount - thereby ending the Charm.

        Prerequisite Charms: Great Heart Companion&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The great beastmasters of the Dragon-Blooded do not
        restrict themselves to average mounts. Fierce bears, big-toothed
        cats and even river dragons have served as steeds to
        the Elemental Dragon of Wood's children. Such impressive
        creatures are never broken without an epic battle of will,
        magic and stamina, however. Activating this Charm allows
        the Dragon-Blood to distill what would be painstaking days or
        weeks of training into one tumultuous encounter. The Exalt's
        player rolls Charisma + Ride, while the intended mount
        resists with its Stamina + Willpower. The Storyteller sets the
        specifics of the task at his discretion, but expect an extended,
        difficult test and a few bruises or worse along the way.
        Breaking a flying creature such as a hybroc or a notoriously
        vicious one such as a tyrant lizard in this manner carries the
        very real possibility of a messy end. Nevertheless, once the test
        is won, the creature is immediately compliant and trainable
        (by the Dragon-Blood at least). A final note — this Charm
        does not protect the rider from a beast who rebels after a period
        of mistreatment. Such fierce-natured beasts may fight to the
        death rather than submit again to a cruel master.

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        As one might expect, the Dragon-Blooded attuned to
        Fire can shape that unstable element with preternatural skill.
        This Charm displays that power in a comparatively subtle
        way. The character starts a fire; the method doesn't matter.
        If the fire has suitable fuel, it will spread, as fires do. This fire,
        however, spreads only along a path predefined by its creator
        along invisible threads of Essence. For instance, a Fire-attuned
        character could drop a torch on a forest floor littered
        with dry leaves and have the fire burn in a narrow line, not
        even scorching the leaves near the defined path or setting the
        trees on fire. Applications include barriers of flame to restrict
        and channel a fight, or a form of time-delayed arson.
        The fire can last a full hour, fuel permitting. At the
        end of that time, the Dragon-Blood can extinguish magic-bound
        fire, if he so desires. If the character is no longer
        present to restrain the fire, it burns out of control to the
        extent that its fuel permits.&lt;br&gt;
        The player rolls Intelligence + Survival for the character
        to lay the threads of Essence. The basic Precise Fire
        extends through 25 square feet, in whatever simple shape
        the character desires. For instance, the Dynast could
        create a wall of fire one foot wide and 25 feet long, a solid
        square five feet on a side, a foot-thick ring eight feet in
        diameter and so on. For every extra success, the area is
        increased by an additional 25 square feet, but the character
        cannot benefit from more successes than she has points of
        permanent Essence. The Storyteller may also impose difficulty
        penalties if the character wants to burn a particularly
        complicated shape, such as writing a person's name in fire.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • The basic Charm requires that the Dragon-Blooded
        character light the fire by hand. With greater skill and
        power, a character could initiate Precise Fires using fires
        someone else set, or from a distance. For instance, a
        character could shoot a flame arrow to start a Precise Fire
        far away, or send flames leaping from an enemy's campfire.&lt;br&gt;
        • A more powerful character could make the flames
        burn even in areas without suitable fuel. Whatever's avail-
        able, burns.

        A Wood-attuned character can attune herself to the
        Essence of trees, grasses, briars and other plant life around
        her. While thus attuned, she can pass through dense
        vegetation without any penalty to her movement or combat.
        Somehow, the crowding, tangling plants never seem
        to be exactly where the character is. Not only does this
        make it easier to pursue animals or fugitives through
        undergrowth, briars or other hindrances, the Dragon-Blooded
        character enjoys a considerable advantage over
        an enemy if she fights in such surroundings.&lt;br&gt;
        Cascade Charms:&lt;br&gt;
        • A more experienced or powerful Wood-attuned
        character could extend the effect of the Forest Passage
        Method to other characters, for a suitably increased Essence
        cost.&lt;br&gt;
        • A variation using Stealth instead of Survival makes
        a person virtually invisible, silent and undetectable while
        within forest, scrub or shrubbery.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Exalt using this Charm calls upon his superior

        his relationship to the Elemental Pole of Wood in
        particular, to improve his chance of survival in hostile
        environments. The Dragon-Blood can improve his Survival
        dice pools by two dice for every mote of Essence
        spent, but can no more than double his Survival Ability.
        The character must spend a full mote of Essence
        even if he wishes to add just a single die (as might be the
        case if he has an odd Survival score).

        The Exalt with this Charm is able to beg a brief favor
        of the spirits of the natural world when he has given offense
        or behaved in an inappropriate manner before them. In so
        doing, he may be able to correct prior mistakes, although
        there is always the chance that he will instead give further
        offense. Immediately after a Survival roll, the Dragon-Blood's
        player may spend 2 motes of Essence and reroll. He
        must accept the second roll. If this Charm is part of a
        Combo, the character must pay all the Essence necessary
        to activate associated Charms again, even if they do not
        contribute to the rerolled pool.

        &lt;br&gt;
        With this Charm, the Exalted can track the passage
        of nearly any creature that is not using magic (such as
        Trail Concealing Measurement, below) to hide signs of
        its passing. The character needs only to spend the required
        Essence, and signs of his quarry's passage stand out
        to the character's eyes: Animal tracks and spoor become
        much more prominent, and the broken twigs and other
        signs that reveal a human's passage are quite clear. The
        tracker's player must make a simple Perception + Survival
        roll and acquire only a single success to keep on his
        prey's trail, regardless of the conduciveness of the local
        terrain and weather to tracking. The character cannot
        follow a trail more than a week old with this Charm. If the
        target is using Trail Concealing Measurement or some
        other wilderness Charm that makes her untrackable
        without magical aid, then this Charm counts as such aid.
        Under such circumstances, the tracking Exalt's player
        may make a normal Survival roll to track the target but
        does not gain this Charm's normal mechanical bonus.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Exalted using Trail Concealing Measurement
        knows instinctually how to hide signs of his passage. He
        does this so skillfully that mortal trackers and those without
        Quarry Revelation Technique (above) or other magical
        means of tracking him are unable to do so. Players of beings
        with magical means to pursue the character make normal
        rolls to track the character. It is rumored by those who have
        traveled close to the Wyld that the Lunar Exalted are not
        fooled by this Charm at all when they wear animal shapes.

        during the scene that it is active. Whether alone or as part
        of a group, when the Dragon-Blood with this Charm sets
        off to find food, he (and his group, if applicable) will find
        twice as much food as the level of success on their Survival
        rolls would otherwise imply.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm enables an Exalt and his companions to
        avoid the worst effects of hostile environments. In a hot
        environment, the Exalted leading the group uses this
        Charm to make sure he and his fellows remain out of the
        worst heat of the sun and conserve water. In a cold
        environment, he makes sure they conserve body heat as
        well as possible and remain moving to avoid frostbite.
        When Hostile Environment Preparation Method is active,
        the group can be assumed to be unharmed by any
        environment that would ordinarily require three or fewer
        successes on a Survival roll. Environments that would
        require four or more successes now require three fewer
        successes, so even the most hostile natural environment
        only requires two successes on a Survival roll. The Charm's
        base 3 motes cost protects the Exalt. Every additional
        mote spent protects a single traveling companion. An
        Exalt cannot protect more individuals with this Charm
        than his permanent Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The character calls upon helpful spirits of Wood
        (and, if appropriate, other elements) to help him build
        a remarkably robust, protective and comfortable shelter
        even in the worst environment. For a group traveling in
        the forest, the Exalted can create a wooden hut in a
        matter of about 30 minutes. Those traveling in the
        desert can find themselves in a sheltered outcropping,
        shaded from above and with plenty of room for wind to
        flow through. A character in the Far North may build an
        igloo or other hard-packed snow shelter in about 30
        minutes. These shelters will last no more than a day, as
        they are somewhat magical in nature. Generally, the
        shelter the character builds can hold around six human-sized
        creatures; if the Exalted wishes to build a larger
        shelter, he must spend an additional mote of Essence per
        person to be accommodated within it.

        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        As mentioned previously, a basic part of Immaculate
        training is that of interacting with the spirit world. The
        first step in this training is to comprehend how to perceive
        the spirit world. This ability is gained as part of the basic
        training of a Dragon Path, whether the Exalt becomes an
        Immaculate during character creation or joins the Order
        later in life. Possessing it is a requirement for learning the
        Charms on the Dragon Path.&lt;br&gt;
        The practical upshot of this is that by spending a
        single mote of Essence, an Immaculate can perceive spirits
        and incorporeal beings. Normally invisible spiritualized
        beings become visible to the Spirit Walker. This power
        lasts for an entire scene — or until the Exalt consciously
        reattunes herself to the normal world. Reattuning to the
        normal world is a dice action.&lt;br&gt;
        Tuning in to the spirit world does tend to distract
        one from the concerns of the material one though. The
        Exalt invoking this ability suffers a +1 to the difficulty
        of any activity relating to the corporeal world while
        using Spirit Sight.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Immaculates are widely known for their ability
        to interact with and combat spirits. By merely concentrating
        for a moment, a properly trained Dragon-blood
        can do more than just see the spirit world. She can &amp;quot;Spirit
        Walk,&amp;quot; mystically attuning herself to the spirit world on
        a physical level.
        This Charm allows the Immaculates who know it to
        interact with spirits as if they were normal corporeal
        beings. Physical damage dealt by a Spirit Walker that
        would normally pass right through a spirit's immaterial
        form affects it as if the spirit were flesh and blood, as do
        the Charms and abilities of the Exalted. The Immaculate
        is still in the physical world, however, and has to deal
        with any physical limitations that may apply. Also,
        unless the Immaculate uses Spirit Sight, she cannot see
        dematerialized spirits.
        Spirit Walking puts the character truly in tune with
        both the spiritual world and the corporeal one. When
        Spirit Walking is used with Spirit Sight, the +1 penalty to
        difficulties for physical world action is negated.

        &lt;br&gt;
        To one fully in tune with the movements of the
        mercurial Air, sight is no longer a necessity. Immaculates
        learning this discipline attune themselves to the ebb and
        flow of their patron element. The awareness of the martial
        artist invoking this Charm become supernaturally acute,
        as the slightest eddy of current in the air speaks volumes to
        her. The minutest disturbance in the air warns her easily
        of any danger. For the remainder of the scene, the Immaculate
        cannot be surprised or ambushed and is considered
        aware of any attacks against her.&lt;br&gt;
        Outside of combat, this Charm is used as a focusing
        tool and has an additional benefit. In addition to all-around
        awareness, the character may add her Essence to
        any Awareness roll, as long as she takes a minute to stand
        perfectly still and feel the Dragon's breath.

        Not every blow struck by the Immaculates is intended
        to kill. The disciples of the Air Dragon have a special
        maneuver that rains a series of carefully placed blows down
        upon an enemy, actually driving the air from his lungs and
        potentially knocking him unconscious.&lt;br&gt;
        When this blow is struck, do not figure damage as
        normal. Instead, roll the Immaculate's Strength + Martial
        Arts against the target's Stamina + Endurance in a reflexive
        opposed test. Each success the Immaculate's player
        rolls gives his opponent a - 1 penalty for a number of turns
        equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts. The impairment
        inflicted by this Charm can accumulate over multiple
        applications. If the target's impairment from this Charm
        ever equals double her Stamina, she is rendered unconscious
        for the rest of the scene.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm only works on creatures that must breathe
        to survive. Automatons, the undead, spirits and other
        beings without the need to breathe are totally unaffected
        by it, as are beings under the influence of magic that
        removes the necessity for breathing.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The realm of the Air Dragon is the realm of hidden
        things, concealed secrets and quiet movement. By gathering
        the element of Air about her, an Air Dynast
        emulates the Air Dragon. The air itself wraps around the
        Immaculate, shrouding the Exalt from view. For the
        character's Martial Arts score in turns, she is rendered
        invisible. It is possible to invoke this Charm while being
        watched — or even while in hand-to-hand combat!
        However, those watching may be able to guess where the
        character has gone. This Charm is best used while those
        looking at the character are distracted, and many Air
        Dragons carry a supply of flash bombs, blinding powders,
        etc. for just that purpose.&lt;br&gt;
        Enemies may attempt a reflexive Perception + Awareness
        roll each turn to spot the Immaculate. If the observer
        saw the Dragon-Blood disappear, spotted the Dragon-Blooded
        last turn or witnessed an attack launched by the
        character, the difficulty for the check is only 1. However,
        the difficulty increases by one every turn that the character
        remains undetected, to a maximum of 5. If the
        observer has some reason to believe that someone is
        around (a knocked over vase, footprints in the sand) the
        difficulty for spotting the character starts at 3 and scales
        up. Just casually looking for the shrouded Immaculate has
        a difficulty of 5. Even when spotted, any actions taken
        against the Dynast are at a +2 difficulty.

        With a quick series of hand movements cutting the air
        in front of him and a deep cleansing breath, the Immaculate
        Dragon matches his breathing to that of the Air
        Dragon itself. This Charm requires a successful Dexterity
        + Martial Arts roll, representing the successful execution
        of the form itself. If the roll fails, the Charm has no effect,
        and the motes invested in it are unspent, but the character's
        action is wasted for the turn.&lt;br&gt;
        If the invocation of the Air Dragon Form is success-
        ful, the Exalt may add her Martial Arts to her Ability
        total for any ranged attack or dodge attempt she makes
        for the rest of the scene. This can no more than double
        the Ability the Immaculate is using to make the ranged
        attack or dodge and is applied before any penalties for
        splitting her dice pool. If she wishes, the character may
        reflexively dodge attacks with her Martial Arts score.
        The above benefits are specifically cumulative with and
        independent of any other Charms or anima powers
        invoked by the Immaculate.

        By infusing an attack with a tiny bit of the gusting
        breath of the Air Dragon, an Immaculate can send a
        target flying backward. An attack boosted by Avenging
        Wind Strike is rolled as a normal attack, and damage is
        figured normally — with one extra effect. After being hit,
        the target's player must immediately make a reflexive
        Strength + Athletics roll. The target is blown the Exalted's
        Martial Arts x 10 yards, -5 yards per success on the
        Athletics roll. This effect occurs whether or not the
        Immaculate's strike actually does any damage to the
        target. Obviously additional damage could occur of the
        victim is blown off a cliff, into a lava pit, etc.
        This Charm can be used with hand-to-hand or ranged
        attacks. Many an opponent has laughed as a seemingly
        harmless chakram sped toward her, only to suffer the wrath
        of the Avenging Wind Strike.

        With a mighty Essence-focusing shout, a savage
        blast of wind issues from the character's mouth, wreaking
        havoc on objects and beings caught in the gale. The
        wrath affects a 90 degree arc directly in front of the
        Immaculate, out to a distance of her Essence rating x 10
        feet. The player of anyone standing even partially in the
        area of effect must make a reflexive Strength + Athletics
        roll against a difficulty equal to the Exalt's Martial Arts.&lt;br&gt;
        If the roll fails, the character is knocked off his feet. Any
        concentration is shattered, and his player must make a
        Wits + Resistance roll. A target whose player fails to get
        at least a single success is stunned for the next turn, his
        entire action taken up with clearing his head and regaining
        his balance.&lt;br&gt;
        By spending a point of Willpower when activating the
        Charm, the Aspect of Air can turn it into a much more
        precise weapon, focusing the Wrathful Winds to hit a
        single target. This target is automatically hit unless he has
        some sort of impenetrable defense with which to block the
        attack. The target takes the Exalt's Strength + Essence in
        lethal damage from the sudden blast of air, which can be
        soaked only with Stamina and other non-armor defenses.
        In addition, his player must make the regular reflexive
        Strength + Athletics roll for the character to keep his feet,
        but the difficulty is increased to the attacking Exalt's
        Strength + Essence. The range remains the martial artist's
        Essence x 10 feet.

        movement rate is doubled, as is the distance that he can
        leap. Also, the character need not actually set foot on solid
        ground to continue moving. A cloud-treading Dragon-Blooded
        could easily scamper up a trail of smoke, across the
        surface of a lake or leap across treetops, his feet touching
        only the flimsiest branches.&lt;br&gt;
        The character must keep moving while crossing such
        delicate surfaces; if the Exalt pauses for even a moment,
        gravity takes over. This does not mean that a character
        must end each turn on a solid surface. As long as he
        continues moving into the next turn, a character may
        also immediately invoke Cloud Treading Method again
        without penalty, assuming he has enough motes to use
        the Charm again.&lt;br&gt;
        Cloud treading heroes can take offensive and other
        actions during their movement as long as the normal
        penalties for attacking while moving are applied. The
        Storyteller may increase the difficulty of any action at her
        discretion, depending on circumstance.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The realm of the Air Dragon is the realm of the
        storm, and its disciples can tap into the force of this to
        belabor their opponents. After a moment of centering
        and a few deep breaths, the Immaculate brings her hands
        together. The resultant clap of thunder can stun and
        deafen those who hear it.&lt;br&gt;
        Players of those within the Exalt's Essence x 10
        yards of the Thunderclap Kata must make a reflexive
        Stamina + Resistance roll with a difficulty equal to the
        character's Essence. Characters whose players get even
        a single success manage to cover their ears in time -
        but they lose any further action for the rest of the turn
        as a consequence. Those whose players failed take
        bashing damage equal to the Immaculate's Strength +
        Martial Arts, which can be soaked only with Stamina
        and other non-armor protection. In addition, they are
        also deafened for a number of turns equal to the
        Immaculate's Essence and, during that time, suffer a
        penalty to all actions equal to the attacking character's
        Essence from disorientation.&lt;br&gt;
        Obviously, this Charm does not affect those without
        the need to hear — with one very important exception.
        While normal beings are susceptible to the Thunderclap
        Kata, it has an even greater effect on spirit beings. All this
        Charm's effects are doubled against spirits, whether materialized
        or not. The Immaculate does not need to be Spirit
        Walking to gain this benefit and, in fact, does not even
        have to know that a spirit is present.
        The Dragon-Blooded is also immune to her own
        Thunderclap Kata and may invest 1 extra mote per being
        to insulate her compatriots from its effects. Spirits can't be
        insulated in this manner.

        When this Charm is invoked, blue and white flickers
        of electricity arc across the character's body, lighting his
        face in an eerie glow. When the character punches or
        kicks, brilliant strokes of lightening lance from his feet or
        fingertips, striking distant opponents as if the Immaculate
        was standing toe to toe with them.&lt;br&gt;
        For the Charm's duration, the character can make
        martial arts attacks out to a distance of his Essence x 10
        feet, and the attacks do lethal damage equal to the
        character's Strength + Essence. Martial arts weapons add
        to the accuracy and damage of these attacks, as normal.

        The Exalt becomes a whirlwind of speed and mayhem
        for the duration of the Charm. While using the Hurricane
        Combat Method, the Immaculate adds her Martial Arts
        total to her initiative and all dodge rolls (use her Martial
        Arts alone if she has no other dodge pool), triples her
        movement and doubles her possible jumping height. It also
        allows her to make at number of extra martial arts or ranged
        attacks equal to her permanent Essence rating every turn.&lt;br&gt;
        The health level cost of this Charm is not paid until
        the Charm has expired. The Willpower point and motes
        must be paid up front as normal. The character can end this
        Charm prematurely at the end of any turn. Obviously, care
        should be taken when invoking this Charm. Used by a
        weakened Exalt, the consequences can be deadly.

        The power of the earth is massive indeed, bearing as
        it does the entire weight of Creation. Martial artists of the
        Path of Earth can channel some of that power through
        their bodies and into their opponents. The Exalted takes
        a moment to center himself, then unleashes a powerful
        blow. The Immaculate may add his Essence to the damage
        of the next Melee, Brawl or Martial Arts attack he lands.
        If the blow is with a weapon, the character must pay an
        additional point of Essence to channel the power of the
        earth through it— unless the weapon in question is the
        Earth Dragon's signature weapon, the seven section staff.&lt;br&gt;
        This attack can also affect dematerialized spirits as if
        they were material. Obviously, the character must be using
        Spirit Sight to see the spirit and thus attack it.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is a combination of martial arts move and
        meditative technique. The disciples of the Earth Dragon
        can often be seen standing as still as statues in the gardens
        of the Cloister of Wisdom, for while invoking this Charm,
        a martial artist's body takes on the very stillness and
        semblance of stone.&lt;br&gt;
        But aside from its meditative function, the Unmoving
        Mountain Stance has applications in combat. Displacing
        a monk invoking the stance is no easy task. For the
        purposes of the Immaculate holding his ground or keeping
        from being knocked down, treat her permanent Essence as
        automatic successes in any contested roll to displace her.
        Fighting opponents using this Charm can be a disconcerting
        experience, as they simply refuse to be knocked off
        their feet no matter what sort of mayhem is applied to
        them. They are immune to all knockback or knockdown
        effects as well.&lt;br&gt;
        The Charm also has some non-combat advantages. If
        an Earth Immaculate is attempting to hide, the ability to
        remain absolutely still and silent can be a great boon.
        Assuming the Immaculate has found an appropriate hiding
        place and is totally still, any attempt to locate her by
        hearing, sound, body heat, etc. must overcome the
        character's Essence in automatic opposing successes.

        With the invocation of this Charm, the Exalt's skin
        briefly becomes as hard as the stony hide of the Earth
        Dragon. The Immaculate's Martial Arts Ability acts as
        armor against both lethal and bashing damage for the rest
        of the turn. The martial artist may also parry weapons with
        his bare hands without the use of a stunt. This Charm may
        only be used once per turn.

        By executing a series of katas, the Earth Immaculate
        comes into true contact with the Earth Dragon and can
        directly channel some of its power. For the remainder of
        the scene after successful invocation of the Earth Dragon
        Form, the Exalt adds his Martial Arts to his bashing and
        lethal soaks against any attack. This armor even applies
        to aggravated damage, which cannot normally be soaked.&lt;br&gt;
        Invoking the form also requires a successful Dexterity
        + Martial Arts roll. If the roll fails, the motes for this
        Charm are not spent, but the action is wasted. The
        above benefits are cumulative with any other Charms or
        anima powers invoked by the Immaculate. Only one
        Form-type Charm can be used at any one time. Invoking
        a Form-type Charm immediately terminates the benefits
        of any other Form-type Charm the character may
        have active.

        The raw power of the elemental Earth is fearsome to
        behold. By channeling this power into his body, an Im-
        maculate can create a great deal of destruction. This
        Charm doubles the Exalt's raw damage for the purposes of
        destroying objects. This boost lasts for the character's
        Martial Arts in turns. The Charm has absolutely no effect
        on the amount of damage that a character does to living
        things. The effect of Shattering Fist Strike stacks with
        other effects, such as a Slayer Khatar's, that increase a
        character's damage against objects.&lt;br&gt;
        Great care is taken in training disciples in how to use
        this Charm properly, as careless use can be dangerous.
        Even though the Charm does not affect living beings,
        improper application can cause damage to the character
        indirectly. For example, if an Exalt were to use Shattering
        Fist Strike on a pillar supporting the roof, he would
        probably be crushed. The Storyteller should apply appropriate
        damage in these situations.

        This maneuver can be attempted either bare handed
        or with martial arts weapons. Roll normally to parry an
        attack. If the roll succeeds, the character has successfully
        captured the weapon between her hands or with her
        weapon. Her player immediately makes a reflexive Strength
        + Martial Arts roll. This roll is difficulty 1 for normal
        weapons but difficulty 3 for exceptional weapons and 5 for
        weapons forged from the Five Magical Materials. If the roll
        succeeds, the weapon the character was attacked with is
        broken, shattered or otherwise rendered useless. Even if
        the Immaculate fails to break the weapon, the weapon's
        owner's player must succeed in a reflexive opposed Strength
        + Athletics test with the Immaculate player's or be immediately
        disarmed. The cost of this Charm is a number of
        motes of Essence equal to the difficulty of the roll to break
        the weapon, and is paid before the parry attempt is made.&lt;br&gt;
        Weapons affected by this Charm are not totally destroyed,
        just rendered immediately useless. They can
        typically be repaired or reforged given time and skill.

        small amount of Earth Essence into the target. The target is
        paralyzed and completely unable to act for one turn per health
        level of damage suffered in the character's attack. If an
        opponent is reduced below Incapacitated by such an attack,
        he is not only killed, but turned to stone. The character's body
        calcifies into rock, and he remains in that state forever, a
        ghastly trophy to the Immaculate's martial skill.
        This attack cannot be channeled through a
        weapon. The character must actually hit the target
        with her bare hands.

        The Exalted invokes this Charm as he makes a normal
        attack, raining a flurry of blows down upon his opponent,
        driving her to the ground — or at least into some inferior
        defensive posture.&lt;br&gt;
        If the character successfully strikes his opponent,
        make a reflexive opposed roll pitting the Immaculate's
        Strength + Martial Arts against the target's Stamina +
        Athletics. If the target exceeds the character's number of
        successes, she suffers normal damage but no additional
        effect. If the character ties or exceeds the target's successes,
        Earth Essence courses from him into his target's body,
        weighing her down as if beneath the crushing weight of an
        avalanche. For every success he gets, the target suffers a
        one die penalty to all physical tasks so long as the Exalt can
        maintain line of sight to the target. These successes are not
        cumulative if the target is subjected to the Avalanche
        Method on a subsequent turn — only the highest number
        of successes rolled applies.
        If the Exalt accrues more points of impairment than
        the target has points of Stamina, the target is &amp;quot;buried,&amp;quot;
        completely immobilized and unable to take any physical
        action unless released by the Exalt. The Earth Dragon
        Immaculate must maintain physical contact with the
        target to maintain this immobile state. The Exalted can
        take actions as normal, but all physical tasks are at +1
        difficulty, reflecting the inconvenience of maintaining
        contact with the target of the Avalanche Method.
        Earth-aspected Terrestrial Exalted are totally im-
        mune to this Charm, although they may suffer normal
        physical damage from the blow charged with it. This power
        cannot be channeled through weapons.

        To use this Charm, the martial artist must be standing
        on the earth itself or on an earthen surface (stone, masonry,
        etc.). The Immaculate brings her foot down upon
        the ground with a mighty stomp, and the Earth Dragon
        heaves and tosses in response.&lt;br&gt;
        The players of everyone within the invoker's Essence
        x 10 feet must make a reflexive Dexterity + Resistance roll
        with a difficulty equal to the Exalt's Essence as the earth
        shakes and rocks beneath their feet. A character whose
        player fails the roll is thrown violently off his feet and into
        the air, taking one die of bashing damage per point of the
        Immaculate's Martial Arts. This damage is soaked as
        normal. See the rules on knockback and knockdown rules
        on page 234 of the Exalted main rulebook.

        After a moment of focus, the Exalt crouches down and
        seems to simply strike the ground with an open palm. But
        far from being a simple strike, shockwaves ripple through
        the ground toward a target of the character's choice. The
        earth beneath opens up like a gaping maw — then closes
        back up again with immobilizing force.&lt;br&gt;
        The Immaculate's player should roll his character's
        Strength + Martial Arts in a reflexive opposed roll against
        the target's Wits + Athletics. The target's defense roll is
        reflexive. Each success the Immaculate gets causes the
        target a difficulty penalty of + 1 for any physical activity, as
        well as adding one to the Strength rating of the grip of the
        earth. The impairment continues until the target breaks
        free, and until she breaks free, the target may not move
        from the spot at which the Hungry Earth struck her. The
        victim's player may make a Strength + Athletics roll with
        a difficulty equal to the strength of the earth's grip to free
        herself. This escape attempt takes a full action. If the target
        succeeds, she is free of the Hungry Earth.&lt;br&gt;
        If the character manages to actually exceed the target's
        Strength with the strength of the Hungry Earth, the target
        is sucked down into the ground. She may do nothing
        except try to free herself, and the Strength rating of the
        earth's grip is doubled.&lt;br&gt;
        Additional targets can be affected by the Hungry
        Earth Strike for the price of 1 mote per extra target. The
        Immaculate's player makes one Strength + Martial Arts
        roll, while each target's player gets her own Wits + Athletics
        rolls to evade the cracks. The maximum number of
        targets the Exalt can affect is double her Essence. Obviously,
        the subjects of this Charm must be standing on the
        ground to be affected.

        Prerequisite Charms: Weapon-Breaking Defense Technique, Avalanche Method, Hungry Earth Strike&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        With a carefully placed melee strike, the Earth
        Dragon warrior infuses a bit of elemental Earth directly
        into a spirit's form, making it solid enough to be affected
        by his attacks.&lt;br&gt;
        To use this Charm, the Immaculate must first be
        Spirit Walking (see page 242). Upon making a successful
        martial arts attack on a spirit, the martial artist's player
        should roll his character's Wits + Martial Arts in a reflex-
        ive opposed contest against the spirit's permanent
        Willpower. If the martial artist loses the contest, the blow
        has no effect. If he wins this contest, the spirit takes no
        damage, but it is dragged into the material world. The spirit
        must first drain its own Essence to pay for the materialization.
        If the spirit's Essence isn't sufficient, the remainder is
        drained from the character. If the Exalt doesn't have
        enough either, the Essence is still lost from both parties,
        but the spirit remains immaterial.&lt;br&gt;
        The spirit must remain materialized for a number of
        hours equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts Ability. It
        is in all ways a normally materialized spirit that is prohibited
        from dematerializing and can use its Charms as
        normal, assuming it still has enough Essence to do so.
        Should the Immaculate and the spirit tie on the opposed
        roll, the spirit is driven into the material world but need
        remain for only a single turn.&lt;br&gt;
        No spirit likes to be forced into the material
        world, and most spirits are inclined to dramatically
        display this displeasure. Needless to say, Earth-aspected
        Immaculates usually use this move as a prequel to
        destroying the spirit in question.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm has no effect on spirits with permanent
        Essences higher than the Dragon-Blood's.

        Prerequisite Charms: Ghost-Grounding Blow
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is the pinnacle of the Earth Dragon Path,
        representing the Immaculate truly becoming one with the
        Earth Dragon — if only for a short time. The martial artist
        drops to his hands and knees for a few moments, putting
        himself fully in contact with the elemental Earth. The
        Immaculate's body twists and shifts, his skin becoming rough
        and craggy, his body hardening and calcifying. The Dynast
        becomes a being of living stone for the rest of the scene.&lt;br&gt;
        The affects of this are quite dramatic. The character's
        Strength is doubled by the powerful Earth Essence coursing
        through his body, and blows from the character's fists
        become deadly weapons, with Accuracy, Parry and Damage
        ratings equal to the character's permanent Essence and
        a Speed equal to twice the character's permanent Essence.
        The character's unarmed attacks do lethal damage. The
        Immaculate's granite-like skin also gives enormous protection,
        increasing his lethal and bashing soaks by his
        permanent Essence score and allows him to soak lethal
        damage with his entire Stamina. This protection is incompatible
        with armor but works with any other defensive
        Charms that character may be using. The character also
        ignores the penalties of losing health levels. He still takes
        the damage normally but functions as if unwounded until
        incapacitated. If the character is wounded already when
        invoking Perfect Earth Body, those penalties are eliminated,
        although the damage is not healed.

        The damage done by the Searing Fist Attack is not
        that terrible — but the pain is. An attack enhanced by this
        Charm leaves a deep burning sensation where it lands,
        distracting an opponent. The Fire Dragon Immaculate
        focuses his Essence and strikes his opponent, a slight scent
        of brimstone suffusing the air. Figure damage as normal for
        the martial arts attack. A target taking damage from the
        Searing Fist Attack suffers a -1 penalty to his dice pools for
        the rest of the scene. The character must actually do
        damage to his target to inflict this penalty. The effect of
        multiple Searing Fist Attacks is cumulative.

        Flames seem to glow in the eyes of the martial artist
        as she completes a quick series of katas to invoke the
        strength of the Fire Dragon. The Dynast's movements
        afterward are more like the fire she seeks to emulate, and
        she seems to dance beneath attacks aimed at her with
        frightening ease.&lt;br&gt;
        For the remainder of the scene after successful
        invocation of the Fire Dragon form, add the Exalted's
        Martial Arts score as successes to any dodge rolls. This
        bonus is added to each dodge roll separately. The
        character cannot use these successes as a reflexive
        action — in order to dodge an attack, she must still
        either abort to a full dodge or have dedicated actions
        to dodging ahead of time.&lt;br&gt;
        invoking the fire dragon form also requires a
        successful Dexterity + Martial Arts check, representing
        the successful execution of the move itself. If the
        roll fails, the motes for this Charm are not spent, but
        the action is wasted. The above benefits are cumulative
        with any other Charms or anima powers invoked
        by the Immaculate but are not compatible with the use
        of armor.&lt;br&gt;
        Only one Form-type Charm can be invoked at
        any one time. Invoking a new Form-type Charm
        automatically ends the effects of any currently active
        Form-type Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        A successful Fiery Hand Attack does normal damage
        plus the character's Martial Arts rating, as the flaming
        touch sears his enemy. The attack does lethal damage,
        even if it wouldn't normally. Upon striking an opponent,
        the Immaculate's player also reflexively rolls the character's
        Strength + Martial Arts versus the target's Stamina +
        Resistance. A being magically attuned to water may add
        two dice to her roll when resisting this attack. If the target
        wins or ties, the attack has no additional effect on her
        beyond the damage. If a target loses, burning Fire-aspected
        Essence is unleashed upon her, and she bursts into flame.&lt;br&gt;
        While it looks, smells and feels just like normal
        fire, the flames from a Fiery Hand Attack are partially
        magical and can't be doused normally. Only magic or
        the expiration of the Charm kills the flames. If not
        doused, a target set aflame will continue to burn for the
        Exalted's Essence in turns. Treat the fire as a bonfire as
        per the environmental damage rules on page 244 of the
        main Exalted rulebook — every turn, the target's
        player must make a reflexive Stamina + Resistance roll
        at difficulty 3, the character taking 2L damage if the
        roll succeeds or 6L damage if it fails. This damage is
        soaked normally.

        with his Essence rating acting as automatic successes.
        This fiery breath does the character's Essence in lethal

        With a series of quick nerve touches, the Exalt actually
        causes the Essence in his opponent's body to flare,
        potentially causing a great deal of damage. The Immaculate
        makes a martial arts attack as normal, but if he hits, the
        attack does no damage. Instead, for every mote currently
        in a target's Personal Essence pool, he takes one health
        level of lethal damage, up to a maximum of twice the
        Immaculate's permanent Essence. This damage ignores
        armor but may be soaked normally with Stamina and other
        non-armor defenses. Obviously, this Charm is of limited
        use against non-Exalted, but Exalts could potentially suffer
        up to 10 health levels of damage. The target's Essence
        remains totally available, it simply serves as a catalyst for
        the attack and is not reduced.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The power and majesty of a raging conflagration can
        cow even the bravest of hearts. By striking an aggressive
        pose and channeling this aspect of fire, a follower of the
        Fire Dragon can strike fear into lesser foes.&lt;br&gt;
        Attacking a character who is using Overwhelming
        Fire Majesty Stance is not an easy prospect. Anyone able
        to see who tries to attack the Fire Dragon Immaculate must
        subtract the character's Martial Arts rating from their dice
        pools when doing so. Additionally, anyone trying to attack
        those who are clearly allied with the martial artist must
        subtract half that number of dice (rounded down). This
        latter effect has a range equal to the Dynast's Essence in
        yards centered on the Immaculate.&lt;br&gt;
        While maintaining the stance, the Immaculate can
        defend himself and take normal actions, but he may not
        make any attacks or use other Charms. He may also move
        at half his normal speed. If the martial artist is struck and
        suffers any health levels of damage, the stance ends immediately.
        If the character abandons the Overwhelming Fire
        Majesty Stance voluntarily, the effects linger on for a
        single turn after the character drops the stance.

        character manages to damage her opponent, the wound
        smolders like a dying fire. At the beginning of the turn
        following the one in which the Smoldering Wound Attack
        was successful, the victim suffers the same post-soak
        damage that the original attack caused. Soak does not
        apply to this damage, but the damage is rolled normally.

        This Charm enhances the natural anima flare of a Fire
        Exalt. For Aspects of Fire, it triples the fire damage that
        their anima causes. If the character using the Charm is not
        a Fire-aspected Exalted, the Charm causes him to erupt in
        the Aspect of Fire anima power — but without the tripled
        damage. Anyone viewing the invoker is also subject to the
        same effects as if the Exalt was using the Overwhelming
        Fire Majesty Stance, except that the effect doesn't end if
        the character attacks or uses Charms.

        The peculiar liquid, dancing moves of the Water
        Dragon fighting style allows those trained in them to flow
        out of the way of opponent's blows like water. For a number
        of turns following invocation equal to her Essence, subtract
        one die from the martial artist's own attack pools.
        Anyone attempting any attack against the Dragon-Blooded
        during that time subtracts three dice from his pool for that
        action. A character can only benefit from the effects of this
        Charm once at any given time.

        Like ripples emanating from a pebble dropped into
        the glassy surface of water, the force of an attack enhanced
        by Rippling Water Strike spreads outward from the point
        of impact to affect those nearby. The target of the attack
        takes normal damage, but everyone but the Immaculate
        within 10 feet of the target takes bashing damage equal to
        the successes rolled on the damage roll - if the target takes
        no health levels of damage, there is no ripple damage. This
        bashing damage can be soaked as normal and cannot be
        converted to lethal.&lt;br&gt;
        The Immaculate cannot be selective about who is
        affected by the Rippling Water Strike. Friends are as
        susceptible as foes.

        The body, as anyone can see, contains a lot of water
        - blood. Dragon-Blooded warriors who learn the hidden
        tides and currents of blood can strike in such a way as to
        cause internal bleeding into an enemy's lungs. The victim
        can literally drown in his own blood.&lt;br&gt;
        To use this Charm, the attacker makes a successful
        Martial Arts attack against his opponent, which does no
        damage. However, if the attack succeeds, the Immaculate's
        player then rolls a reflexive opposed test of the Exalt's
        Strength + Martial Arts against the target's Stamina +
        Resistance. If the Immaculate wins the contest, the target
        loses one point of Stamina for as many turns as the player
        rolled extra successes. Though the Drowning-in-Blood
        Technique itself does not inflict health levels of damage,
        it may look like a series of rapid-fire punches or some other
        attack. Subsequent uses of the Charm are cumulative. A
        character whose Stamina reaches zero from the effects of
        this Charm is dead.

        restraining the movement of the Immaculate is cast aside.
        In the case of artifacts and naturally occurring phenomena,
        their effects are suspended for a number of turns equal
        to the Exalted's Martial Arts score.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Bodies of water absorb force directed against them,
        dissipating damage. With the execution of a few fluid body
        movements, the Immaculate invoking the Water Dragon
        Form becomes more like the watery element she serves.&lt;br&gt;
        For the remainder of the scene after successful invocation
        of the Water Dragon Form, the martial artist gets a
        bonus to her lethal and bashing soaks equal to her Martial
        Arts Ability and can soak lethal damage with her Stamina
        for the duration of the Charm. In addition, whenever
        successfully attacked, the Exalt may spend additional
        Essence points for extra soak on a 1 mote per 2 points of
        soak basis. The character may declare how much Essence
        she is spending after her normal soak has been applied but
        before the attacker's player rolls damage.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition, the character's fluid form makes her
        blows harder to evade. Mechanically, this Charm increases
        her Martial Arts by an amount equal to her
        permanent Essence for the duration of the Charm. This is
        a Charm enhancement and counts against the maximum
        amount the Dragon-Blood may increase her Martial Arts
        by with Charms.&lt;br&gt;
        Invoking the form also requires a successful Dexterity
        + Martial Arts check, representing the basic execution of
        the move itself. If the roll fails, the Charm does not
        activate, and the motes spent to power it are not expended,
        but the character's action is wasted.&lt;br&gt;
        Only one Form-type Charm can be invoked at any
        one time. Invoking a new Form-type Charm automatically
        ends the effects of any currently active Form-type Charm.

        Immaculate steals 3 motes of Essence from the target and
        adds them to his own reserves. This target's lost Essence
        is recovered normally.&lt;br&gt;
        This stolen Essence can be used by the character —
        but only on other Water Dragon Path Charms. Essence
        stolen in this manner fades from the Immaculate at a rate
        of 1 mote per minute.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By executing a few special katas, the Immaculate
        invoking the Ghost-Restraining Whirlpool Stance sets up
        a vortex of water Essence capable of immobilizing even
        very powerful spirits.&lt;br&gt;
        To make an attack to set up a Ghost-Restraining
        Whirlpool, the martial artist spends her turn executing the
        movements necessary to start the Charm. The player
        should roll the Immaculate's Dexterity + Martial Arts.
        The player of any spirit in the area of effect should
        reflexively roll Essence in an opposed contest against the
        Immaculate. If the spirit wins, the whirlpool has no effect.
        For every success the Dynast gets, all spirits in the area of
        effect must add a + 1 difficulty penalty to any actions they
        take, as the roiling whirlpool of Essence draws them in.&lt;br&gt;
        If the difficulty penalty ever exceeds a spirit's permanent
        Essence rating, the spirit is totally immobilized,
        unless its permanent Essence rating is higher than the
        Immaculate's. In that case, it still suffers the difficulty
        penalties but, otherwise, acts as normal. The Ghost-Restraining
        Whirlpool has a radius of (10 x the character's
        Essence) in yards. While sustaining the whirlpool, the
        character must add +2 to the difficulty of any tasks she
        attempts, to reflect the enforced formality of her move-
        ment, and cannot move out of the area of effect without
        dropping the Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        If the Dragon-Blood hits his target, for a fraction of
        a second, every moving fluid in the target's body reverses
        itself. Needless to say, living creatures do not
        react well to this.&lt;br&gt;
        The character makes an unarmed martial arts attack,
        which does normal damage. The target's player should roll
        her character's Stamina + Resistance against the
        Immaculate's original attack roll to hit, unreduced by
        attempts to dodge or parry it.&lt;br&gt;
        If the target does not exceed the Dragon-Blood's
        successes, the effects vary. Normal mortals and animals of
        less than twice the Immaculate's size failing the Resistance
        roll are killed outright. Exalted and other magical
        beings take a single automatic level of unsoakable lethal
        damage. Aquatic or amphibious creatures take two levels
        of damage. Even if a target's player succeeds at the
        Resistance roll, she must subtract two dice from any
        action involving physical activity for the Immaculate's
        Martial Arts in turns.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm only works against living corporeal beings.
        Spirit, magical constructs and other non-living (or
        unliving) beings are unaffected.

        The ocean pounds the shores with savage fury, and
        Water-aspected Immaculates can channel that fury. Upon
        making a successful martial arts attack, the Dragon-Blood
        may invoke this Charm and immediately make another
        attack, at -1 die to her pool. If that attack is successful, the
        Immaculate may make a further attack, but the penalty to
        her dice pool doubles to -2, on the third to -4, and so on.
        Each additional attack doubles the penalty yet again. If the
        penalties reduce an Immaculate's dice pool to zero, she
        may not make any further attacks. The maximum number
        of attacks a Dragon-Blood may make in this manner is
        equal to her Martial Arts rating.

        All other damage the Immaculate suffers for the rest of the
        turn is negated, drawn down into the bottomless abyss of
        the Water Dragon. This Charm may be used reflexively in
        response to being attacked, but it must be invoked before
        the damage for the attack is rolled.&lt;br&gt;
        Most walkers on the Water Dragon Path save this
        Charm for very extreme circumstances. The benefits can
        be high, but so are the consequences.

        The dark, smothering Essence of the Water Dragon
        can be channeled through a Dynast's blows to douse the
        metaphorical fire of an opponent's magic.&lt;br&gt;
        To invoke this Charm, the Exalted makes a normal
        martial arts attack, either armed or unarmed. The attack
        does normal damage, and if the target is actually
        hurt by the attack (that is, loses health levels), the
        martial artist's player should make an immediate reflexive
        Martial Arts + Essence roll with a difficulty equal to
        the target's Essence. For a number of turns equal to the
        successes that the Immaculate gets, all Charms and
        sorcery affecting the target are suppressed. If the num-
        ber of successes exceeds the Essence of the character
        who invoked an affected Charm or cast an affected
        spell, the magic is actually dispelled.&lt;br&gt;
        Characters affected can renew Charms on themselves
        during the duration of the suppression. Unless the Charms
        are specifically noted as having cumulative benefits, characters
        who suddenly have the same Charm active on them
        twice when the suppression ends gain no special benefits,
        and even cumulative Charms cannot exceed their normal
        maximum effectiveness.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm can be used on friendly targets, but the
        martial artist must do at least one health level of bashing
        damage to trigger the effect.

        The Tsunami Force Shout radiates out from the
        Immaculate in a 45-degree arc, reaching out to her Essence
        in yards. Anyone, friend or foe, caught in the area of effect
        takes twice the Dynast's Martial Arts + Essence as damage,
        as a wave of Water Essence washes over them.&lt;br&gt;
        The type of damage varies, depending on the characters'
        strength of spirit. The players of everyone caught
        in the area of effect must make a reflexive Essence check.
        If the roll botches, the damage is aggravated and automatic
        - everything not soaked translates into an
        automatic health level of aggravated damage. If the roll
        fails, the damage is aggravated but rolled normally. If the
        roll succeeds, the damage is lethal and rolled normally.
        With at least three successes on the Essence roll, the
        damage is bashing.

        By invoking the Eyes of the Wood Dragon, an Immaculate
        can perceive the patterns of a victim's soul and
        easily find the place to strike to cause the most damage.&lt;br&gt;
        When the Exalt next makes a martial arts attack that
        succeeds, roll her Essence rating as extra damage dice. This
        damage is delivered after the damage from the attack itself
        has been soaked. This damage ignores any armor, magical
        or otherwise, but may be soaked normally. If, for some
        reason (for example, the effects of the spell Invulnerable
        Skin of Bronze), the attack does not roll dice of damage,
        the extra dice of damage are not applied.&lt;br&gt;
        This attack may also affect dematerialized spirits as if
        materialized. This Charm is only effective against living
        beings and spirits — constructs and automata are immune
        to its effects. A character cannot invoke the effects of more
        than one instance of this Charm on a single attack.

        rest of the turn, the Immaculate's bashing soak is boosted
        by her Martial Arts rating, and she may soak lethal damage
        with her normal bashing soak.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 3 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Minimum Martial Arts&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Wood Dragon Vitality&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        To use this Charm, a Wood Dragon Immaculate need
        merely caress her opponent, which results in a sharp pain
        in the target's head and no other obvious effects. If done in
        combat, this caress must be part of a successful attack.&lt;br&gt;
        For the remainder of the scene in which the Soul
        Mark is placed, any attacks the Immaculate makes against
        the Soul-Marked target have an automatic success added
        to the attack roll before the target's player makes her
        defense roll. Multiple soul marks are cumulative.&lt;br&gt;
        Soul Marking is especially painful to spirits — as
        painful as a real brand is to mortals. In addition to the
        effects listed above, each Soul Mark reduces a spirit's dice
        pools by -1 for the remainder of the scene, representing the
        constant burning pain the being endures.&lt;br&gt;
        For 24 hours following the use of this Charm, an
        Immaculate can sense when a being she has Soul Marked
        is within her Essence in yards, and which being it is.

        Prerequisite Charms: Soul-Marking Strike&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Invoking the Wood Dragon Form puts the Immaculate
        in deeper touch with his own life force and healing
        ability. The martial artist strikes his own body with a series
        of precise, quick blows, which activate certain pressure
        points and strengthen the flow of Essence through the
        character's mortal shell.&lt;br&gt;
        For the remainder of the scene after successful invocation
        of the Wood Dragon Form, the Immaculate
        regenerates one health level of bashing damage per turn
        and one health level of lethal damage every two turns until
        killed. These health levels return at the beginning of each
        turn. Health levels lost to aggravated damage cannot be
        regenerated in this manner.&lt;br&gt;
        Invoking the form also requires a successful Dexterity
        + Martial Arts roll, representing the basic execution of the
        move itself. If the roll fails, the motes for this Charm are
        not spent, but the action is wasted.&lt;br&gt;
        Only one Form-type Charm can be invoked at any
        one time. Invoking a new Form-type Charm automatically
        ends the effects of any currently active Form-type Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        By executing a sinuous series of moves and undulations
        of the body, a Wood-aspected Immaculate can
        fascinate and distract opponents. Those characters affected
        by the Charm are transfixed by the hypnotic
        movements, standing rooted to the spot.&lt;br&gt;
        As long as the Exalt maintains the series of moves, the
        player of anyone wishing to take any action other than to
        stare in rapt fascination must win a reflexive opposed
        check between her character's Wits and the Immaculate's
        Martial Arts + Charisma. While executing the Unbreakable
        Fascination Kata, the Exalt may speak, move at half
        pace and dodge. Anything else, including an attack, breaks
        the Charm. Many Wood Dragons use this technique to
        draw close to an opponent before attacking.

        &lt;br&gt;
        The Dynast wishing to make an Enthralling Blow
        Attack must succeed in a normal martial arts attack
        against his target. Instead of rolling damage, the
        Immaculate's player and the target's both immediately
        make a reflexive opposed roll pitting the martial artist's
        Essence + Martial Arts against the victim's Essence +
        Willpower. If the Immaculate beats the target in the roll,
        the target is enthralled. She loses any action for the rest of
        the turn, and may take no actions at all other than to stand
        there, slack-jawed and vacant-eyed. On each subsequent
        turn the victim may attempt to shake off the effects of the
        Enthralling Blow Attack, her player rolling the character's
        Essence + Willpower, with a difficulty of 1 + the number of
        successes that the Immaculate got on the opposed roll.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm only works on living creatures.

        &lt;br&gt;
        When striking a spirit, the Wood Dragon Immaculate's
        knowledge of spirit energy allows her to channel her own
        Essence into the spirit's form, disrupting it temporarily.&lt;br&gt;
        The Immaculate must make a successful martial arts
        attack, either bare handed or with a weapon. This attack
        affects spirits as if they were materialized and does normal
        damage. If the Dynast actually wounds the spirit, her
        player immediately makes a reflexive Essence + Martial
        Arts roll with a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence
        rating. For every success that the martial artist gets on the
        roll, the spirit must subtract one die from all its dice pools.
        This penalty fades at the rate of one die per turn.

        Spirit-Rending Technique&lt;br&gt;

        Minimum Martial Arts: 5&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Spirit-Wracking Method&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Much like Spirit-Wracking Method, Spirit-Rending
        Technique allows an Immaculate to strike a spirit being.
        But the effects are far more deadly than simple disruption.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist makes a normal martial arts attack,
        whether armed or unarmed. If she hits, instead of
        doing normal damage, make a reflexive Essence + Willpower
        roll. If the number of successes equals or exceeds
        the spirit's permanent Essence, it takes one automatic
        health level of aggravated damage. If the number of
        successes exceeds multiples of the spirit's Essence, then
        the spirit will take multiple health levels of damage. If the
        roll does not equal the spirit's Essence, the Spirit-Rending
        Technique has no effect.&lt;br&gt;
        For Example: Tiphanie chooses to make an example of
        her fight with Talia, a weak nature spirit. She strikes Talia,
        and her player rolls eight successes on the Essence + Willpower
        roll. Talia is a weak spirit, and her permanent
        Essence is 3. She thus takes two automatic unsoakable levels
        of aggravated damage from the attack because the result is
        more than twice Talia's Essence. The extra two successes
        are wasted. If Tiphanie's player had rolled nine successes,
        Talia would have taken three levels of aggravated damage.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower + 1 mote per attack dodged&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Martial Arts: 5&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Wood Dragon Form&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Once a Wood Dragon Immaculate is truly attuned to
        the patterns of soul energy, she can perceive the patterns
        of death as well — at least those directed against her person
        by other beings.&lt;br&gt;
        For the remainder of the scene after invoking the
        Death-Pattern Sensing Attitude, the Immaculate may
        make a full dodge against any hand-to-hand attack
        launched at her in a turn by a living being — or a being
        animated by spiritual energy. This includes spirits and
        the undead. This full dodge can even be used against
        ranged attacks, so long as the attacker is within the
        Immaculate's Essence in yards. Each dodge roll costs the
        Immaculate a single mote. The maximum number of
        attacks that can be dodged in this manner per turn is
        equal to the Immaculate's Essence. This dodge does not
        cost the Exalted her action for the turn and may even be
        made after she has acted in a turn.&lt;br&gt;
        The Dynast does not have to be aware of the attack,
        but the Patterns of Death do not alert an Immaculate to the
        mere presence of other living beings, only of their attacks.
        This Charm is ineffective against traps, attacks from automata
        and ranged attacks that occur from outside the
        radius of the Death-Pattern Sensing Attitude.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This technique heals the wounds of others — but the
        Wood-aspected Immaculate cannot dissipate another's
        injuries directly as he can his own. He must first take these
        injuries onto his own body. All the Immaculate needs to do
        to activate this Charm is to touch the target. For every 3
        motes of Essence the character invests in the Charm, he
        can draw one health level of damage out of a target and
        into himself. Even the most grievous wounds on the target
        close and heal, while the same injuries immediately appear
        on the Immaculate's body.&lt;br&gt;
        Taking on the wounds of others can be quite painful
        and dangerous. The character immediately assumes
        the proper level of impairment, although he can heal
        this damage with the Wood Dragon Form, assuming it
        is not aggravated.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is the highest mystery of the Dragon of
        Wood. Few have seen this Charm executed - and even
        fewer who have seen it have lived to tell anyone about it.
        The close alignment of the Wood Dragon with the forces
        of life allows the most highly skilled of its disciples mastery
        over life and death itself.&lt;br&gt;
        Invoking this Charm is an action in and of itself, and
        it absorbs the character's dice action for the turn. After the
        character invokes this Charm, it lingers on his hands as a
        sizzling green-and-black aura. In order to discharge the
        aura, the Immaculate must make a successful attack, though
        touching an unsuspecting victim would also work. If discharged
        by an attack, the attack does normal damage in
        addition to the effects of Soul Mastery.&lt;br&gt;
        The martial artist's player rolls a reflexive contested
        roll of his character's Essence + Martial Arts against his
        opponent's Stamina + Endurance. If the target loses this
        contest, her soul is severed from her body, killing her
        instantly. Even if she ties or beats the martial artist, the
        shock to the soul is considerable, and the character takes
        a number of dice of aggravated damage equal to the
        Immaculate's Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        In addition to its effects on living beings, any spirit
        with an Essence equal to or lower than the Immaculate's
        that is struck by Soul Mastery is annihilated utterly, ripped
        asunder by the Immaculate's wrath and permanently destroyed.
        Spirits can sense the presence of Exalted schooled
        in Soul Mastery and fear and dislike them intensely.&lt;br&gt;
        Using Soul Mastery is a not easy on the Immaculate.
        In addition to its considerable cost, once invoked, the
        power must be used — and quickly, lest the powerful
        Essence shred the martial artist's own soul. The Immaculate
        has her Essence in turns to successfully unleash the
        Charm, or she must resist the effects herself!
