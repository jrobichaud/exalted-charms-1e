        In taking those actions she considers necessary,
        whatever the personal cost, a Sidereal sets her order on
        the world. As she does so, it helplessly yields its Essence
        to her. This Charm draws on the Exalt's ability to play
        spirits and the world, manipulating Creation in Creation's
        service. Immediately after a successful roll using Conviction
        or immediately after a Socialize roll that substantially
        changed the local social environment in her favor, the
        Exalt regains twice her Conviction in motes of Essence,
        up to her normal maximum. There is no cost to use this
        Charm's effects - learning this Charm simply enhances
        the Exalt's capabilities.

        The character blots the target's name from the rolls
        of those destined to attract love. The target has an
        effective Appearance 1 for all non-magical effects. To
        invoke any form of supernatural appeal or to maintain it
        into a new scene, the target must spend a Willpower
        point, and his player must succeed at a Manipulation +
        Socialize roll against a difficulty of the Sidereal's Essence.
        He makes this roll after paying for the Charm or
        Ability used. If anyone with permanent Essence less than
        the Sidereal's own has romantic feelings for the target,
        those feelings are instantly severed. They do not return
        when the Charm ends.

        Quickly sketching a proposed relationship in the
        plans for future fate, the character increases the power
        one person has over another. The character names the
        fashion in which the beneficiary acquires dominion over
        the target â€” generally fear or desire, sexual or otherwise.
        The player rolls Manipulation + Socialize. To resist
        being intimidated, enthralled or impressed to the point
        of near-servitude, the target must spend one temporary
        Willpower per scene where he encounters the Charm's
        beneficiary. When he has spent Willpower equal to the
        number of successes rolled, the compulsion fades. Normally,
        the emotional impact does not entirely dissipate
        so much as mute itself to non-magical levels. The Sidereal
        can choose herself as the beneficiary. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Conviction with this Charm.

        As with legal crimes, the right tricks can make social
        crimes... disappear. The Sidereal can instantly erase the
        onus attached to herself or to someone else for some
        social blunder or taboo violation. Her player rolls Manipulation
        + Socialize. A single success makes people
        stop caring. With three successes, the character can
        choose instead either to make the relevant action generally
        acceptable or to make the person who committed it
        an admirable rebel (e.g., an ideologue who makes a bold,
        daring statement by digging up people's dead grandmothers,
        however disgusting that behavior would be in
        others). The Charm only affects communities where the
        relevant action significantly contributes to the target's
        notoriety. (To make theft socially acceptable through-
        out Creation, the Sidereal would have to arrange an act
        of theft infamous throughout Creation.) Socially acceptable
        acts often retain legal penalties. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Temperance with this Charm.

        The character wraps himself in the tenor of fate that
        gives rise to lust. He becomes impossible to recognize.
        Looking upon him, others perceive only a blazing sense
        that he is their greatest possession and that to harm or
        disappoint him is to risk losing their own hearts. For
        those actively hostile to him, it requires a Conviction
        roll to attack. For others, it requires a Temperance roll
        not to act as best they can, short of suicide, to please him.
        This Charm adds the character's Essence in automatic
        successes to any seduction roll.

        This Charm uses two prayer strips marked with the
        scripture of the Whore. The character holds them up,
        one at a time, and names a target for each. The targets
        must be within 10 miles. Each prayer strip burns lambent
        blue for a moment before disappearing, reappearing
        wrapped around one of its target's bones. Its light cannot
        shine through even the thinnest veil of flesh, but bursts
        forth brilliantly if that flesh is ever cut away. Extracting
        the strip requires 12 successes on an extended Dexterity
        + Medicine roll. Each attempt inflicts one level of
        unsoakable lethal damage.<br>
        The Sidereal's player rolls Manipulation + Socialize
        against the Essence of each target. If he succeeds both
        times, the character can dictate a new social and emo-
        tional relationship between the two targets. As fast and
        hard as plausible, for the duration of the Charm, events
        push the victims toward that social relationship. The
        imposed emotional relationship is partly a magical com-
        pulsion, which remains while the character commits
        Essence to the Charm. Under its influence, a target must
        spend a Willpower point to act significantly at odds with
        the imposed emotional context. The Charm also in-
        stantly creates genuine emotions, which do not depend
        on magic to sustain them. They fade or blossom as
        emotions normally do.<br>
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.
