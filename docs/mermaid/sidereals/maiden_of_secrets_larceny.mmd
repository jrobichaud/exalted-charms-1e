        The character calls the weave of events to her. Thin
        tendrils of fate snake out from Creation to twine around
        each of her fingers, fading into phosphorescent green
        visibility for the final meter of their journey. If the
        character is in or ventures into the Wyld, she becomes a
        small island of stability and Creation, her destiny snuck
        into the abode of chance by craft, art and cunning.
        Neither the character nor anything within 10 yards of
        her suffers the touch of the Wyld.

        Again, the character summons the weave of events,
        but now, she crosses her wrists and deftly switches
        threads from one hand to the other as they materialize.
        If her player succeeds at a Wits + Larceny roll, the Exalt
        steals a portion of her target's destiny and can borrow up
        to her Essence in bashing and lethal soak, in damage dice
        or in dice from a specific pool (such as Dexterity +
        Melee). The target loses the use of that soak or those dice
        for the remainder of the scene. The character gains it.
        The Sidereal cannot borrow more soak or more dice than
        the target possesses. This Charm is partially cumulative:
        The Sidereal can filch many different things in one scene
        but cannot add to the same pool or soak twice. When a
        Sidereal borrows dice for a pool, this is a dice bonus
        added by a Charm and should be considered as such
        when determining the maximum effect of other dice-
        bonus Charms.

        With a twist and a tug, the Sidereal steals another
        being's name. The Sidereal learns the victim's true
        name, and for the duration of the Charm, none save the
        Exalt can speak or think it. Make a reflexive Dexterity +
        Larceny roll with difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence
        for Fair Folk to notice and substitute another name
        for their own before the Sidereal completes the theft.

        Bumping casually into his target or otherwise making
        physical contact, and after a successful Wits + Larceny
        roll with difficulty equal to the target's Essence, the
        character pockets his victim's dreams. Fair Folk suffer
        the character's Essence in dice of aggravated damage,
        ignoring armor, as the character dexterously unweaves
        some of the dream Essence from their Wyld nature. They
        immediately become ravenous and slightly mad, though
        sane enough to Dodge further attempts by the character
        to touch them. Any other characters affected by this
        Charm become listless: Until the Sidereal stops committing
        Essence to this Charm and thereby releases their
        dreams, they cannot regain Willpower and do not regenerate
        Essence naturally. Sidereal Exalted may always use
        their Temperance with this Charm.

        Glittering green sparks weave about the character
        for a moment before settling into her hair and skin and
        becoming all but invisible. To the eyes of any criminal,
        the character seems to have the virtues and qualities that
        best qualify her for respect and admiration. The Sidereal
        can reduce the target number of all peaceful or defensive
        interactions with rogues, scum and knaves.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Savory Maiden. The Sidereal holds it up
        before him, whereupon it straightens and affixes itself to
        reality as if nailed to the air, occasionally emitting an
        effulgence of green light. The Sidereal then names his
        victim, who must be within 10 miles. For a moment, the
        victim sees the prayer strip through the Exalt's eyes,
        burning a brilliant green. Ancient forces set in motion by
        the Charm wheel and deal with the Wyld, trading the
        victim's destiny to chaos in exchange for a portion of
        chaos claimed into Creation.<br>
        The Sidereal's player rolls Manipulation + Larceny.
        Each success represents one month of this curse, and in
        each month, the Wyld's efforts intensify — they're not
        organized, conscious or directed, as a whole, but they're,
        nevertheless, malevolent. The Charm draws Fair Folk
        and Wyld-spawned monsters to the target, their schemes
        and determination deadlier as time goes on. The victim
        suffers a derangement (see Exalted, p. 281) or a taint (see
        Exalted: The Lunars, pp. 219-221) as the order and laws
        that bind her deteriorate, though she may overcome this
        for a scene with a successful Temperance roll. However,
        when the curse expires, or when the Wyld has claimed its
        due, something in the chaos understands that the Maid-
        ens have cheated it — that it has given more territory to
        order and reason than chaos has consumed. The Sidereal's
        name is marked. The more often he uses this Charm, the
        more likely he is to find himself hunted by the very forces
        he invokes.<br>
        The player of a victim of this Charm can make an
        extended Intelligence + Lore roll every month for her
        character to understand the nature of the curse. With six
        successes, she understands that the prayer strip was
        within 10 miles of her location at the time the curse fell
        and that its destruction can free her. Twelve successes
        gives her its precise location.
