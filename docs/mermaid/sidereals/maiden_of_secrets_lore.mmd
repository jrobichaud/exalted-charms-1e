        Systematic Understanding of Everything<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote<br>

        The character sleeps, and the Maiden of Secrets grants
        her a vision of the projected plan for fate, from the moment
        of her waking until the end of Creation. A character
        trained to use this Charm can filter her perceptions and
        observe a small portion of the Loom of Fate, integrating it
        with her own extensive knowledge. Until the vision fades
        with her next dream, she adds a + 1 specialty of her choice,
        which applies to all relevant Abilities.<br>
        Characters can only spend Essence for this Charm
        while asleep. This can increase the specialty total for an
        Ability above +3, but the character cannot add more
        than three specialty dice to any given roll. These specialties
        are dice bonuses added by a Charm and should be
        considered as such when determining the maximum
        effect of other dice-bonus Charms.

        to one Ability and a + 1 bonus to all Abilities where it is
        relevant. Characters can only spend Essence for this
        Charm while asleep and cannot invoke it in the same
        slumber as Systematic Understanding of Everything.

        Scuttling on the paths of fate are the seven Heptarchs
        of Tragedy, gods of those truths and futures displeasing to
        mortal eyes. Catching sight of a horror to come, they
        snatch up the knowledge of it and bind it in a living
        sepulcher that they cast into the earth. Gathering together
        for three hours and simultaneously invoking this
        Charm, a trinity of Exalted serving Serenity, Battles and
        Secrets can dredge such a sepulcher forth and witness an
        atrocity not yet come to pass. At any time within the next
        year, the player of each can make a single Lore roll as if
        the Sidereal were looking backward from the end of the
        Age of Sorrows. For example, having lost an important
        artifact, the character can roll to remember notable
        events wherein it is destined to appear. Five successes
        may lead him to it immediately, while one success may
        indicate only that the Maidens intend it to fall into the
        hands of a young Lunar hero &quot;eventually.&quot; Extrapolating
        another aspect of the weave from a glimpse of one horrific
        section of the Loom is difficult, even for the Exalted.<br>
        Characters can use this Charm, at most, once per
        month. Multiple uses are not cumulative. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Conviction with this Charm.

        Charting the paths of the future can help to resolve
        even the stickiest of situations. Gathering together for
        three hours and simultaneously invoking this Charm, a
        trinity of Exalted serving Journeys, Serenity and Endings
        map the paths of destiny and learn at least one method
        by which they may achieve a given goal. From a mechanical
        perspective, they learn the price of success at
        some endeavor â€” anything from &quot;a few bumps and
        bruises&quot; to &quot;the destruction of your Circle and every-
        thing you believe in.&quot; If the Sidereal characters choose to
        pay the price, they automatically achieve their goal;
        both the price and their victory occur in a narrative
        fashion in amongst other stories.<br>
        The paths lain out by these small prophecies are
        rarely optimal. Characters may reasonably decide to pur-
        sue the goals in their own fashion rather than following
        the prophecy (paying the price) or dropping the matter.
        The Storyteller should only slightly inflate the price for
        resolving a peripheral matter but set a prohibitive price
        for automatically resolving something central to the story.
        The characters still benefit, however, even when the
        price they pay is greater than what their own planning
        might provide. They are assured of success and can focus
        their attention and planning effort on other matters.

        The Sidereal weaves one of the nets of Neferuaten,
        made from filaments of destiny thinner than the distance
        between a stone and its shadow or a dog and its howl.
        These nets can catch and cling even to those things
        normally immune to the workings of destiny: not strong
        enough to impede a Primordial's course, but cunning
        enough to adhere to the nonexistent borders of Cecelyne,
        the Endless Desert, or hang like gossamer from a
        Deathlord's flesh. The Exalt can cast the net around any
        creature she can see. Success requires a Dexterity + Lore
        roll with difficulty equal to the target's Essence. After-
        ward, the net then exerts a slow, continual pull on the
        world around the target. In a circumstance the Sidereal
        names, all dice pools that oppose the target have their
        target number reduced by 1, to a minimum of 4. The net
        lasts a year and a day. Instead of rolling the attack, the
        Sidereal can spend a permanent Willpower to guarantee
        success. This also ensures that the net lasts long enough
        to fulfill her purpose in casting it, even if one must
        reckon that time in years. Multiple such nets may cover
        a single target. Sidereal Exalted may always use their
        Valor with this Charm.

        Hissing a long susurration, the character illumines
        an elemental or spirit of the earth in a verdant glow and
        bestows upon it a secret: a truth about the long course of
        the world that the spirit can never speak. The spirit must
        perform one favor for the Exalted in return, chosen by
        necessity and not by desire. Neither the character nor
        the spirit chooses what the favor might be. The spirit
        automatically knows the favor's nature, but the Exalted
        does not. Until the favor is paid, success at a Wits +
        Temperance roll with difficulty 3 is required for the spirit
        to initiate hostile action against the Exalt. (It can still
        reply to violence with violence.)

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden in Terror, which glows a sickly
        green as it curls and twists and sinks into the Sidereal's
        palm. It leaves behind a faint tracery of symbols in the
        tongue of the Old Realm.<br>
        When the Sidereal so chooses, he shows his palm to
        a target and names that victim's fate: which of the
        target's worst fears the world will realize, and how. The
        Exalt's player then rolls Intelligence + Lore. The target
        instantly loses the Sidereal's Essence plus the number of
        successes in temporary Willpower, to a minimum of 0,
        and twice that amount in motes of Essence.<br>
        Under normal circumstances, although the character
        simply states what is preordained, the player chooses
        and names a fate and manner for its realization that he
        finds dramatically interesting. At the moment the character
        speaks, that event is destined. The Storyteller
        should suggest an alternative if that destiny simply
        cannot come to pass. Game events can alter this destiny
        and rescue the target, due to changes in departmental
        vision and the meddling of Primordials, but the target
        herself cannot avoid her doom.
