        Generalized Ammunition Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>

        The mirror of adjusting circumstances to meet one's
        needs is adapting one's needs to things found in one's
        circumstances. Both allow for the smooth progress of
        fate. This Charm lets an adaptable Exalt fire anything no
        heavier than her fist and no longer than her arm as if it
        were an arrow, including handfuls of dust or fire, shouts,
        dragonflies, small spirits or shadows. Living things can
        avoid the Sidereal seizing and launching them with a
        reflexive Dexterity + Dodge roll against a difficulty equal
        to the Sidereal's Archery score. Upon impact, an improvised
        arrow inflicts damage as a normal arrow of any type
        (Exalt's choice), in addition to any unusual effects appropriate
        to the attack. Sidereal Exalted can only shape
        arrows from concrete things, although the Maiden of
        Battles shapes her arrows from intention and desire.

        Graced by the chance to serve those who weave fate,
        an arrow gleefully weaves in the air to strike its opponent
        from an unexpected direction. The Exalt adds up to her
        Essence in dice to an Archery roll. In addition, the arrow
        takes no penalties from up to 50 percent cover.

        <br>
        The character fires a number of arrows no
        greater than her Essence, which first scatter and
        then strike a single target from every side. Use one
        attack roll for all the arrows, but apply the damage
        for each of them separately.

        Spotting an opportunity thanks to the graces of fate,
        the character launches an arrow before her normal
        initiative. This Charm lets her automatically win initiative
        over a single target for purposes of making an
        Archery attack against him. She cannot split her dice
        pool on the turn she uses Opportune Shot. Characters
        using Opportune Shot, Thunderclap Rush Attack or
        similar abilities in competition roll for initiative with
        one another normally.

        If skill does not suffice to make her shot, then a
        character may trust to the world's esteem for her. If not
        to that, then to the world's fear of what she hopes to save
        it from. If not to that, to the world's dreams of the glories
        she strives for. Even if these things fail, she may trust to
        luck. This is the Five Seasons Approach. The character
        can reduce the target number of an Archery roll. Sidereal
        Exalted can always use any Virtue with this Charm.

        Many Missiles Bow Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Archery: 5<br>

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Clay Maiden. The Exalt casts it into the
        sky, where it radiates a gaudy pink light, hovering 10
        yards above her bow.<br>
        For the duration of this Charm, the character's
        arrows have triple their normal range. In addition, for 1
        experience point each, the Sidereal can learn transformations
        to apply to an arrow as it falls, reshaping it into
        some other aspect of Creation. Commonly known trans-
        formations include:<br>
        • Rain of fire: The arrow turns into a rain of fire,
        attacking and applying its normal damage to all creatures
        within five yards of the target, setting flammable things
        alight, and ignoring armor on a successful hit.<br>
        • Snow: It begins to snow around the region where
        the arrow fell. The character must renew this effect with
        at least one arrow per minute to maintain it.<br>
        • Life: The target is healed for one level of lethal or
        bashing damage.<br>
        • Grain: A small patch of ripe wheat, enough to
        feed one person for a day, sprouts where the arrow lands.
        • Boulder: The arrow turns into an unblockable
        boulder as it falls. It can be dodged. Double the raw
        damage of the attack, including extra successes, when
        used against inanimate objects.<br>
        • Glass: The arrow becomes transparent as it falls.
        Targets must make a reflexive Perception + Awareness
        roll at difficulty 2 to defend against it without the use
        of Charms.<br>
        Each such arrow costs 1 mote of Essence to fire.
        Living or heavily worked &quot;arrows&quot; based on the Generalized
        Ammunition Technique cannot suffer
        transformations, nor can arrows made from the Five
        Magical Materials.<br>
        Characters can learn transformations from other
        Exalted with this Charm. They can also design new
        transformations, with the Storyteller's approval. Effects
        should be simple and should not directly duplicate the
        effects of other Charms.
