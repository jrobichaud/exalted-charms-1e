        Becoming the Wilderness<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote per target number reduction<br>
        Duration: One day<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Minimum Essence: 2<br>

        <br>
        The character calls forth and spreads cat's cradle
        between her hands as a representation of the weave of
        fate for the entire local wilderness. She sets her will on
        it, remaking the land into a mirror of her soul. For the
        duration of this Charm, tree branches shelter her from
        the rain, food animals wander into her camp, the winds
        blow lightly near her, and she rarely encounters danger.
        This Charm reduces the target number of Survival or
        Awareness checks in the wilderness. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Valor with this Charm.

        In turn, the character can make his soul mirror the land,
        imposing the pattern of its fate upon the flows of his Essence.
        His player receives automatic successes equal to the Sidereal's
        Essence in any roll against a natural beast. While this Charm
        is active, add the Sidereal's Essence in extra dice when
        dealing socially with Lunar Exalted. Sidereal Exalted may
        always use their Compassion with this Charm.

        Dreaming the Wild Lands<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes, 2 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Five days<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Minimum Essence: 3<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Adopting the Untamed Face<br>
        <br>
        As she mirrors herself to the land, the character
        bends the wild directly to her will. Under the pressure of
        her intention, trees shift their places and river dragons
        cease to hunger. She can make cosmetic changes to the
        scenery in uncivilized regions and dictate the behavior of
        any wild beast she can see. She receives all the benefits
        of Adopting the Untamed Face. Unless they know
        better, Lunar Exalted perceive her as an eminent mem-
        ber of their own kind â€” that is, ikth-ya, as described on
        page 112 of Exalted: the Lunars. Sidereal characters
        with Essence 5 or more appear as murr-ya.<br>
        Lunars do not imagine a Tell or Caste Mark or other
        such indicators. The Sidereal Exalted simply carries
        herself like an ikth-ya and, therefore, must be a Lunar.<br>
        Even if a Lunar knows better, the impression is difficult
        to shake. Mistreating the character is mechanically easy
        but emotionally difficult. Sidereal Exalted may always
        use their Valor with this Charm.

        Sky and Rain Mantra<br>

        The character extends her influence into the sky,
        adjusting the region's weather. Her player rolls Stamina +
        Survival. The number of successes determines how harsh
        the Exalt makes the weather. Specifically, other characters'
        players need at least that many successes on a Survival
        roll for their characters to survive the new conditions
        without hardship. The Sidereal can voluntarily reduce
        this difficulty when creating the storm. If the Exalt wishes
        to calm the weather, she needs only one success.
        Generally, this Charm takes effect within either
        minutes or hours, depending on the magnitude
        of the effects.

        Sky Spirit Demand<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Sky and Rain Mantra<br>
        <br>
        The character strives to mirror the fate of an air
        spirit or elemental to the flows of her own Essence, and
        vice versa. Her player rolls Manipulation + Survival
        against a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence. If she
        succeeds, the Exalt imposes one of her goals upon the
        spirit. It appreciates the importance of that goal to the
        same degree and in the same fashion the Sidereal does.
        It can choose between that goal and its other beliefs
        when and if they clash dramatically. Using this Charm in
        a civilized region or against a civilized spirit adds +2 to
        the difficulty. It can be adapted for use against spirits and
        elementals of other elements, but this also adds +2
        difficulty. Sidereal Exalted may always use their Compassion
        with this Charm.

        Wilderness-Commanding Practice<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Five days<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Survival: 5<br>

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden Entombed. The character casts
        it into the air, where it dances in the wind, casting off
        shapeless golden phantasms.<br>
        This Charm co-opts a wild region and turns it
        against the Exalt's enemies. So long as the character
        remains within sight of the prayer strip, he notices
        anyone of interest within his Essence in miles, even
        those who are not able to be tracked by non-supernatural
        trackers. He can give anyone three automatic successes
        on all Survival rolls made within the region or reduce
        anyone's Survival pool to 0 before they benefit from
        Charms. Each effect requires a further commitment of 2
        motes per person so affected.
        The Sidereal can also convey the location of someone
        or something to a local beast or spirit. The Charm's
        target sees the indicated person or thing as a hated
        enemy. This requires 5 motes and a successful Manipulation
        + Survival roll against the beast or spirit's Essence.
        The 5 motes are not committed. Intelligent victims can
        change their minds if given reason to rethink the
        situation. Sidereal Exalted may always use their Valor
        with this Charm.
