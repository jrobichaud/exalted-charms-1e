        Auspicious Prospects for (Caste)<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Investigation: 2<br>
        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        The Maidens grant many of their Chosen this gift,
        that keeps them clear-eyed and ever-alert for the patterns
        in the stars that inform them of the needs of destiny. This
        is actually five Charms, one for each Maiden.
        Auspicious Prospects for Journeys helps the character
        know when someone really ought to travel and,
        possibly, where. Auspicious Prospects for Serenity helps
        a character locate appropriate love matches or determine
        whom fate wishes to have joy. Auspicious Prospects
        for Battles hints at when and where and among whom a
        battle or war ought to take place. Auspicious Prospects
        for Fate — the Maiden of Secrets' Charm - gives
        insights into the proper overall direction of the world
        and the character's own life. Auspicious Prospects for
        Endings suggests when something might best pass from
        Creation. These Charms provide appropriate knowledge
        when the Storyteller so chooses.<br>
        This knowledge almost never gives a direct benefit
        to the character. More often, it provides her with goals
        to strive for! So, she must satisfy herself with the joy of
        service — and the ability to investigate the claims of
        other Sidereal Exalted, with a mote of Essence and a
        successful Intelligence + Investigation roll, when they
        assert that some fate or other is favorable or necessary.
        Any Sidereal can purchase any of these Charms. All
        five are favored for the Chosen of Secrets. The other
        Sidereal Exalted favor only their own caste's Charm.

        Marvelous Inclusion of Details<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote per success<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>

        When a character learns this Charm, she weaves a
        thread of aquamarine mystery into her eyes. From that
        moment forward, she and the essence of fate that makes
        for secrets are kin. The things of mystery and enigma
        wear a faint, joyous glamour in her eyes. Conversely,
        secrets go out of their way to provide the kinds of
        evidence the character likes best. This Charm adds up to
        the character's Essence in automatic successes to an
        Investigation roll. If possible, the character chooses
        what kind of evidence she finds - a murder weapon, a
        book shelved right next to her, notes stuffed in such a
        book, footprints or something of that ilk. Whatever she
        finds, she finds instantly. Sidereal Exalted may always
        use their Compassion with this Charm.

        Efficient Secretary Technique<br>

        Cost: 2 motes<br>

        On learning this Charm, the character spits out a
        jubilant construct of Essence in the shape of an small
        unmanifested emerald pattern spider. When so instructed
        by the invocation of this Charm, it races off along the
        weave of fate to locate some fact for the character — any
        available information neither generally lost nor actively
        concealed. Examples are the name of the local god-king
        or carpenter, how many years ago widow Esther lost her
        husband, the status of a given war, the number of oxen
        an old friend now owns, the temperature in Nexus and so
        forth. One turn later, it returns, whispering the information
        into the character's ear. The spirit is indestructible
        while the Exalt lives.

        Clapping his hands, the Sidereal causes a small
        plant to grow into the shape of a dedicated scholar and
        observer. This creature has the statistics and appearance
        of a typical mortal (see Exalted, pp. 276-277) except that
        it has an Intelligence 3, Awareness 3, Investigation 4,
        Lore 2 and Linguistics and languages equal to the
        character's own. It happily assists with research and
        investigation in any desired fashion, carrying books and
        research materials, noting details the character might
        miss, digging for truths in a large library and so forth.
        Under excessive stress, such as combat, it panics and
        reverts to the form of a plant; it can be coaxed back into
        human shape with a reapplication of this Charm.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of That Old Thing. The Sidereal forms a
        question or curiosity in her mind and plants the strip as
        if it were a seed. Over the course of the next day, it first
        develops roots and then sprouts into a tall mulberry tree.
        Local spirits of wood are drawn to visit it. They leave
        small gifts or secrets behind there. Five days later, the
        Sidereal can return. Her player rolls Charisma + Investigation.
        For each success, the Exalt finds both a piece of
        information useful in resolving her curiosity and a gift
        she will value beneath the tree. There are also various
        worthless offerings.<br>
        Returning earlier for faster answers is possible but
        may provoke the wrath of one or two wood spirits. The
        valuable gifts are generally trinkets that suit the character's
        tastes, but the Storyteller may include unique or important
        gifts for story reasons. Sidereal Exalted may always
        use their Compassion with this Charm.
