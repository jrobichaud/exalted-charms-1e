        The bodies of the Exalted are more durable than
        those of mere mortals. To help simulate this, an Exalt
        may buy extra health levels as if they were a Charm. A
        player may purchase this Charm up to once per dot of the
        Endurance Ability her character possesses. Each provides
        one -0 health level.

        The stars bathe the character in yellow stardust. It
        suffuses her, glittering beneath her skin, hair, clothing
        and eyes. She begins to run. She must keep her eyes
        focused straight forward, keep her course within 10
        degrees of its original heading and can take no other
        actions save walk, sprint, run, jump, ride, use a mobility-enhancing
        Charm or invoke the Lesser Sign of Mercury.
        Violating these strictures ends the Charm's effects. In
        exchange, for the duration of the Charm, the character
        receives an additional 5L/5B soak, needs no sleep, suffers
        no fatigue and adds her Essence to all Endurance rolls.
        Fatigue rolls do not need to be made for her wearing
        armor, regardless of environmental conditions. These
        benefits also apply to any horse she rides.<br>
        The character's journey is a thing of fate and not
        chance, interwoven with her reasons for traveling. If
        something renders her journey irrelevant or alters its
        appropriate destination, her player automatically makes
        a reflexive Perception + Awareness check for the Sidereal.
        Even on failure, she senses a change in the situation.
        Success gives her a hint of what it might be. Exalted who
        invoke this Charm while fleeing pursuit often know
        when it is safe to stop their flight.

        The character's world narrows to his journey. The
        strands of fate that bind him to things behind him
        loosen. This Charm includes all of the benefits of the
        Unswerving Juggernaut Principle. In addition, it grants
        an increased (10L/10B) soak bonus against attacks the
        character cannot see coming. He can dodge any attack
        reflexively with a dice pool of 0 and his permanent
        Essence in automatic successes. He can evade pursuit
        and cover his tracks without slowing down, deviating
        from his course or ending the Charm. This requires the
        normal Wits + Survival roll. This Charm does not defeat
        supernatural tracking such as Inevitable Pursuit. It ex-
        plicitly prevents trackers from noticing the straight-line
        travel the Forward-Thinking Technique enforces unless
        they succeed at the tracking contest.

        Prerequisite Charms: None
        Reflecting on the great sacrifices she might someday
        make for others, the character passes her hand over the
        weave of fate and imbues events with her own generosity
        of spirit. Weapons and other damage sources turn aside
        from her skin. She adds her permanent Essence to her
        lethal and bashing soak. This soak specifically applies
        even to aggravated damage sources. Creatures with Essence
        lower than her Compassion must spend one
        Willpower point each time they attempt to damage or
        disable her, or the attack automatically fails. This Charm
        is incompatible with the use of armor.

        The character's calm certainty in his own destiny
        turns aside a single event that might otherwise do him
        harm. Players of attackers with an Essence lower than the
        Sidereal's Temperance must succeed at a Willpower roll,
        or the attackers falter, and their attacks automatically
        fail. Even if they succeed, the character adds his permanent
        Essence to his lethal and bashing soak. This soak
        specifically applies even to aggravated damage sources.

        The character's chest convulses as she swallows her
        heart. This suspends the normal functioning of her body.
        The Exalt no longer suffers nor accumulates penalties
        from disease, poison, degenerative effects, hunger, thirst,
        fatigue, exhaustion, cold, heat, wounds or blood loss. She
        does not need to breathe. She emerges from this Charm
        in the exact physical state she entered it, save for any new
        wounds taken and any poisons or diseases she contracted
        while under the effect - which, effectively, enter her
        system at that point. While this Charm lasts, the Exalt
        ignores all accrued penalties from debilitating conditions
        and wounds and is unaware of their existence. Sufficient
        injury yields a nagging tactical distress that encourages
        her to withdraw from combat, but she otherwise cannot
        accept the notion that she is sick, poisoned, hungry, cold,
        wounded or otherwise impaired. She does not regain
        Essence except through the use of Charms. She functions
        normally when Incapacitated and cannot be knocked
        unconscious, but she can be killed by doing more than her
        Stamina health levels beyond Incapacitated.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the scripture
        of the Eternal Maiden. The character releases it into
        the air, where it darts and dances randomly about, staying
        within 100 yards of him, trailing vivid afterimages of yellow
        light. The character names a goal, which can be as grandiose
        or minor as he chooses, and geases himself to fulfill it.<br>
        A character under the influence of this Charm
        forsakes his name and his identity. Rolls to remember the
        character suffer a -3 die penalty (in addition to the
        normal penalty for remembering a Sidereal). The Exalt
        cannot focus on any goal save the one he named in the
        Charm. Irrelevant actions are forbidden. He suffers a
        three die penalty on all rolls that â€” while helping him
        toward his goal - have another primary purpose. How-
        ever, any non-aggravated injury or impairment the
        character receives while the Charm is active heals at the
        rate of one lethal health level or all bashing health levels
        per turn. Aggravated damage taken under the Charm's
        effects heals at one level per hour. The character heals
        preexisting conditions at the normal rate.<br>
        The character can end the Charm at any time but
        cannot reclaim his name and identity until he achieves his
        goal. If his goal becomes impossible to achieve, these things
        are forever lost. He cannot personally establish a new
        identity or name, and all attempts to do so fail, but high-
        ranking members of his division can issue replacements.
