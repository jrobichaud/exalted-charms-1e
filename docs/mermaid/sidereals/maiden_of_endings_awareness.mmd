        Prior Warning<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 6 motes<br>
        Duration: Five hours<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Once a Sidereal commits Essence to this Charm, her
        perceptions constantly probe into the immediate future
        for anything that could do her harm. When the character
        is in danger, her player makes a reflexive Wits +
        Awareness roll. If she succeeds, the character has a
        feeling of ill ease that informs her of impending danger.
        The character gets a warning period of two minutes per
        success rolled. This Charm only allows the Sidereal to
        spot obvious harm: Slow-acting poison concealed in her
        ale would not set off the alarm, as the effect is too far in
        the future. However, it might be triggered just before the
        effects kick in, giving the character time to deduce the
        cause and seek a cure.

        <br>
        The character has a general idea of the bad things
        that will happen to him in the course of his life. When
        an unpleasant moment impends, this awareness crystallizes.
        This Charm activates automatically when
        something unexpectedly dangerous or awful is about to
        happen, and the character learns its general nature
        (&quot;attack,&quot; &quot;poison,&quot; &quot;betrayal,&quot; &quot;loss of loved one,&quot; &quot;hu-
        miliation&quot;). The character has one turn's warning in
        which to turn his fate aside. Ambushes against the
        character automatically fail, but the character does not
        automatically detect his attacker.

        Supernal Awareness<br>

        Cost: 4 motes<br>

        The character can see the web of fate around her as
        it cascades into the unavoidable reality of the present.
        With this Charm, she can focus enough attention upon
        the influx of destiny to watch continuously, out to a
        distance of (her Essence x 100) yards, for specific disturbances
        in that web. She can either keep track of people
        within that region, monitor spirits within that region or
        watch for some specific phenomenon such as combat,
        the use of Essence or the mention of her name. She senses
        only vague details — specifically, she can identify the
        location and power level of what she sees and recognize
        specific effects or people she is familiar with, but she
        cannot follow the course of events. For example, when
        monitoring Essence use, she might recognize the invocation
        of the Expected Pain Charm, which she knows well.
        Unless she has seen it often, however, the Ten Ox
        Meditation (see Exalted, p. 196) would register only as
        an Essence 3 Charm. In neither case would she know the
        specific effects of the Charm, such as what object a Solar
        used Ten Ox Meditation to destroy. The effects of this
        Charm are cumulative: If a Sidereal uses it five times in
        a scene, she can monitor five different things.<br>
        Supernal Awareness does not rely on any of the
        character's senses. Normal Stealth and Charms that
        make the character physically invisible or silent have
        no effect.

        Life is full of choices. This Charm gives a Sidereal
        the edge on mere mortals by allowing him to make the
        best choice when confronted with many options. However,
        this Charm allows only a brief peek into the future,
        not an extended glimpse into all the consequences of the
        decision. The ideal short-term outcome is guaranteed,
        but long-term gains are not.

        No one can hide from their past. It unwinds inevitably,
        event cascading into event, rolling from the then
        into the now and finally into an inescapable collection
        of destinies. Characters with this Charm can track others
        not by the physical marks they leave on the world, but by
        the impressions their passage leaves on the destinies of
        everything around them. In a relatively uninhabited
        region, the character can follow a trail as old as one day
        per point of her permanent Essence. In a more populous
        region, where many people leave their marks on fate -
        and, more importantly, where those marks interact with
        one another in a progressively unruly and chaotic fash-
        ion — this Charm is less effective. In such places, the
        character is limited to following trails no older than one
        hour per point of her permanent Essence.<br>
        This ability can be foiled by use of the Traceless
        Passage Charm (see Exalted, p. 182) and similar Charms.
        If the target uses such a Charm, resolve the matter with
        a standard opposed tracking contest.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and the Scythe. The character
        holds it up before her target. It fixes itself in the air
        and begins to blossom with pungent violet flowers,
        whose petals dry, fall off and turn to dust in the course
        of seconds, each replaced as it dies with another
        flower's blooming.<br>
        The target of this Charm finds himself caught in a
        vision of his own ending: transported to a likely end for
        his life, a few hours, minutes or turns before its conclusion
        comes. Roll his permanent Willpower against a
        difficulty of 3. Success indicates that the Charm fazes
        him but has no other effect. Failure indicates that he
        returns from the vision deeply shaken. Reduce his temporary
        Willpower to 1. His Personal Essence pool is
        instantly lost; reduce his temporary Essence by the amount
        of his Personal Essence, to a minimum of 0. He cannot
        recover Willpower or personal Essence for the remainder
        of the scene.<br>
        If the victim is a Storyteller character, the rules
        above suffice. Otherwise, the Storyteller should play
        the vision out. This occurs at a convenient time:
        immediately, as the next scene, or at the end of the
        session, depending on the play group's style. The Sto-
        ryteller devises an interesting and ideally appropriate
        scenario for the target's most likely ending. As events
        progress, the target can alter the scenario in one small
        way for each point of permanent Essence he possesses.
        Motes, Willpower, experience points and health levels
        spent or recovered in the vision do not affect the
        character's actual totals.<br>
        If, through interesting roleplay, luck or martial
        cleverness, the target manages to survive his impending
        doom, he suffers no permanent ill effects. Further, when
        he finishes processing the vision, a few scenes later, he
        generally recovers his full temporary Willpower.<br>
        If the target dies in the vision but his player made his
        permanent Willpower roll, above, the character suffers
        no permanent ill effects save disquiet.<br>
        If the target dies in the vision and failed his permanent
        Willpower roll, his player must roll the character's
        permanent Essence and permanent Willpower. (He cannot
        spend Willpower on these rolls.) Failure on either
        roll means losing one dot of the appropriate Trait, to a
        minimum of 1. No matter what he rolls, he cannot
        recover his Personal Essence for the remainder of the
        story. He only has access to Peripheral Essence.<br>
        This Charm has no effect on Abyssal Exalted or the
        dead. It specifically affects Second and Third Circle
        demons, despite their normal immunity to Willpower
        loss from Sidereal Charms.
