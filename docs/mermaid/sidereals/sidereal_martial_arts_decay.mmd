        ...whose lover's practices displeased the sun. The all-
        seeing sun no longer could sustain<br>
        Tormenting the enemy like the bites of a hundred
        mosquitoes, the character delivers a spark of poisoned
        Essence into the core of his enemy's soul. This is an
        infectious Martial Arts attack that carries the White
        Sun Sickness.<br>
        A victim of White Sun Sickness suffers from a fever
        of the soul. Each time she spends motes of Essence on a
        Charm, the disease increases the Charm's cost by l mote.
        This effect is a cumulative one: The second expenditure
        costs 2 extra motes, the third costs three, and so forth.
        Reduce the accumulated total by five in each day the
        victim spends no motes. The victim also hallucinates. In
        stressful situations, this reduces all of her dice pools by
        her own permanent Essence. Without external stressors,
        she may detach entirely from reality. Finally, the victim
        gains Limit at twice the normal rate. This is a coincidental
        interaction with the Great Curse and not a direct
        effect of the Charm.<br>
        White Sun Sickness occurs in nature. It afflicts —
        though very rarely — those who spend too long meditating
        on the ways of the Fair Folk, the ever-changing spirit
        of Luna, the power of the Elemental Dragons or the
        inspiring greatness of the Unconquered Sun.<br>

        These practices, but with enraged disdain, darts forth
        such pestilent malignant beams,
        Her fingers brushing past the victim's defenses like
        contaminated water seeping into a pool, the character
        infects a victim's Essence with the spastic, divisive
        Drunken Moth Sickness. This is an infectious Martial
        Arts attack.<br>
        A victim of Drunken Moth Sickness no longer
        entirely controls his behavior. The disease comes with a
        general purpose specified by the Sidereal - something
        like &quot;embarrass yourself,&quot; &quot;protect me&quot; or &quot;beat up your
        friends.&quot; In each turn, the character has three choices:
        Use a simple Charm, use a Combo, or spend at least half
        of his non-reflexive actions serving the disease's purpose.
        (Splitting his dice pool or buying extra actions is recom-
        mended — if he only takes one action, then it goes to the
        illness.) The disease only forces him to take action when
        an obvious way of fulfilling its purpose exists, either
        without using Charms or using Charms already active.
        Otherwise, the actions that go to the Drunken Moth
        Sickness are wasted — the character does nothing.<br>
        This disease occasionally occurs in nature, generally
        when someone eats something into which a spirit has
        been bound.<br>

        As shed infection on air, earth and streams;
        One precise punch or kick disrupts the entire functioning
        of the victim's body and soul, shattering his
        Essence into the jagged pattern characteristic of the
        Jigsaw Organ Condition. This is an infectious Martial
        Arts attack.<br>
        A victim of the Jigsaw Organ Condition lacks the
        physical coherence of his peers. Struck in combat, he
        loses limbs or extremities with abnormal ease, simply
        falling apart. Fortunately, when he does lose a limb, he
        need simply stick it back on, and it begins to heal.
        Similarly, if he loses an organ, he can spend a turn
        swallowing it, and it slides back into place. Individual
        organs remain alive, connected and under the victim's
        control when separated from the body. The victim still
        takes damage normally, however, due to the sheer physical
        trauma of it. Whenever a victim suffers damage, roll
        his Stamina against a difficulty equal to the number of
        health levels lost. On a failure, a limb falls off, he coughs
        out a lung, or some similar event transpires.<br>
        If the Sidereal successfully infects someone with
        this disease, the target automatically loses a limb or
        organ of the Sidereal's choice. The Exalt can attempt
        to catch it with a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics action
        at her full dice pool. For example, she might infect her
        victim with a measured blow to the back, cartwheeling
        past him to catch his heart as he coughs it into her
        hands. She can again force a lost limb of her choice and,
        again, try to catch it, any time she does damage to the
        afflicted target - the target cannot defend himself
        with a Stamina roll.<br>
        Defensive Charms only protect such organs or
        limbs as they are naturally applicable to. By default,
        limited leverage reduces the dice pool for a severed
        limb's actions to 0 before the influence of Charms.
        Further, most Charms simply do not function when
        employed by a severed organ. However, appropriate
        stunts or the help of a friend can give a victim's limb
        access to his full dice pool.<br>
        The Sidereal Exalted are only aware of 40 naturally
        contracted cases of Jigsaw Organ Condition this Age.<br>
        The vector for this disease is unknown.<br>

        From whence this malady its birth received.<br>
        The character's understanding of the art of infectious
        martial arts increases. She learns the 25 underlying
        principles of infection and may apply them in combination
        to inflict arbitrary First or Second Circle illnesses
        upon her opponent. This requires an infectious Martial
        Arts attack supplemented by this Charm.<br>
        Characters develop their own First or Second Circle
        infections for use with Essence-Disrupting Infectious
        Atemi. Creating such a sickness requires an Intelligence
        + Medicine roll. The player describes the disease desired,
        and the Storyteller decides upon its Circle and treatment
        difficulties. The difficulty of the Medicine roll equals the
        Magical Treatment Difficulty for the sickness. Reduce
        this difficulty by one point if another Sidereal Exalted
        teaches the character how to inflict the disease. The
        Sidereal can attempt to realize a general infection concept,
        her player making the appropriate roll, no more
        than once per story.<br>
        Normally, characters practice the infliction of new
        spiritual infections before testing them in battle. Developing
        diseases on the fly imposes a +2 difficulty penalty.
        It also requires the Storyteller's permission and requires
        a separate action from the blow that inflicts the disease.

        ...On him the dreadful lot did fall, who now was placed
        before the altar bound,<br>
        With precise blows, the character batters the target
        into the perfect shape written into the core of the target's
        Essence. Violent as the Exalt's attacks may be, they do no
        damage. The target's bones and flesh, when struck, slide
        perfectly into their most appropriate place. The Sidereal's
        player rolls Dexterity + Martial Arts against a difficulty
        equal to the target's Essence. Add the character's Medicine
        score in automatic successes. The target can dodge
        or parry normally. If the Sidereal hits, the target experiences
        the following beneficial effects:<br>
        • The target heals all bashing damage.<br>
        • The target heals a number of lethal damage levels
        equal to the character's Martial Arts score. Treat any
        aggravated damage levels as two lethal damage levels,
        and heal them first.<br>
        • The target can immediately spend one experience
        point to heal one point of permanent Trait loss. This
        cannot raise a Trait above the highest level previously
        purchased. (In other words, the target cannot lose a
        point of Willpower, buy it back between stories and then
        take advantage of this Charm to raise it further.)<br>
        • Any effect that has locked the target into an
        undesired shape is instantly shattered.<br>
        After a successful application of this method, the
        target's player must succeed at a Temperance roll against
        difficulty 2, or the target falls unconscious in a moment
        of transcendent ecstasy.<br>
        The character can use this method on herself. This
        Charm does not affect tattooed Lunar Exalted, who treat
        it as an external attempt to modify their shape (see
        Exalted: the Lunars, p. 121).

        His head with sacrificial garlands crowned,

        the blood and tears, the gentle fall of the Sidereal's hands
        or feet upon a target's Essence cleanses the target of

        ity + Martial Arts against a difficulty equal to the target's

        matic successes. The target can dodge or parry normally.

        • Spiritual and physical diseases instantly leave
        her system, and she fully recovers from their effects.
        The Exalt's player must roll Intelligence + Medicine
        against the Magical Treatment Difficulty to cure a

        5) with this Charm.<br>
        • All poison and drugs leave her system, and
        addictions are broken.<br>
        • Any Possession Charm affecting the target is
        broken, and all lingering effects disappear.<br>
        • The Sidereal Exalted can transfer as many motes
        of his Essence to the target as desired.<br>
        • The Sidereal Exalted can transfer as many points
        of his temporary Willpower to the target as desired.<br>
        • Curses upon the target are broken, although
        permanently lost Attributes are not recovered. This
        includes most debilitating effects imposed through non-physical
        means.<br>
        • The character can erase painful memories,
        that he is aware of, which afflict the target. In the
        future, the target must spend a Willpower point to
        recall these memories for a scene, and even then, they
        return only dimly.<br>
        The target has even greater difficulty remembering
        the events leading up to the use of this Charm -
        specifically, the scene in which this Charm was used.
        Remembering those events later requires not simply a
        Willpower point, but a successful Conviction roll against
        difficulty 2. Again, the memory only lasts for a scene.<br>
        The character can use this method on herself.

        The character moves in a sinuous pattern that
        makes the flows of Essence about her weep. An anima
        banner-like effect rises above her, displaying a lattice-
        work of iron dripping with sea water and blood. This is
        the symbol of the sickness named Iphimedeia, the Revel
        Outside the Sealing of the Gates. The air out to (her
        Essence x 10) yards from the character becomes redolent
        with contagion. Starting the next turn, all those within
        that distance of the Exalt risk infection. The Exalt can
        protect a number of allies up to her permanent Essence
        from this effect. This is an infectious Martial Arts attack.
        It does not require that the character strike her targets,
        but perfect blocks and perfect dodges still protect against
        the outpouring of disease.<br>
        A victim of Iphimedeia finds the flesh of his body
        twisting and flowing, melting while remaining yet alive.
        This does one level of unsoakable aggravated damage per
        turn but stops when aggravated damage fills the -0 and -
        I wound tracks. Characters protected against the
        influence of the Wyld do not suffer from this effect.<br>
        The infected also find their legs twitching with the
        desire to dance. In any given turn, a victim can choose
        to succumb, devoting a dice action to dancing, adding
        his Essence in automatic successes to the Performance
        roll and losing control over his movement. He normally
        dances around an object or person chosen by the Story-
        teller at a distance of 10 yards. Alternately, he can resist.
        Struggling with his own body reduces his effective
        Dexterity to O.<br>
        The greater a victim's self-control, the more
        Iphimedeia impedes him. In each turn, he must fail a
        Temperance roll, spend a Willpower point or lose his
        action as patches of the air become as hard as iron to him.
        Choosing to dance does not protect him from this effect.
        If appropriate to the game style, female Dragon-Blooded
        Aspects of Water may find themselves pregnant after
        catching and recovering from Iphimedeia. If so, the child

        Martial Arts attack to contaminate others with
        arbitrary Third Circle illnesses.<br>
        Characters develop their own Third Circle illnesses
        for use with Gentle Touch of the Wicked Hand.
        Infection follows the ordinary rules for infectious Martial
        Arts, save that it is intrinsically more difficult — as
        noted above — to resist Third Circle infection. Creating
        a Third Circle illness requires an Intelligence +
        Medicine roll. The Storyteller sets a difficulty between
        5 and 10, based on the disease's effects. Reduce this
        difficulty by one point if another Sidereal teaches the
        character how to inflict this disease. The Sidereal can
        attempt to realize a general infection concept, her
        player making the appropriate roll, no more than once
        in every year.<br>
        Normally, characters practice the infliction of
        new spiritual infections before testing them in battle.
        Developing diseases on the fly imposes a +2 difficulty
        penalty. It also requires the Storyteller's permission
        and requires a separate action from the blow that
        inflicts the disease.

        what is whole<br>
        The character learns to guard himself and others
        from even the most terrible attacks. This Charm
        manipulates one target's Essence. Under its effects,
        she automatically converts any aggravated damage
        she receives to lethal damage, before soak. This
        stacks with Charms that convert lethal to bashing
        damage; characters under both effects convert all
        damage directly to bashing. The character can use
        this Charm on himself.

        Essence-Shattering Typhoon<br>

        Type: Simple<br>

        and what is diseased.&quot;&quot;
        The character's fists blur as she pounds them
        against the air, shattering the currents of the world
        and casting a storm of broken and tainted Essence
        toward her foes. In the first turn, the effects extend
        three yards beyond her fists. Anyone and anything
        immediately in front of her suffers either 15 dice of
        aggravated damage or a Third Circle illness she has
        learned to inflict (targets can resist the disease
        normally.) This is an unblockable, undodgeable
        effect. For each turn that the Exalt continuously
        performs this Charm, the effects stretch one mile
        further forward and a tenth of a mile further to each
        side. This Charm is a semi-physical effect, and does
        not reach through unbroken walls, earth, trees, etc.
        until the turn it either destroys them or has a route
        around them. It does not extend behind the character
        or to her sides.
