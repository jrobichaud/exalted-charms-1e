        Cost: None<br>

        <br>
        The character trains himself for instant acceptance
        of the twists and turns of circumstance. In any given
        combat, in the first turn he acts, he doubles his base
        initiative (Dexterity + Wits). Charms such as Opportune
        Shot and Thunderclap Rush Attack do not automatically
        win initiative over him. These advantages cease to apply
        once he takes his first non-reflexive action. There is no
        cost to use this Charm - learning this Charm permanently
        enhances the Exalt's capabilities.

        The character moves with the swift precision of one
        who knows her destiny. For each mote of Essence spent,
        she adds one point to her initiative for the remainder of
        the scene. Multiple applications of this Charm are cumulative,
        but she cannot add more than her Martial Arts to
        her initiative with any combination of effects that includes
        this Charm.

        Essence shines around the characters hands (or
        weapons), tracing with their every movement crim-
        son trails through the air. For each 2 motes spent, the
        character adds one die to each unarmed Martial Arts
        attack and parry she makes for the remainder of the
        scene. Multiple applications of this Charm are cumulative,
        but she cannot more than double her
        normal Dexterity + Martial Arts pool with any
        combination of effects. While under this effect, her
        hands may safely parry even lethal damage blows,
        although blocking arrows or magical attacks requires
        a well-described stunt.

        Those who routinely face terrible odds can learn to
        take some measure of happiness in each moment's
        survival. Once having activated this Charm, the player
        rolls the Sidereal's Essence each time the character
        successfully blocks or dodges an attack. Each success
        indicates two motes of Essence, flavored by the tang of
        Serenity, that she recovers. This Charm does not activate
        against attacks not truly intended to harm the
        Sidereal, nor against attacks from enemies too weak to
        do her any real harm.

        The character adopts the cold detachment with
        which Saturn makes her Sign against those things whose
        time has passed. While the character uses the Violet Bier
        of Sorrows Form, each successful attack also drains some
        of the victim's passion. After damaging an opponent
        with an unarmed Martial Arts attack, the Exalt can
        remove one point of one of the target's Virtues, to a
        minimum of 1. This cannot reduce a target's Virtues
        below the minimums required for the Great Curse. For
        example, if a Solar's Virtue Flaw is Compassionate Martyrdom
        (see Exalted, p. 131), this Form cannot reduce
        his Compassion below 3. However, it can reduce a spirit,
        elemental or demon's Virtues below the minimum level
        necessary to use a given Charm, in which case the spirit
        loses access to that Charm until its Virtue recovers. Each
        Virtue heals at the rate of one point a day.
        This Form changes the normal minimum for damage
        dice. While it is active, after a successful and
        potentially damaging unarmed Martial Arts attack, the
        character always rolls at least her Martial Arts score in
        damage dice.
        This Charm is also called the &quot;Endings Form.&quot;

        In a blur of violet Essence, the character's blade
        catches an attack that might otherwise have killed
        him. If the character tries and fails to parry a blockable
        attack, he may decide — after damage is rolled — to
        invoke this Charm, reducing the damage by one level
        per 2 motes spent.

        Drawing on the Essence of Endings, a character can
        add power to a blow that he realizes is about to pierce his
        enemy's defenses. As soon as a character hits an opponent
        with an unarmed attack, his player can declare the
        use of this Charm, purchasing automatic damage successes
        at a cost of 2 motes each. He cannot purchase more
        than his character's Essence in automatic successes. This
        Charm applies to unarmed Brawl attacks and is explicitly
        permitted to share a Combo with Brawl Charms; the
        disciplined approach of a martial artist is necessary only
        in the last instant of the blow.

        Not even the most cunning of opponents can evade
        a sword that strikes everywhere at once. For each 3 motes
        spent, the character can make an extra unarmed Martial
        Arts attack at her full dice pool. All her attacks must be
        made against the same target. She cannot make more
        total attacks than her Martial Arts, nor can she split her
        dice pool in the same turn she uses Metal Storm.

        At the pinnacle of the Violet Bier of Sorrows
        Style, a character learns to draw strength from the pain
        of others. Her attacks gain resolve as her enemy falters.
        She is trained to take full advantage of the weakness of
        the wounded, stalking failing prey as death hunts those
        whose time has come. Whenever she successfully harms
        an opponent with an unarmed Martial Arts attack, she
        gains one point of Willpower. In addition, an
        opponent's wound penalties are tripled when it comes
        to attacking her or defending against her unarmed
        Martial Arts attacks.<br>
        Sidereal Exalted, and those who learn this Charm as
        a Sidereal Charm, can enhance it with a prayer strip
        marked with the scripture of the Expectant Maiden. The
        character fixes it to her sword (or other allowed weapon),
        wrapping the whole in a radiant burgundy light. While
        the prayer strip survives, her weapon cannot be destroyed,
        and each successful Martial Arts attack subtracts
        a Willpower point from the target. Creatures outside of
        fate and targets with 0 Willpower instead lose 10 motes
        of Essence. If the target does not have 10 motes to lose,
        convert all damage dice to automatic successes instead.
