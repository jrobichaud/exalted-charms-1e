        The character's Caste Mark shimmers, casting forth
        an appropriately colored light only visible to spirits and
        the Chosen of her caste. This light reveals unmanifested
        spirits to those who can see it. In addition, the Sidereal
        adds one automatic success to all Presence, Performance,
        Occult, Bureaucracy and Socialize rolls made when
        dealing with spirits or in Yu-Shan. This explicitly stacks
        with effects that add dice to her pool, even if it exceeds
        the dice limit. Sidereal Exalted may always use their
        Compassion with this Charm. Learning this Charm
        requires the appropriate Maiden's approval.

        To help the character better untangle the threads of
        fate, impelled by the earliest laws of Creation, the
        patterns of Essence around the character sing. Charms,
        sorcery and other effects give rise to strange but fitting
        melodies. Spirits - manifested or otherwise â€” emit a
        soft and inadvertent noise, like the ringing of bells. Only
        Sidereal Exalted can hear this music.<br>
        Both the character and other Sidereals within earshot
        can detect the presence of enchantments and
        unmanifested spirits automatically. An Intelligence +
        Occult roll against difficulty 3 allows Sidereal Exalted
        with this Charm to identify the details of an enchant-
        ment, the approximate rank and job description for a
        given spirit or the minutiae of the local geomantic
        environment.

        Invoking the blessing of his Maiden, the character
        facilitates polite dealings with the spirit world. Spirits
        and elementals with the Sidereal's Essence or lower must
        spend 2 temporary Willpower to initiate hostile action
        against the character. In addition, each Charm they use
        in a conflict they initiate costs 1 additional Willpower.
        (This includes Charms that do not normally cost Will-
        power.) Learning this Charm requires the appropriate
        Maiden's approval.

        Wrapped in the terrible grandeur of the Maiden
        that sponsors her, the Sidereal can present a compelling
        case for her intentions. If her player succeeds at a
        Charisma + Occult roll against a difficulty equal to the
        target's Essence, the Sidereal acquires a god's support
        in some political matter. The god must not be intractably
        opposed to the Sidereal, and the Sidereal can
        attempt this Charm at most once per year against a
        given target. When used by the losing side in a celestial
        audit, each use of this Charm counts as an independent
        Severity 3 offense. When used by the winning side,
        there is no penalty. (Helping others agree with the
        truth, as the censor's final opinion defines it, is no
        crime.) Sidereal Exalted may always use their Valor
        with this Charm. Learning this Charm requires the
        appropriate Maiden's approval.

        Sidereals with a deep understanding of the ways of
        the Wyld and the dead can apply it to their manipulation
        of fate. With a deft touch on the weave, the character
        corrupts the pattern of a person's existence with the
        essence of chaos and endings. She inflicts her Essence in
        dice of unsoakable aggravated damage on any creature or
        object she can see. This damage cannot be blocked or
        dodged. The Unweaving Method cannot harm the dead
        and has no effect on characters or items shielded from
        the influence of the Wyld.

        For the Sidereal Exalted, steeped in the lore of the
        First Age, Terrestrial Circle Sorcery comes easily. Note
        that invoking this Charm only enables the character to
        cast a single Terrestrial Circle spell. The actual spell
        itself has an Essence cost, often very high, that the
        character must pay to actualize the spell. This cost is
        listed in the spell's description. Terrestrial Circle Sorcery
        can never be part of a Combo.

        use one of the scriptures found upon the Maidens' Loom,
        unlock a path in their minds through which they may
        learn Celestial Circle Sorcery. The first time they cast a
        Celestial Circle spell, they must also sacrifice a prayer
        strip inscribed with the scripture of the Maiden in
        Chains, which burns away in a gout of emerald fire.
        Celestial Circle Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.
