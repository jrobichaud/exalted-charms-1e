        The natural residents of Creation deform the flow of
        others' fates, marking it with the signs of their presence.
        Using this Charm, the character reduces this deformation,
        stepping lightly through the world the Maidens
        weave. For one scene, she reduces the target number of
        any roll to remain undetected.

        Quiet as the Void, the Sidereal steps entirely out of
        the weave of fate. Only those with Essence greater than
        her own can sense her directly. The touch of chance
        allows others a reflexive Perception + Awareness roll
        for others to feel a presence nearby. Even if they
        succeed, those who cannot sense her directly have a +2
        difficulty penalty on attempts to attack her or affect her
        with Charms. Only supernatural trackers can engage in
        tracking contests with the character. The Exalt returns
        instantly to the weave if her anima banner makes
        Stealth Charms fail.<br>
        For the duration of this Charm, the Sidereal is
        treated as a creature outside of fate. Learning this Charm
        requires the Maiden of Secrets' approval.

        The character can only use this Charm while Walking
        Outside Fate. Any spirit or Sidereal present hears the
        character's words as his own thoughts. A target can
        dismiss them as irrelevant internal monologue, but his
        player must make a Perception + Awareness roll at
        difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence to realize that
        the thoughts are not his own.

        Casting forth shadows of a thousand possible
        futures, the Sidereal conceals the truths of her existence
        from another. Although the character remains
        apparent to every sense, focusing on her to determine
        her exact location, her body language, what she is
        saying or any other detail becomes near-impossible.
        The player makes a Manipulation + Stealth roll. Add
        her successes to the difficulty of all attempts the
        target makes to attack, dodge or otherwise influence
        the Sidereal for the Charm's duration. If the player
        receives even one success, the target cannot understand
        the Sidereal's words. Sidereal Exalted may
        always use their Valor with this Charm.

        Technique, Blinding the Boar
        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of Absence. The character places it upon
        her chest. Flashing with dark green light, it sinks
        inside and wraps around her heart. In that instant, the
        Sidereal vanishes from the weave of fate and reap-
        pears elsewhere, woven seamlessly into a new life. No
        effect that targets the Sidereal based on her identity
        rather than her physical location functions. For the
        time being, although others remember her, the Sidereal
        simply does not exist.<br>
        The character creates a new identity and appearance
        for herself as any sort of non-Primordial
        creature, including mortals, Exalted, spirits and the
        dead. She cannot, however, become someone who
        already exists.<br>
        The character chooses up to 15 dots of Back-
        grounds appropriate to her new life; Background dots
        above 3 cost double. She travels instantly to a loca-
        tion chosen by the Maiden of Secrets to fit her new
        identity. She instantly develops appropriate social
        relationships, seamlessly integrating into the life of
        any appropriate entities save creatures of the Wyld,
        beings outside the pattern of fate and spirits on or
        above the level of the Maidens. Thus, if the character
        chose to assume the identity of an Abyssal Exalted,
        the dead of her &quot;native&quot; shadowland would recognize
        and remember her as such, but the Deathlord that was
        her ostensible superior would not.<br>
        The character does not gain new Abilities.
        When possible, others perceive her Charms and
        anima as effects suitable to her new self. When
        magic or ignorance betrays the character, she
        automatically receives a perfect success on social rolls
        to explain the matter away. Others have no difficulty
        perceiving or remembering the Sidereal's temporary
        identity, unless the temporary identity is itself a
        Sidereal. However, the character's tendency to fade
        from view prevents her from spending more than one
        season a year as another person.<br>
        If the Sidereal dismisses this Charm or uses more
        than 10 motes of Peripheral Essence, the Charm
        ends. Its effects linger on for five days, after which
        the Sidereal snaps back to her old identity and its
        appropriate location.
