        The character scuttles on the threads of fate like a
        pattern spider. He can run through or stand upon the air
        as easily as on the ground. He can reflexively spend a
        mote of Essence to dematerialize from the beginning of
        his initiative to the beginning of his next initiative,
        allowing him to become as invisible and intangible as
        those who weave fate. This does not count against his
        actions for the turn. When he is under this Charm's
        influence, the Sidereal's gait both disturbs and horrifies
        those who see it. Except for the Sidereal's allies, the
        player of a witness who does not have this Charm must
        succeed at a difficulty 1 Valor roll each turn, or her
        character loses her action.

        Arrows fell upon her, forcing her to descend.
        This Charm emulates a spider's motion, balanced
        on six legs and striking with two, never lacking the
        leverage — regardless of what might tangle its blows —
        for a lightning retreat or advance. The character begins
        a shuffling, sliding, shifting kata, her feet constantly in
        motion and nearly impossible for mortal eyes to track.
        Only the third of three separate, successful attempts can
        sweep her, knock her down, clinch or hold her or make
        a targeted attack against her lower body.<br>
        When the character uses this kata, she can shift
        herself almost instantaneously out of the path of a blow.
        Becoming aware of a physical attack allows her to glide
        away, moving up to twice her Dexterity in yards. If the
        attack can hit her at this range — as with archery or the
        Lightning Strike Style (see Exalted: the Dragon-Blooded,
        p. 246) — this Charm increases any associated range
        penalties. Attacks that must hit her before she moves
        away (such as hand-to-hand attacks if she puts more than
        three yards between herself and her attacker) suffer a
        dice pool penalty equal to half the character's initiative
        for that turn, rounded up. After the first attack, the
        attacker must move into range again to hit her at all.
        Similarly, the character can glide forward up to twice her
        Dexterity in yards to make any of her unarmed Martial
        Arts attacks. Attempts to parry her attack suffer a dice
        pool penalty equal to half her initiative for the turn,
        rounded up. Dodging her requires less awareness of her
        angle of approach; dodge attempts only suffer a penalty
        equal to her permanent Essence.<br>
        When a character uses this Charm to dart quickly
        through her enemies, splitting her Martial Arts action to
        maximize the extra movement derived from this Charm,
        it is sometimes called the Dance of the Pouncing Spider.
        When she uses it to skate away from a barrage of arrows,
        quickly exceeding their maximum range, it is the Dance
        of the Spider in the Rain.

        But the Essence burning within her set the arrows afire.
        The character's fingers rain across her opponent like
        a thousand poisoned fangs, tainting the target's Essence
        so that his soul begins to dissolve from the inside. The
        character makes a normal unarmed Dexterity + Martial
        Arts attack, which does normal damage. In addition, the
        target begins to hemorrhage Essence. He loses 5 motes
        every turn, exactly as if he had spent them. This effect
        lasts one turn for each damage die rolled. Multiple
        applications of this effect are cumulative. When the
        target runs out of motes, he collapses, comatose, for a
        number of days equal to the character's Martial Arts.
        Storyteller characters may die outright. Given three
        turns of physical contact with a comatose target, a
        character with this Charm can suck out and devour the
        target's soul. This restores the devourer's temporary
        Essence to its normal maximum. The target does not
        move on to the afterlife. If the character consumes a
        Celestial Exalt, she will grow sick sometime within the
        next three days and spit out the indigestible Celestial
        Essence, suffering six dice of lethal damage in the process,
        which ignores armor and soak.

        She answered the arrows' flight with a storm of her own.
        The character casts forth a number of hair-fine
        threads equal to his permanent Essence. Each can at-
        tempt one of the following maneuvers, at a range of (the
        Sidereal's Essence x 10) yards:<br>
        • Pick up a single unattended weapon or object.
        Attacking or parrying with a weapon held by a thread is
        a normal Martial Arts action.<br>
        • Pierce an opponent's skin, as a normal Martial
        Arts attack that does lethal damage.<br>
        • Disarm, sweep or hold an opponent (see Exalted,
        pp. 238-240). This attack uses the character's full Dexter-
        ity + Martial Arts pool and does not count against the
        character's actions. Further, the character can maintain
        a hold with his full Strength + Martial Arts pool, without
        losing or splitting his action, so long as he invokes this
        Charm every turn. However, each thread can hold only
        a single limb; a held character can take actions with her
        other limbs. If the character devotes multiple threads to
        holding an opponent, resolve the attack with a single roll.<br>
        Make reflexive Perception + Awareness or Perception
        + Martial Arts checks at difficulty 4 for other
        characters to see the threads. Otherwise, except for
        attacks with a visible weapon, targets are unaware of
        the attack and can only use defenses that specifically
        state they work on attacks the character is not aware
        of. The threads are tangible and slightly reflective,
        and opponents can use stunts to make them easier to
        spot or predict.

        And the small maiden began<br>
        Hundreds of near-invisible filaments spun from the
        character's Essence launch from her hands, whipping
        around physical and spiritual leverage points and weaving
        amongst themselves to snarl and tangle all opponents
        within (the Sidereal's Essence x 10) yards. Each turn, the
        Sidereal's player reflexively rolls Dexterity + Martial
        Arts. Enemies inside the Charm's area of effect, or who
        enter that area before the character's next turn, suffer a
        cumulative penalty to their dice pools for all physical
        actions equal to half the number of successes. They
        receive the same penalty to their natural movement rate
        in yards. This penalty fades by one die and one yard per
        turn that the victim spends outside the radius, as the
        threads reluctantly disentangle themselves.<br>
        The weave of thread moves with the character,
        easily catching new opponents brought into the radius
        and twitching out of the way of those she wishes to give
        unhampered passage. If the character does not keep
        moving, the threads thicken toward the point of visibility,
        first as glints of reflected light in the air, then a faint
        visual impression like cobweb and ultimately (after five
        minutes of stillness) an opaque forest of webbing around
        the character, as impassible - for those she does not
        offer passage to — as stone (use the statistics for Stone
        Wall on page 239 of Exalted for each one-yard cube
        attackers wish to clear).

        to climb the waterspout again.<br>
        The character moves in the fashion of an arachnid
        sifu, her hands weaving lazily through three sets of
        interwoven kata. Such is her grace and coordination, in
        Essence as in body, that she may take three fully independent
        physical actions in each turn. For example, she
        might invoke a full dodge when attacked, then invoke
        Flight of Mercury while making an ordinary Martial Arts
        attack and, finally, split her dice pool to use Maw of
        Dripping Venom against two nearby opponents.<br>
        Fully independent actions follow exactly the same
        rules as taking single actions on multiple successive
        turns, except that:<br>
        • Only one turn actually passes, which matters for
        some Charm effects and durations and also means the
        sutra discount applies only once.<br>
        • Characters who have split dice pools can interweave
        their actions. For example, they can split one
        action's dice pool between an attack and a parry, taking
        another action in between.<br>
        • The character only moves once.<br>
        • Characters cannot also use extra action Charms or
        Combos containing those Charms when taking more
        than one independent action.<br>
        In addition, if the character chooses to use this
        ability in a given turn, she cannot take any non-reflexive
        dice actions depending on Social or Mental Attributes.
        (This final limit is not intrinsic to fully independent
        actions, but a feature of this Form.) The character does
        not have to use this ability in a given turn if she would
        prefer to use an extra action Charm, use a Combo or take
        a Social or Mental action.<br>
        Characters using the Charcoal March of Spiders
        Form automatically receive the benefits of the Unnatural
        Many-Step Stride and Dance of the Hungry Spider in
        every turn.<br>
        Characters cannot use more than one Martial Arts
        Form-type Charm at a time.

        The Elder Sutra of Consumption: The maiden became
        a mother...<br>
        Just as the widow spider devours her mate to feed a
        thousand children, the character consumes the force of
        one blow to give rise to a wind of vengeance. She may use
        this Charm immediately after someone successfully attacks
        her. The swirling pattern of her hands forms a raw
        vortex to draw in and disrupt the Essence and physical
        substance of the attack. She immediately inflicts her
        Dexterity + Martial Arts in dice of unblockable,
        undodgeable lethal damage against an unarmed attacker
        or shatters any mortal weapon used against her. If this kills
        an unarmed attacker or destroys an armed attacker's
        weapon, she takes no damage from the attack. Her opponent
        can use a perfect block or a perfect dodge to avoid the
        vortex damage - however, this requires aborting the
        original attack, and again, the Sidereal takes no damage.
        Either way, from the heart of the vortex, the Exalt may
        issue a number of unarmed counterattacks equal to her
        Martial Arts score, doubling their raw damage. She can
        use this Charm in response to a counterattack Charm
        such as Crimson Palm Counterstrike but does not receive
        counterattacks against any counterattack Charm.

        And to one child she said, &quot;I have many things to
        show you.&quot;<br>
        In the jungles of the East, one sometimes finds nests
        of thumbnail spiders: thousands or millions of tiny spiders
        sharing a funnel-shaped web. They normally wait
        for prey to fall into their home but are more than happy
        to swarm over anyone or anything that arouses their ire
        When something destroys their web, such spiders migrate
        for miles, devouring everything they pass, until
        they decide upon a new home. A character using this
        Charm is every bit as destructive. He moves up to (his
        Essence x 10) yards and makes three Martial Arts attacks
        at his full dice pool. Every opponent within five yards of
        his path suffers the effects of each attack. Each dodges or
        blocks individually. If the targets have defensive effects
        that hurt attackers - such as counterattacks, spines or
        an angry invocation of the Shield of Mars - the character
        is immune to the effect. The blur of his passing fist or
        foot fades away into nothingness as the counterattack
        triggers, for the death of a single spider does not hurt the
        swarm. The Exalt's attacks affect both material and
        spiritual targets with equal facility, and the character can
        launch these attacks while dematerialized.<br>
        Characters using Thumbnail Spider March do not
        receive offensive benefits from reflexive movement
        Charms such as the Dance of the Hungry Spider, although
        they can still receive defensive benefits.

        And to another, she said, &quot;You may rest within my
        home, and eat; no need to fly.&quot;<br>
        In the South, surrounded by the sands, there
        stands the great idol Ma-Un-Enle, and there are spi-
        ders that come before it. Sometimes, a spider hears
        Ma-Un-Enle speak a name, and it bows with all its legs,
        and it walks out into the wind. It buries itself under the
        sands, growing ever larger with age, for hundreds or
        thousands of years. Then, when the person whose
        name it has heard comes within 10 miles, it strikes in
        one smooth bound. A character using this Charm can
        spring at any visible target, issuing an unarmed attack
        at the completion of that leap.<br>
        Against a person, this attack does normal damage,
        adding the character's Essence in automatic successes to
        the damage roll. In addition, the target's player must
        make a reflexive opposed roll of Stamina + Resistance
        against a difficulty equal to the Sidereal's Essence; on
        failure, the force of the attack reduces the point of impact
        (such as the target's head or chest) to a cloud of blood and
        dust. The target has one turn left to live, or rather, one
        turn before her Essence realizes that she should be dead.
        No mortal medicine can help. The application of a
        magical effect that heals one or more health levels makes
        her Incapacitated but stable, but with one less dot of
        permanent Stamina.<br>
        Treat attacks against inanimate objects as feats of
        strength used to break them; the character's total on the
        Feats of Strength table (see Exalted, p. 252) is (her
        Essence x 5). This does mean a minimum total of 30 —
        the character automatically shatters cliff faces, but a
        powerful Manse might only lose its gate.

        And to a third, she said, &quot;How beautiful you are.&quot;
        In the oceans of the West live green hunting spiders,
        bulbous and hand-sized, scurrying along the underside of
        the surface as easily as if were a web. They kill fish -
        sometimes, even great sharks or whales — for their meat,
        paralyzing them with a pinprick bite and burrowing into
        their flesh, floating to the surface years later, sated, when
        they have eaten it all. A character with this Charm
        possesses a touch every bit as deadly. With one swift
        blow, she can render an enemy helpless and begin to
        devour him for his Essence.<br>
        To use this Charm, she makes a normal unarmed
        attack. If she succeeds and does even one health level of
        damage, she also paralyzes the Essence of her opponent.
        Paralysis means that the target cannot spend motes,
        cannot regain Willpower or Essence and receives the
        benefits of the Heartless Maiden Trance (see p. 133). He
        can overcome this effect for one turn by spending a
        Willpower point and having his player succeed at a
        reflexive Stamina + Occult roll against a difficulty equal
        to the character's Essence. He must do this successfully
        a number of times equal to the character's Martial Arts
        score to completely free himself from the effects. Mean-
        while, until the victim is completely free, the martial
        artist can spend his motes of Essence as if they were her
        own. This can invoke the target's anima banner but does
        not increase the Sidereal's.<br>
        When a character uses this Charm on a consenting
        subject, allowing her to draw on that subject's Essence,
        it is known instead as Seven-Leg Walking.

        • Transforms the target's flesh into one of the five
        elements: a gust of wind, a gout of fire that fades into ash,
        a statue, a watery haze or a living oak. The target is still
        alive, but unless he is an elemental of the relevant type,
        he can take no actions.<br>
        • Grants the target a new life and identity. This uses
        the same rules as the Ceasing to Exist Approach (see p.
        173), save that the effects are permanent and the target
        forgets his original identity.<br>
        • Unmakes the target utterly. In the unlikely
        event a Primordial fails to use a perfect defense, that
        Primordial becomes a Malfean. Any other target instantly
        ceases to exist, in life and in afterlife, as the
        strands of his Essence come violently apart and scatter
        to the corners of Creation.<br>
        This replaces the normal damage of the attack.
        The reapplication of this Charm, extremely po-
        tent benedictions such as the Endowment spirit Charm
        (see the Exalted Storyteller's Companion, p. 53) and
        specific transformative agents such as the Wondrous
        Lunar Transformation (see Exalted: The Lunars, p.
        130) can return transformed targets to normalcy.
        Gathering the pieces of elementally transformed tar-
        gets before returning them to normalcy is advisable.
        Normally, these methods provide an immediate resto-
        ration. However, targets transformed into other people
        and back may have difficulty relinquishing their new
        memories and recovering the old ones. Nothing can
        remake the unmade.<br>
        This Charm does not affect tattooed Lunar Exalted,
        whose bodies reject external transformation. This ap-
        plies even to the final version of the Charm.

        she ate them.<br>
        To master this style is to approach the grandeur of
        Asna Firstborn herself. When the character strikes, she
        does not seem to move so much as to divide into many
        warriors at once. She may cast forth endless invisible
        filaments of web, as with Rain of Unseen Threads, or
        simply strike so quickly as to occupy many locations
        simultaneously. In either case, fighting her does not
        resemble opposing the master herself so much as chal-
        lenging an army of her young: The attacks rain down
        from every side, skittering inward in the unsettling
        many-stepped strides of the form to surround and
        bewilder her foes.<br>
        The character applies each unarmed Martial Arts
        attack she makes this turn against all visible opponents,
        twice each, regardless of distance. Grandmother Spider
        Mastery, as a simple Charm that cannot be in a Combo,
        gives no benefit to characters without access to fully
        independent actions. (That is, characters not using
        Charcoal March of Spiders Form.)
