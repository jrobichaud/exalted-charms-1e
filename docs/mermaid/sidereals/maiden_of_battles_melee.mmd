        The patterns and flows of a battlefield hold no
        mysteries for the character. She does not need to improvise
        last-second defenses. She notices openings well
        before they appear. She can choose her blows precisely,
        selecting multiple actions that combine harmoniously.
        In the turn in which she invokes this Charm, the
        character can take two extra attack actions, using Archery,
        Brawl, Melee or Thrown. Sidereal Exalted may
        always use their Temperance with this Charm.<br>
        This Charm is explicitly permitted to be in a
        Combo with Charms of other Abilities. Note that the
        rules on Combos may limit the kinds of actions a
        character can take.

        Calm and precision envelops the character as she
        strikes. She adds dice to one Melee attack, increasing it
        to a maximum of its normal pool plus the character's
        Essence. For example, an Essence 3 character who has a
        - 1 wound penalty can spend up to 4 motes to enhance her
        attack. This can overcome penalties that reduce the
        character's dice pool to 0 before Charms. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Temperance with this Charm.

        Manipulating the local flow of a conflict through
        the ripple effects of her own actions, the character
        reduces the target number for a Melee attack or parry.

        A wind full of red stardust and the character's will,
        visible to those who can see dematerialized spirits, spins
        around the character. It reroutes the flows of Essence and
        fate that normally allow others to attack her. A casual
        movement of the Exalt's weapon parries any one incoming
        attack she is aware of, so long as the attack has a
        physical component and is not specifically noted as
        impossible to block. This is not a perfect defense.

        Stirring the currents of fate with the tip of her weapon,
        the character disrupts the path of any attack made against
        her, so long as it passes through any portion of the world
        bound by fate. If she is unaware of the attack, her player
        must make a reflexive Perception + Melee roll at difficulty
        3 to divert the blow. Otherwise, this is a perfect block,
        capable of stopping even unblockable attacks.

        In the moment the character's weapon strikes true,
        the colors around her take on a harsh red tinge. Essence
        dissolves at the weapon's touch. Halve the raw damage
        for one attack, rounding down, but the damage is aggravated.
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden on the Shelf. The character
        places it across his eyes, whereupon it adheres and begins
        to drip with dark blood.
        The character suffers no visibility penalties. All
        opponents and attacks become apparent to him, although
        effects such as the Mental Invisibility Technique can
        force him to ignore them. He sees enemies not as bodies
        and faces but as patterns of fate and potential or — for
        creatures outside of fate — disruptions in such patterns.
        The character can reflexively parry any blockable
        attack with his full Dexterity + Melee dice pool. Once
        per turn, after his initiative, he can reflexively make an
        Archery, Brawl, Melee or Thrown attack at his full dice
        pool. He cannot use the latter ability in any turn where
        he splits his normal dice pool.
