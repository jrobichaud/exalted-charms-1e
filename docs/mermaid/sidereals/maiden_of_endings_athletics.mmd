        Burn Life<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 3 motes per dot<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Athletics: 2<br>
        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        The character draws upon the long thread of his
        own future destiny for power, sacrificing a few days
        or weeks of lifespan to suffuse his physical form with
        Essence. His player rolls Essence + Athletics. Each
        success represents one point that the Exalt can add
        to his Strength, Dexterity or Stamina until the end
        of the scene; he cannot raise any of them by more
        than his Essence. These improvements add normally
        to his damage, running speed or soak. Each
        increase costs 3 motes of Essence and three days of
        lifespan. Successes not paid for are lost. Increases to
        his Attributes are dice bonuses added by a Charm
        and should be considered as such when determining
        the maximum effect of other dice-bonus Charms.
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.

        Hungry Touch<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote per target number reduction or damage point<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>

        With a single blow, the character consumes the
        destiny of an object, bringing that destiny partway
        toward or immediately to its final conclusion. When
        attempting to destroy an object with a feat of
        strength, the character can use this Charm to reduce
        the target number of the Willpower roll to
        boost her Strength + Athletics. If she succeeds at
        destroying the object, she recovers the Willpower
        point spent. Alternately, when attacking an object,
        the character can buy up to her Essence in additional
        points of damage at 1 mote each.

        For a moment, the character cuts the connection
        between herself and the ground, and her destiny lies in
        the air. She triples her leaping distance for a single jump.

        Inexorable Advance<br>

        Cost: 1 mote<br>
        Duration: Five turns<br>

        Eliding the moments of her own life between
        footsteps, or between the beginning of a gesture and its
        end, the character acts without the need for motion.
        She suffers no wound or armor penalties of any sort, nor
        any penalties that reduce her running speed. When
        characters first learn this Charm, their movements
        involve flickering shifts in their position â€” as if others
        saw them through a strobe light. With a few days'
        practice, however, they can smooth out this effect,
        moving with a fluid grace that appears to ignore normal
        anatomical constraints.

        Invisible Motion<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>
        Duration: One day<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Athletics: 4<br>

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and the Dust. The character
        wraps it around his forehead or neck, whereupon it
        exudes a soft scent of lilacs and decay. For the rest of the
        day, the character receives the benefits of the Inexorable
        Advance Charm every turn. This continuous simplification
        of his movements also reduces the fatigue value of
        his armor by two, to a minimum of zero. A fatigue value
        of zero means that the character need never roll to see if
        he becomes fatigued from wearing the armor. In addition,
        the character can compress more action and more
        complex action into the fractional seconds of his life he
        skips over and reduces to instantaneousness. He doubles
        his movement rate and receives a number of automatic
        successes equal to his Athletics score to divide in any
        fashion among his physical actions every turn. The
        character can reserve some of these successes for reflexive
        actions later in the turn, but successes not used by the
        end of each turn are lost.
