        Willful Weapon Method<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 4 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>

        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>

        The Sidereal's eyes reflect a yellow light as she looks
        away from the present and toward the pattern of impending
        fate. She casts the shadow of her weapon from her
        hand, and it speeds toward her target. The player makes
        an attack roll normally, ignoring penalties for range and
        weather. The Sidereal must be able to see the target, and
        the attack must be within the weapon's maximum range
        (normally triple the listed range).<br>
        Even if the character misses, the shadow inexorably
        approaches the target's heart. The next turn, the Sidereal
        can attempt the attack again with a new Thrown roll. This
        is a normal action but uses the shadow weapon already in
        the air. It can be enhanced with appropriate Charms. This
        attack ignores range limitations on the weapon.<br>
        If the shadow hits, the target loses two points of
        temporary Willpower as a spirit-bird screams in the
        mansion of the Gull and the house of Endings quietly
        takes note. In addition, the character's weapon appears,
        quivering, in the target's chest, doing normal damage. If
        the character does not spend a Thrown action every turn
        on this Charm, the shadow fades away.<br>
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Temperance
        with this Charm.

        Life Gets Worse Approach<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 3 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>

        The character makes the Inferior Sign of the Gull
        over his weapon, whispers to it to seek the heart (or some
        other desired organ) and throws. This attack adds his
        Essence to the raw damage of the attack. In addition, if
        the weapon hits, it emits a soft yellow radiance that calls
        to things traveling through the air. Once per turn, when
        someone in range misses with a Thrown or Archery
        attack, the Exalt can reflexively spend 2 motes to summon
        the projectile to the wound. The player of the
        person responsible for the attack must immediately reflexively
        reroll the attack against the target of this
        Charm. All Charms used on the original attack still
        apply except for those inapplicable to the new target and
        those that allow the attack to target multiple characters.
        The Charms need not be paid for again. Removing the
        weapon requires a simple Strength + Athletics action
        and ends the effects of this Charm. If left alone long
        enough, the embedded weapon eventually attracts stray
        insects, birds and flying debris.

        Essence Thorn Practice<br>

        The blade of a knife is the gate between life and
        death. The target's fate is to suffer its touch. The character
        dispenses with the intermediate steps, hurling a blade
        of Essence up to (his Essence x 20) yards. It moves at such
        speed that it cannot be blocked, only dodged, the wind
        of its passage dragging the character up to 20 yards in the
        direction of its travel. It suffers no penalties from range,
        has an accuracy equal to the character's Essence and does
        (Strength + 6L) damage. The character chooses how far
        the blade pulls him toward the target.<br>
        Creatures of the shadowlands have passed beyond
        death's gate, and the Essence Thorn drags them closer to
        life. Hit by the blade, they suffer no damage. Instead,
        convert damage successes one for one into points of temporary
        Willpower lost. Such being can be reduced to a
        minimum of 0 temporary Willpower. If brought to 0 Willpower
        by this attack, the creature suffers hallucinations
        and disorientation, taking no actions save to engage in
        reverie, self-defense or extended self-defense (i.e., escape)
        for the remainder of the scene. Abyssal Exalted are alive
        and take damage. Deathlords are immune to the Essence
        Thorn unless already at 0 Willpower when it strikes them.

        Before making a Thrown attack, the character
        touches her weapon to the skin beneath her eye. She
        bleeds three drops of blood onto the weapon, symbolizing
        the sorrow she might theoretically feel for her impending
        victim. It is the way of fate that pain begets pain. Apply
        the victim's current wound penalty to the target number
        for both the attack and damage rolls. For example, against
        a character with a -2 wound penalty, the target number
        for both rolls would be 5. Sidereal Exalted may always use
        their Compassion with this Charm.

        <br>

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and Shadow. The character casts
        it at an opponent or object as a Thrown weapon with a
        range of 100 yards and Accuracy +0. If it hits, it adheres,
        wreathing the target in an unpleasant, pulsing yellow
        glow. The Exalt can only have one such strip active at
        any given time, and it can only affix to someone with
        hostile intentions toward him.<br>
        While this Charm is in effect, whenever the character
        takes damage and has at least one mobile hand, a hatchet
        of Essence leaps from his hand to attack the target. It passes
        freely through obstacles and across any distance up to a
        quarter mile, screaming like a bird. There is no roll, and
        the strike can be averted only by perfect dodges and perfect
        parries that are specifically able to block any attack
        Ignoring non-perfect soaks, it inflicts the character's Essence
        in dice of unsoakable lethal damage. For each health
        level the target loses, the Sidereal heals one health level
        - the harsh fate inflicted upon him has been given to
        another. This is a reflexive action and does not count
        against the character's actions for that turn.<br>
        Sometimes, it is harder to stop a terrible journey
        than to embark upon it. The victim of this Charm suffers
        an overpowering, irrational desire to hurt the character.
        Despite the unpleasant consequences of each attack, she
        has difficulty remembering how to stop. Each turn, to
        avoid attacking the Sidereal with the greatest force
        available to her, her player must succeed at a Willpower
        roll. If the victim cannot see or hear the character, the
        effect subsides. She can spend a temporary Willpower to
        free herself from the compulsion until she sees or hears
        the character again.<br>
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Conviction
        with this Charm.
