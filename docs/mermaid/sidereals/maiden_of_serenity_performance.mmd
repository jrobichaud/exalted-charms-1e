        Compassionate Essence Replenishment<br>

        In many ways, Sidereals become the central figures
        in the lives of those around them — unrecognized,
        unknown, but nevertheless, the ones about whom events
        turn. When they call out for it, the world returns the
        love and service they have given it, offering its Essence
        to them freely. This Charm draws on the Exalt's ability
        to move through situations without taking overt action,
        encouraging spirits and the world to willingly take
        the actions she desires. It also draws on the sacrifices she
        makes, that the world should care for her so. Immediately
        after a successful roll using Compassion or
        immediately after a Performance roll that generated a
        significant surge of positive feeling toward the character,
        the Exalt regains twice her Compassion in motes of
        Essence, up to her normal maximum. There is no cost
        to use this Charm's effects - learning this Charm
        simply enhances the Exalt's capabilities.

        Misery fills the world, but it is an incomplete fate.
        Characters with this Charm would sketch a life of sorrow
        as a broken pattern, full of pain, casting forth strands of
        effort, desire, hope and fear that reach for fulfillment.
        Those strands blunt themselves on weakness and circumstance
        but implicitly define the rest of the pattern —
        the perfection that that person's life could be. The Exalt
        can manipulate events to temporarily complete such
        patterns. This is the dance of Venus. His words and
        actions, though apparently mundane, purify and brighten
        the lives around him. The cadence of his movements and
        his speech brings joy to the world. Though not a dance
        by normal definitions, his actions radiate an artistic
        elegance and precision.
        The player rolls Charisma + Performance. For one
        scene, the character and everyone he interacts with gains 1
        temporary Willpower point. This can increase Willpower
        past its normal maximum, but it cannot increase temporary
        Willpower past the number of successes rolled. Beneficiaries
        also feel fulfilled and happy. No character can gain Will-
        power from this Charm more than once per day. Sidereal
        Exalted may always use their Compassion with this Charm.

        Infusing herself with the Essence of the dance, the
        character sees the perfect completion to every enemy
        attack. Matching her efforts to their own, she avoids all
        harm. For the remainder of the scene, the character can
        reflexively dodge any physical attack with her full Dexterity
        + Dodge or Dexterity + Performance dice pool.

        Singing in the language of the Old Realm - which
        she must, of course, know — the character answers the
        deepest fears and questions in a spirit or elemental's
        heart. As with the dance of Venus, she chooses her words
        and melody to complete that which is incomplete. In
        this fashion, she bends the spirit to her ends.
        The Sidereal's player makes a Manipulation + Performance
        roll against the spirit's Essence. It must be able
        to hear the song, although it need not be awake or
        present. On a success, the spirit becomes one of the
        character's allies. Spending experience points equal to
        the spirit's Essence makes this permanent. Otherwise,
        the spirit forgets the Exalt at the end of the story.
        Spirits of fire and wood, embodying life and passion,
        are particularly vulnerable to this technique. Add a +2
        difficulty penalty when entrancing spirits of earth, water
        and air.

        The character closes the loose ends of fate, making a
        ceremony she participates in perfect and complete in the
        eyes of fate and the gods. Betrothals, funerals, banquets
        and other ceremonies all qualify. Her player rolls Charisma
        + Performance (as with a prayer roll, see Exalted,
        pp. 335-336) against a difficulty of (8 - the Resources cost
        of the ceremony). She adds her character's Essence in
        dice. She may lower the target number of this roll. Success
        provides a meaningful bias to fate, particularly in matters
        relevant to her caste. Thus, Chosen of Endings can easily
        arrange a smooth conclusion to a dead man's affairs, and
        the Chosen of Serenity can all but guarantee a couple's
        fertility. Active intervention from antagonists in Heaven
        or creatures outside of fate can muddle the result.

        Every time an audience's trust in the character is
        about to falter, the Exalt adapts her approach to form a
        better answer to its members' needs and desires. The
        player can add dice up to her character's Essence to
        Presence, Performance, Bureaucracy and Socialize rolls.
        This Charm is explicitly permitted to be used in a Combo
        with Charms of other Abilities.
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Compassion
        with this Charm.

        This Charm uses a long prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Dancer. The character binds it around
        her eyes, whereupon it transforms into a band of starmetal
        and blue jade. (It still abides by the normal rules for
        prayer strip destruction.) For the duration of this effect,
        the Exalt is genuinely blind and takes a +2 difficulty
        penalty on appropriate rolls.<br>
        The words of a character employing Harmonic
        Completion sound to others like the affirmations and
        truths they have waited their entire lives to hear. Each
        comes across as a measured antidote to every trouble
        written in their history and fate. The Exalt receives a
        perfect success on all Performance rolls to influence
        mortals. Anyone, mortal or Exalted, who does not deliberately
        tune her out falls in love. Any non-extra character
        can reflexively tune her out when he senses this effect.
        This Charm imposes a difficulty penalty on all rolls to
        attack, dodge or otherwise influence the Sidereal equal
        to her Performance.
