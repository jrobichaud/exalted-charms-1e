        The character infuses her fingernails with Essence,
        hardening them, sharpening them, lengthening them
        into weapons — and, most importantly, causing them to
        bend, influence and predict the path of fate in the
        manner of starmetal. They inflict Strength + 7L damage,
        with +2 to Speed, Accuracy and Defense, and can parry
        both lethal and ranged attacks. Treat attacks and parries
        enhanced with this Charm as unarmed; they are legal
        weapons for any martial arts style.

        The character wraps her body in a sheath of Essence,
        mirroring in its interaction with her own anima
        the link between Solar Exalted and orichalcum. She
        adds (12L/12B) to her soak. This bonus acts as armor in
        all respects save one: It does not interfere with the use of
        any Martial Arts Charm. Thus, attacks that ignore
        armor ignore this soak, while aggravated damage does
        not. The character can invoke this Charm on her initiative.
        She can also invoke it when attacked but must
        declare the use of the Charm before her opponent's
        player makes his attack roll.

        He can make an unarmed Martial Arts attack against
        anyone within (his Essence x 5) yards, and the target
        subtracts his Martial Arts from her dice pools to
        defend against him.

        The character binds the substance of Creation to her
        Essence, shifting into a pattern of attacks that radiates
        the elemental authority of jade. Each gives a gift, which
        applies only to unarmed Martial Arts attacks. Her blows
        can be bashing or lethal, as she chooses, reflecting the
        compassion and conviction of green jade. The grace of
        black jade steers her attacks well: She supplements attack
        rolls with one extra automatic success for every three dice
        rolled, rounded up. The reliability of white jade ensures
        reasonable damage: She supplements damage rolls with
        one extra automatic success for every three dice rolled,
        again rounding up. The force of blue jade knocks opponents
        back one yard for each level of damage inflicted.
        Finally, the swiftness of red jade adds + 3 to her initiative.

        The character attunes herself to the Essence of the

        power, progressive change and elemental stability that
        play out all around her. In this fashion, while she main-
        tains the Form, she becomes a living artifact. This Form
        does not mimic the Essence of soulsteel.<br>
        When using this Form, the character continuously
        receives the benefits of the four stances from which it
        derives. In addition, she becomes unbreakable: She

        and AN and CAl and LI and HUA JI<br>
        The character learns to catch, tangle and throw the
        Essence flows of Charms as if they were the flailing limbs
        of her hapless foes. This is a Martial Arts parry action.
        Therefore, before the character's initiative, she can
        abort to the Charm Redirection Technique. Afterward,
        she can use Martial Arts parry actions (obtained through
        a pre-split dice pool or a Combo with a Charm allowing
        a reflexive Martial Arts parry) for the Charm Redirection
        Technique.<br>
        When someone uses a Charm against her or when
        someone within three yards uses a Charm, the Sidereal's
        player rolls her character's Dexterity + Martial Arts
        against a difficulty equal to the Charm user's Essence.
        The character must invoke the Charm Redirection Tech-
        nique before her opponent's player rolls the Charm's
        effect, if applicable.<br>
        Should the Charm Redirection Technique succeed,
        the Sidereal learns a one-sentence summary of the chosen
        Charm's effects. She can then choose a new target for
        the Charm (if possible) or annul it entirely. The rules for
        annulling Charms are as follows:<br>
        • The target must have the option to not use the
        Charm. (Charms that invoke themselves, such as Surprise
        Anticipation Method, are immune.)<br>
        • The target pays for the Charm normally, but
        nothing happens. For simple or extra action Charms,
        this also means the target cannot act that turn. For
        supplemental Charms, he must take the original dice
        action, unassisted by the Charm.<br>
        • Annulling a reflexive Charm allows the target to
        immediately reuse it. For example, if the character annuls
        Seven Shadow Evasion, the target can reinvoke it
        before the relevant attack resolves.<br>
        The key rules for redirecting Charms are as follows:<br>
        • A redirection is only valid if the original user could
        apply the Charm to the new target. For example, the
        Sidereal can redirect a Solar's Sandstorm- Wind Attack
        against any target within (10 x the Solar's Essence) yards
        of the Solar. The redirection must also make sense. A
        Solar's impassioned words can accidentally seduce the
        wrong target, but Eye-Deceiving Camouflage cannot
        accidentally hide the wrong person.<br>
        • Redirecting the Charm does not change the
        variable effects. Base these on the original user's Traits
        and mote expenditure. For example, a redirected Blazing
        Solar Bolt uses the Solar's Dexterity + Melee pool, not
        the Sidereal's.<br>
        • The victim whose Charm the Sidereal redirected
        pays for the Charm normally. For simple Charms, the
        Charm also represents his action for the turn.<br>
        • Redirecting a supplemental Charm also redirects
        the associated dice action. This uses the original user's
        dice pool.<br>
        • Reflexive Charms cannot be redirected<br>
        • Redirecting extra action Charms redirects all
        possible associated dice actions to the new target. If the
        extra action Charm does not allow the application of
        every roll to a single target — the Arrow Storm Technique
        being an example — the character chooses as
        many actions to redirect as possible, and any remaining
        actions proceed normally.<br>
        This Charm does not work against Charms established
        in previous turns or against Combos. It does not
        work against Martial Arts Form-type Charms or sorcery-they
        cannot be redirected or annulled.

        Sequential Charm Disruption (CAJ)<br>

        Minimum Essence: 4<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Charm Redirection Technique<br>
        <br>
        This Charm extends the Charm Redirection Technique,
        allowing the character to:
        • Annul the effects of established Charms. For
        example, she can cancel an ongoing Flow Like
        Blood Charm.<br>
        • Annul or redirect a Combo. This follows simple
        rules: If the Exalt can legally redirect all the simple,
        supplemental and extra action Charms in a Combo, she
        can do so, as a single invocation of Sequential Charm
        Disruption. If she can legally annul all of them, she can
        do so, again with a single invocation. She chooses
        whether to annul or ignore the reflexive Charms in a
        Combo individually, as they are used.
        To use Sequential Charm Disruption, the character
        must be a target of the Charm or effect or the character
        must come within three yards of the Charm's original
        user. She then uses a Martial Arts parry action against
        the Charm itself, her player rolling Dexterity + Martial
        Arts against the Charm user's Essence. When disrupting
        Combos, if applicable, the Sidereal must invoke Sequential
        Charm Disruption before her opponent begins rolling
        the Charms' effects.<br>
        Like Charm Redirection Technique, this Charm
        does not affect Form-type Charms or Sorcery. The Es-
        sence cost for this Charm equals the Essence cost for all
        the Charms affected, plus 5 motes.<br>
        For Example: Swan's Combo, as described on page 215
        of Exalted, includes Striking Serpent Speed, Crippling Pres-
        sure-Point Strike, Serpentine Evasion and Thunderbolt At-
        tack Prana. Nerys wishes to thwart Swan and his associate
        Imri using Sequential Charm Disruption. The Sidereal splits
        her dice pool and attacks him. Swan invokes Serpentine
        Evasion, declaring the Combo and spending 1 Willpower.
        Nerys ignores this Charm, and Swan successfully evades.
        Then, Swan attacks. He spends 4 motes and 1 Willpower on
        Striking Serpent Speed, his player rolling the Eclipse's Essence
        and discovering that he can make three attacks that
        turn. Each attack costs 6 motes and 1 Willpower, for a total
        cost of 22 motes of Essence and 4 Willpower. Nerys uses her
        second action to parry and disrupt the Combo, with a
        difficulty equal to Swan's Essence. This costs 27 motes and
        1 Willpower. She cannot redirect Swan's actions to different
        targets because of the rules for redirecting extra action Charms.
        However, if Imri happens to be standing near Swan, Nerys
        can legally redirect all of these Charms at her. Swan shrinks
        into a tight crouch, then explodes upward in a leap, blazing
        with golden Essence. Nerys catches and twists the power
        radiating from Swan. Instead of enabling a terrifying assault
        against Nerys, the energy flow from Swan's Combo draws
        him, with absolute grace and helpless beauty, into a series of
        three fierce attacks upon Imri. Each blow casts off spherical
        shockwaves of white energy, and not until all three land can
        Swan wrench himself free from the tangled Essence flow.

        The character uses martial arts to yank the threads
        of a delicate construct of sorcery out of place. Upon
        contact with the effects of sorcery, she activates this
        Charm and makes a reflexive unarmed Martial Arts
        attack against the structure of the spell. The difficulty
        equals the sorcerer's Essence plus the spell's circle. If she
        succeeds, the spell shatters, as if dispelled by countermagic
        of its own circle.<br>
        The Exalt can work an even greater mischief if
        someone actually casts a spell within her reach. Her
        player makes an unarmed Martial Arts attack roll as
        described above. If she succeeds, the Sidereal can abort
        the spell as above. Alternately, she can cause the entire
        structure to unravel as if the sorcerer had botched a
        distraction roll (see Exalted, pp. 216-217).<br>
        This Charm functions against necromancy as well
        as sorcery, but only if the Sidereal Exalted has had
        extensive opportunity to study the dark magics of the
        Abyssal Exalted.

        The character uses her education in the nature of
        fate in conjunction with her martial skill to disjoint,
        snarl and otherwise tangle the fates the spiders weave.
        By lightly striking the target in the five points where the
        threads of the Loom of Fate attach, the Sidereal can
        negate the effects of Sidereal astrology. Upon contact
        with a Sidereal astrological effect, she may activate this
        Charm and make a reflexive unarmed Martial Arts
        attack against the threads of destiny. The difficulty
        equals the Essence + College of the Sidereal who
        created the effect. If she succeeds, the effect is dangerously
        torn or frayed, and the pattern spiders abandon it.
        This causes • Paradox to both the martial artist attack-
        ing the effect and the Sidereal who created it and may
        trigger an inquiry by the bureau.<br>
        This Charm can target resplendent destinies, even
        ones lurking in the target's background. If the target has
        multiple effects active at once, the martial artist will
        have to attack them each separately. Roll first for any
        active resplendent destiny, then any other effects, highest
        Essence + College first.

        While using the Soul Fire Shaper Form, the character

        its natural spirit with his Essence manipulations
        as easily as a master of legerdemain might steal a mortal's
        coat. The Sidereal's player rolls Charisma + Martial Arts
        against a difficulty equal to the Essence of the Exalt's
        target — the body he wants to steal or the god or least god
        of the thing he wishes to possess. The target's player can
        make a simple Willpower roll against difficulty 2 each
        turn to regain control over her body. In the meantime,
        the Exalt's body dematerializes. He can move and take
        Martial Arts actions through the stolen flesh, using the
        body's Strength, Dexterity or Stamina if they exceed his

        Cost: 7 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Martial Arts: 5<br>
        Minimum Essence: 5<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: One complete martial art (all Charms), God Ways, one Exalt Ways Charm<br>
        <br>
        and WU JI<br>
        The character adopts the attitude and posture of the
        spirit courts, moving with the infinite baroque complexity
        necessary to the management of Creation. Directed
        by the four powers of her mind — aspiration, effort,
        intention and analysis — the whole of her Essence flows
        as one. Simultaneously, even the smallest mote of her
        being directs itself toward managing its own affairs.
        Though no imperfect creature can truly master it,
        this Form has a perfect beauty to it. While the character
        uses this Form, enemies' players must fail a Compassion
        roll if these enemies wish to harm her. Subduing her or
        manipulating her remains acceptable. Enemies cannot
        spend Willpower for the roll to deliberately fail. Those
        who witness the Games of Divinity Form become addicted:
        So long as they remember the Sidereal or the
        Form, they crave to see it again. Their players must
        succeed at Temperance rolls for their characters to refuse
        any reasonable opportunity to behold, once again, the
        Games of Divinity Form.<br>
        Dreamstones (see p. 18) provide a more intense
        experience than this Form. Dreamstone addiction both
        wipes away and prevents addiction to the Form. However,
        witnessing or performing the Games of Divinity
        Form is an unpleasant but palatable dreamstone alternative
        for even the most desperate of addicts.<br>
        Characters cannot normally use more than one
        Martial Arts Form-type Charm at a time.

        Demesne Emulation Practice (KAO)<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 20 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Martial Arts: 5<br>

        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        and KAO<br>
        Tugging gently on the flows of Essence around him,
        the character forms himself into a nexus, a convergence
        point through which power pours. The Sidereal's player
        rolls Dexterity + Martial Arts, unmodified by any other
        Charms. For the remainder of the scene, each of the
        Exalt's successful unarmed attacks also does aggravated
        damage equal to the number of successes rolled for the
        Demesne Emulation Practice Charm. This damage is
        soaked separately. The Sidereal's hand upon an enemy's
        chest burns her with raw Essence, his elbow in her ear
        fills her head with Essence lightning, and his foot against
        her knee is as terribly cold as the Essence of a saltwater
        siren's heart.

        Demesne and Manse Form (CHUNG TING)<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 12 motes<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Martial Arts: 5<br>
        Minimum Essence: 5<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: One complete martial art (all Charms), Demesne Emulation Practice<br>
        <br>
        and CHUNG TING!<br>
        The character adopts the stately grandeur of a temple
        and radiates the ancient power of a Manse. She can now
        properly channel and constrain the raw Essence flow
        that the Demesne Emulation Practice feeds into her,
        coalescing it around her Caste Mark into a Hearthstone
        set in her brow. This Hearthstone only exists while the
        character is using Demesne and Manse Form. When the
        Sidereal terminates the Form, the Hearthstone fades.<br>
        When using the Form, the character receives the
        Hearthstone's benefits, as if it were properly set in a
        starmetal circlet. The player and the Storyteller should
        work together to determine its effects, developing a 4- or
        5-dot Hearthstone that reflects the character's personal-
        ity. Treat major changes to the character's nature as
        architectural alterations to a Manse, adjusting the
        Hearthstone's abilities appropriately.<br>
        Characters cannot normally use more than one
        Martial Arts Form-type Charm at a time.

        Prismatic Arrangement of Creation (TAO)<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Martial Arts: 5<br>
        Minimum Essence: 5<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Four Magical Materials Form, Soul Fire Shaper Form, Games of Divinity Form, Demesne and Manse Form<br>
        <br>
        The Elder Sutra of Essence: The last maiden's name was
        TAO. These were their names, but they knew them not.
        As she assumes this Form, the character vanishes
        into the flows of Essence around her. For a long moment,
        she is nowhere and everywhere, embodied in the dance
        of all things. Then, she manifests again, in every move-
        ment consummately aware of everything around her,
        reacting to intentions before they are formed, actions
        before they are taken and to the battle as a whole as easily
        as to a single blow.<br>
        This Charm doubles the character's base initiative
        (Dexterity + Wits). Charms such as Opportune Shot and
        Thunderclap Rush Attack do not automatically win
        initiative over her. The Exalt is aware of every attack
        against her and is immune to sensory penalties — this is
        a perfect effect. She can sense every effect, object and
        creature within (her Essence x 10) yards. Noticing something
        hidden requires a reflexive Perception + Awareness
        roll, adding the Sidereal's Essence in automatic successes.<br>
        While using the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation
        Form, the character can also invoke any or all of its
        subsidiary Forms, paying the normal Essence cost. As
        long as the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form is
        active, the Four Magical Materials Form, Soul Fire Shaper
        Form, Games of Divinity Form and Demesne and Manse
        Form can coexist with it and with one another. The
        character can also invoke other Form-type Charms, but
        this limits her to a total of two other Forms. For example,
        she could invoke Prismatic Arrangement of Creation
        Form followed by either Earth Dragon Form and Games
        of Divinity Form, Tiger Form and Ebon Shadow Form or
        Snake Form and Charcoal March of Spiders Form. The
        Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form is transcendent
        and embraces other Forms as lesser parts of itself.<br>
        While this Form is active, the character may have
        access to unexpected weaponry. Any weapon treated as
        an unarmed attack by a style whose Form-type Charm
        she has active is treated as an unarmed attack for the
        purpose of all Martial Arts Charms. This is a specific
        benefit of the Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form
        and not a general rule. For example, Tiger Form allows
        the use of tiger claws as unarmed attacks. If she has both
        Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form and Tiger
        Form active, the Sidereal can use tiger claws to inflict the
        Water Spider Bite - whether or not she also has Char-
        coal March of Spiders Form active. This effect does not
        extend to armor.<br>
        The Prismatic Arrangement of Creation Form is
        complete and perfect in every respect, but to perform it
        correctly requires a deep understanding of the other
        styles that it subsumes. Sidereal masters estimate that a
        complete understanding of roughly 40 styles would allow
        an essentially accurate adoption of this Form, possibly
        increasing the power of this Charm.
