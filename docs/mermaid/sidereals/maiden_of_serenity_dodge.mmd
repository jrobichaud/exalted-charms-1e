        Predicting the path of a blade or blow well in
        advance, the Exalted arranges to be somewhere else
        when it lands. He can reduce the target number of a
        Dexterity + Dodge roll.

        Cost: 10 motes<br>

        Type: Reflexive<br>

        <br>
        The character sees impending danger rippling toward
        her in the skein of fate and, as with Absence,
        chooses not to meet it. Her player rolls Dexterity +
        Dodge against a difficulty equal to her opponent's Essence.
        If the roll succeeds, the Exalt avoids any undesirable
        effect, including attacks she is not aware of, attacks with
        an area of effect, attacks with no physical component
        such as the Irresistible Questioning Technique and continuous
        deleterious effects such as You and Yours Stance.
        She must Duck Fate before her opponent's player makes
        the attack roll or as soon as her player knows about the
        effect, whichever is applicable. She need evade a continuous
        effect only once.

        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>

        Sometimes, the best answer to trouble is not being
        there at all. In the first two turns of combat or the first
        minute of a social encounter, the Sidereal's player can
        declare, &quot;I'm not there.&quot; It turns out — at least as far as
        anyone can prove — that the Exalt anticipated the
        situation prophetically and was somewhere else, of the
        Storyteller's choosing, all along.<br>
        For this Charm's purposes, the first minute of a social
        encounter begins at the last chance the Exalt had to
        conveniently leave. If the character is chatting with a
        friend and Lilith shows up, a new social encounter has
        begun. The Sidereal can use this Charm, retroactively
        making her excuses and ducking out sometime before-
        hand. If the character is chatting with Lilith and a friend
        shows up, however, she's still in the encounter with Lilith.

        Trouble Reduction Strategy<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Generous Sidereals learn to spot impending danger
        to others as well. When activating this Charm, the
        character chooses a number of targets whose total Essence
        does not exceed her own. While the Trouble
        Reduction Strategy is in force, the character can use any
        other Dodge Charm she knows to benefit a consenting
        target instead of herself. Simple and extra action Charms
        use the character's action and Dodge pool. Reflexive
        Charms use the character's Dodge pool. Supplemental
        Charms enhance the target's dice action.<br>
        Using a Charm on someone else's behalf counts as
        using that Charm that turn. The Exalt must pay for the
        Charm. She can only use other Charms that turn if she
        declares an appropriate Combo when using her first
        Charm. If the Combo includes non-reflexive Charms
        from other Abilities, the character cannot use it with the
        Trouble Reduction Strategy. If it includes reflexive
        Charms from other Abilities, she cannot use them on the
        target's behalf. She could, for example, Combo Absence
        and Shield of Mars (see p. 163). When she invoked the
        Combo, she could use Absence but not Shield of Mars to
        protect a friend. She must take a dodge action that turn,
        assisted by Absence, even if no one tries to hit her,
        because it is a supplemental Charm in a Combo. She can
        reflexively invoke the Shield of Mars.<br>
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Compassion
        with this Charm.

        This Charm uses a long prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Hunted Maiden. The character twists it
        and wraps it around her waist, whereupon it transforms
        into a band of crystalline Essence the color of the sky. Each
        hour the Exalted leaves this Charm in force, the band
        tightens, doing two levels of unsoakable bashing damage.
        This damage cannot be healed until the Charm ends.
        The character begins to walk or run. These are the
        only acceptable forms of motion, but she can enhance
        them with Charms or the Lesser Sign of Mercury. As the
        character travels, the weave of Creation shifts, dragging
        part of the world after her. Specifically, both the general
        terrain and all habitations within her Essence in miles
        move with her. In the planning rooms of fate, this Charm
        slowly changes the records of each transported thing's
        position. Thus, their fated interactions in the moments
        to come take place in a new location.
        This Charm alters divine records, which are then
        interpreted by those who feed fate into the world.
        Accordingly, it is an intelligent effect. The Sidereal
        cannot shear a mountain or city in two. If the Charm
        cannot logically divide such features, given the radius
        of effect, they do not travel at all. Further, Creation fills
        in the &quot;vacant space&quot; with something reasonable. Finally,
        the Sidereal cannot &quot;erase&quot; anything important
        by dragging land onto it. If she drags a desert onto a
        Manse in a forested region, the forest retreats but does
        not vanish. The Manse follows the forest or relocates to
        the desert. The new location seems correct and reasonable
        to all witnesses, although they remember the
        previous state of affairs.<br>
        This Charm was first used to pull a key fortification
        out of the way of a Primordial assault, in the days when
        Exalted and Primordials warred. Using this Charm with-
        out authorization is a Severity 3 offense.
