        Smooth Transition<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 2 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Medicine: 2<br>
        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        This Charm speeds and ensures a smooth transition
        from life to death. It instantly and painlessly kills any
        Incapacitated or dying target. The target cannot rise
        again as an undead. If applied to a corpse, neither the
        body nor spirit can rise again as an undead. Zombies
        instantly collapse. This power cannot target ghosts di-
        rectly, but if applied to the ghost's original body — not a
        body it happens to possess - it banishes the ghost
        instantly and permanently to the Underworld.<br>
        No Charm or ability protects the victim against
        Smooth Transition or activates in the moment of death.
        This is a perfect effect. However, extremely unusual
        corpses — such as spine chains — require a Charisma +
        Medicine roll to lay to rest, with difficulty equal to the
        Essence of the creature that raised them.<br>
        If the body of a target of this Charm is ever placed on
        naked earth or stone, it sinks quietly beneath the surface,
        arranging for its own burial.<br>
        Sidereal Exalted may always use their Valor with
        this Charm.

        Peaceful Conclusion<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 2 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        As with Smooth Transition, this Charm instantly,
        painlessly and perfectly kills its target. The target need not
        be dying, Incapacitated or even wounded but must be
        willing to pass into death. His consent cannot be forced, nor
        can it be forcibly withheld: The target dies if and only if he
        would decide to consent, given adequate time and comfort
        in which to think, while under the influence of neither drug
        nor Charm. The Sidereal Exalted can freely make the
        prospect of life as unpleasant as she desires. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Valor with this Charm.

        Invocation of the Storm-Following Silence<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Smooth Transition<br>
        <br>
        The character casts forth the violet radiance of
        Endings, stillness coming to the weave of fate. He brings
        a Smooth Transition to all those within (his Essence x
        10) yards. If facing unusual corpses, his player makes only
        a single Charisma + Medicine roll; compare the number
        of successes received to the Essence of the Deathlord or
        deathknight who raised each given corpse to determine
        whether it falls. Sidereal Exalted may always use their
        Valor with this Charm.

        Terminate Illness<br>

        Cost: 10 motes<br>

        <br>
        The character makes the Inferior Sign of the Corpse
        against the spirit of an illness, and it comes to its natural
        end. The Exalt's player makes an Intelligence + Medicine
        roll against the normal difficulty to treat the disease,
        adding her Essence in dice. If successful, the disease's
        course ends, the least god of the infection dies peacefully,
        and the target can begin recovery. This does not affect
        spiritual diseases (see pp. 195-201). Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Conviction with this Charm.

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Maiden and the Road. The character
        buries it seven yards beneath the ground and covers its
        grave with stone. Ten spines of indigo light burst upward
        from the grave and explode into the sky - the Charm
        then takes effect. The Sidereal's intuition for fate leads
        her to the nearest spirit or elemental of the earth or the
        air who stands, for whatever reason, on the verge of
        death. If the Sidereal so chooses, she may offer it an
        opportunity to endure past its time. If it accepts, it binds
        itself to the Sidereal Exalted's soul and vanishes.<br>
        Until the Sidereal releases this Charm and the
        committed Essence, she recovers one lethal or bashing
        health level per turn. This action is a reflexive one that
        does not count against her actions for the turn. If she
        binds an earth entity rather than a creature of air, this
        regeneration functions only in contact with the earth or
        stone. In addition, her natural soak increases by (3L/3B)
        if she binds an air creature and (6L/6B) if she ties herself
        to the earth. This soak is not compatible with armor. The
        character does not choose which sort of elemental or
        spirit she finds. The matter is in Saturn's hands.<br>
        The character can transfer the bound spirit or elemental
        to another. From that point forward, that person
        benefits from the effects, and she does not. She cannot
        reclaim it once so transferred, although the Charm still
        ends when she stops committing Essence to it.<br>
        When the character ends the Charm, the elemental
        or spirit is born again from its host's soul. It does not
        return as quite the same entity and is often closer to the
        Exalt's strength than to its original power. It may or may
        not consider itself indebted, depending on its nature,
        how long the character left the Charm in force and
        whether the Sidereal had anything to do with its being
        on the verge of death in the first place.
