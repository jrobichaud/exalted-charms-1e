        <br>
        The character chooses the arc of his blow and writes
        it into forthcoming fate. One attack made using Brawl
        cannot be blocked. If it hits, the target's armor provides
        no protection.

        Cost: 3 motes + 1 mote per die<br>

        <br>
        The character adapts to the conditions of the battlefield,
        rewriting the course of events so that they aid
        rather than hinder her. She makes a Brawl attack,
        suffering no environmental or circumstantial penalties
        and adding up to her Essence in dice. Sidereal Exalted
        may always use their Compassion with this Charm.

        Horrific Wreath<br>

        Cost: 2 motes<br>
        Duration: Five turns<br>

        The character mirrors her personal Essence to that
        of her enemies. When she strikes at a demon, this Charm
        wreathes her fists in a hideous red glare. When she
        attacks the servants of the Malfeans, her hands burn an
        undifferentiated white. Herunarmed attacks and attacks
        using starmetal brawling aids do lethal damage against
        ordinary foes and aggravated damage against inhabitants
        of Malfeas and the Underworld. This Charm can be
        invoked during a clinch, and its effects apply to a
        character's clinching damage. Its effects also apply to
        barehanded Martial Arts attacks.

        Crimson Palm Counterstrike<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>
        Minimum Brawl: 4<br>
        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Horrific Wreath<br>
        <br>
        Coming to an accommodation with an enemy's
        movements, the character learns to interrupt an enemy's
        strike an instant before it happens. If the character is
        aware of an incoming hand-to-hand attack, she can
        reflexively counterattack. A well-executed Crimson
        Palm Counterstrike knocks the enemy out of position:
        He overreaches or stumbles and cannot complete his
        attack. The Sidereal's player makes a single Dexterity
        + Brawl roll at her full dice pool. Count the
        number of successes. Apply these successes first as a
        parry, even against a lethal attack, to resolve the initial
        blow. Then, apply the remainder as successes received
        on an immediate Brawl counterattack.<br>
        The character can only use this Charm if she's able
        to attack and cannot use it in response to Crimson Palm
        Counterstrike or other any counterattack Charm. Otherwise,
        the parry and counterattack succeed or fail
        independently - she can knock her opponent aside
        without damaging him, or vice versa.

        Easily-Accepted Proposition Stance<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 12 motes, 1 Willpower, 1 health level<br>
        Duration: One battle<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Brawl: 5<br>

        This Charm uses a prayer strip marked with the
        scripture of the Drowning Maiden. The character knots
        it into her shadow, where it shimmers a soft scarlet.
        Once per invocation of this Charm, the character
        can strike a fate-resolving blow, sending cascading vibrations
        through the weave of the world. She dictates a
        single event or circumstance. The dictum must be a
        feasible occurrence, although it can be highly improb-
        able: Reinforcements might arrive, a wall might
        spontaneously crumble, or the character's fallen army
        might turn out to be bruised and unconscious rather than
        wounded and dead. Legions of tyrant lizards cannot fall
        from the sky and set upon the foe.<br>
        The Exalt's player rolls Intelligence + Brawl. The
        difficulty is the Essence of the highest-Essence entity
        directly and unpleasantly affected by the character's
        dictum. If she succeeds, that enemy has a choice. Either
        the character's dictum comes to pass, or the tremors in
        the weave ground through that enemy â€” inflicting dice
        of aggravated damage equal to the Sidereal's Essence,
        plus one die per extra success on the Brawl roll. This
        damage ignores armor. The attempted use of a defensive
        Charm nullifies the damage entirely; instead, the
        dictum takes effect.<br>
        Sidereal Exalted can always use their Valor with this
        Charm. Using this Charm without authorization is a
        Severity 3 offense.
