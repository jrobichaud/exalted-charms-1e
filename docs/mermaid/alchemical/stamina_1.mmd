        Through the implantation of armored plates, reinforcing
        struts and redundant parts, the Alchemical is made more
        resistant to damage. When the Exalt takes this Charm, he
        may choose to permanently gain either two - 1 health levels
        or three -2 health levels. The choice can be made each time
        the Charm is taken and cannot be changed without reinstallation
        of the Charm. The Alchemical may take this Charm
        as many times as he has points of permanent Essence.
        This Charm is the Alchemical equivalent of Ox-Body
        Technique. If members of the Eclipse Caste take it, it counts
        against their Endurance as if they had taken Ox-Body
        Technique. The Strain Resistant Chassis Modification is
        obvious when applied to an Exalt â€” his joints and vitals are
        clearly armored, and his frame is square and powerful.
