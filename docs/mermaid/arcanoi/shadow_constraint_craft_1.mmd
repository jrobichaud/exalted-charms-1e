        Throughout the Underworld, subtle laws apply to the
        activities of ghosts. Most such laws stem from the use of
        ancient and wide-ranging necromancy, but others are
        restricted in their area of effect, are new or have nothing
        to do with necromancy itself — they are inherent to the
        fabric of the Underworld. Ghosts can create temporary
        taboos with the Impose Stricture Arcanos (see p. 45).
        Illuminate the Shadow Constraint reveals any taboos
        that apply to any locations within sight. Alternately, the
        ghost’s player may roll Perception + Bureaucracy when her
        character uses this Charm in order to determine any taboos
        that apply to a particular person or ghost. Studious and
        careful ghosts learn Illuminate the Shadow Constraint in
        order to remain aware of taboos and strange laws of reality
        as they travel from realm to realm.<br>

        TWENTY TABOOS<br>
        The Storyteller may use any of these as local taboos, while players may choose to create them with
        necromancy or some of the Arcanoi in this art. This list should be seen only as inspiration. These are not the only
        possible taboos by any means.<br>

        instantly notices the presence of any active necromantic
        effects within his field of vision, so long as his player
        succeeds in a simple Perception + Occult roll. Ensorcelled
        people, objects or areas emit a dark, pulsing aura to the
        character’s eyes for a moment or two. With three or more
        successes, the ghost is aware of the circle (Shadowlands,
        Underworld, Void) of the necromancy, and with five or
        more successes, he learns a one-word description of what
        every effect in the area is doing.

        This simple Charm allows a ghost to detect the
        presence of criminals against the local natural order. It
        immediately points out any living being in line of sight
        within the Underworld (even if he attempts to conceal his
        presence through non-magical disguises or the like). Additionally,
        with a Perception + Bureaucracy roll at standard
        difficulty, the ghost-magistrate notices any entity that has
        violated a taboo of the Underworld within the last 24
        hours and not had his violation forgiven through the use
        of Accept Amercement.

        Brief Exemption allows a ghost to tiptoe around a
        taboo of the Underworld, whether it is a “natural” taboo,
        one imposed by necromancy or one created by Impose
        Stricture (see p. 45). A Manipulation + Stealth roll is
        required. An “ordinary” natural taboo requires just one
        success to ignore. One imposed by Necromancy or Impose
        Stricture requires a number of successes equal to the
        Essence of the entity who created the taboo (a default of
        four if unknown).

        Accept Amercement allows a learned ghost to forgive
        another’s trespass of local taboo. The violator does not
        have to be truly repentant; the Charm simply eliminates
        the negative effect of the taboo for the scene. If the taboo
        act is a simple, instant thing — eating pomegranates, for
        instance — this Charm “erases” the act, and the target of
        the Charm will suffer no further ill effects from his past
        violation. If the taboo is a state of being — for instance,
        wearing shoes when it is forbidden to do so — the Arcanos
        allows the target to continue to violate the taboo for the
        duration of a single scene.

        The intensity of punishment for violating a taboo varies
        wildly. This Arcanos allows a ghostly magistrate to add his
        own penalty to a violation. This additional punishment can
        take one of several forms, at the magistrate’s discretion:<br>
        • -2 dice to all dice pools<br>
        • A visible or audible sign that the violator is a
        criminal (such as a brand or a phantom crow that shouts
        “Violator!” from the character’s shoulder)<br>
        • All forms of movement reduced by 1/3 due to some
        visible impediment<br>
        Similarly scaled punishments may also be levied, at
        the Storyteller’s discretion. All such effects last until the
        end of the scene in which Levy Fine is invoked but require
        no dice roll to impose so long as the target of the Charm has
        violated a local taboo. No punishment can be used if the
        target has not violated a local taboo. This Charm may be
        applied multiple times to a single target, but only if he has
        violated multiple laws of the Underworld.

        world or a shadowland until such time as he is forgiven for
        his transgression. This forgiveness can only come from
        the use of Accept Amercement (above) by a ghost with
        equal to or higher Essence than the ghost who uses this
        Arcanos. This Arcanos has no effect on ghosts, nor even
        on Ghost-Blooded.

        Hide the Living Name turns a living transgressor into
        a ghost for all intents and purposes until his crime is
        forgiven by a ghostly magistrate with equal or higher
        Essence than the user of this Arcanos. The Charm strips
        away the subject’s physical form and life-essence, impris-
        oning it in an unknown location (many suspect the
        Labyrinth — which might have dire consequences in the
        long run, see below). What’s left, the target’s higher soul
        (or hun), persists as any other ghost might. The subject of
        the Charm can leave the Underworld through a shadowland
        and even enter Creation, but no matter where he goes, he
        remains a ghost (and is incorporeal in Creation, etc.). His
        physical body does, apparently, age — a few centuries ago,
        in a rare case, a mortal was stricken to ghosthood by a
        vengeful magistrate and left in that state for several years.
        When he returned to a living state, he found that his hair
        had grayed and that lines had crept across his face.<br>
        Living targets of this Charm with particularly high
        scores in any Virtue and low Willpower may find that their
        bodies become possessed by spectres while they are under
        the influence of this Arcanos. Spectres are attracted to the
        bodies of the particularly virtuous (regardless of the Vir-
        tue), but are repelled by the leftover Willpower that
        anchors the living body’s mind. If the sum of the character’s
        two highest Virtues exceed his Willpower, that character’s
        body is a potential possession target. A possessing spectre
        takes a living body back into Creation and wreaks havoc
        as it sees fit. It cannot read the victim’s mind, so it cannot
        necessarily destroy the character’s life, but it can certainly
        break laws and cause trouble no matter where it goes. If a
        possessed body is killed in Creation, it returns to the
        Labyrinth and slowly regenerates, and the spectre that
        took it to Creation is ejected.<br>
        If the character’s body is possessed at the time that his
        sentence ends, he cannot return to it until the spectre
        residing in it is somehow ejected. It is the Storyteller’s call
        as to whether the target’s body has been possessed at all and
        particularly whether the body is “out” at the time that the
        target is ready to return to it.

        The ghost using Impose Stricture can create a short-
        term taboo in his local area — within one mile per point
        of permanent Essence (or the size of a small village). This
        taboo should be relatively simple — nearly all taboos
        either preclude a single simple behavior (such as eating
        pomegranates) or require a single behavior (such as wear-
        ing a particular garment at all times). No taboo can be
        impossible to adhere to — even taboos that are logical
        impossibilities (“Everyone in this area must be male and
        female at the same time”) has to have a possible symbolic
        solution (ritual transvestitism, for instance). Taboos created
        by Impose Stricture only apply within the Underworld.
        Impose Stricture implies only a single, relatively minor
        penalty — violators of a taboo suffer a one-die penalty to
        all dice pools until one hour past the time that they stop
        violating the taboo. That is, if the taboo is a single action,
        violators suffer a one-hour penalty. If it is a continuous
        action (“Wear no leather”), the penalty applies as long as
        the criminal violates the taboo and then an additional
        hour after that. The one-hour duration can be cut short if
        the violator receives the use of Accept Amercement by a
        ghost magistrate.

        A magistrate-ghost uses Curse of the Damned to
        apply a permanent taboo to another being — be it a spirit,
        a ghost or a living being. The target of this Arcanos must
        have an Essence lower than the ghost using it, and it is
        difficult to apply — the ghost’s player makes a Manipulation
        + Lore roll, while the target’s player resists with
        Willpower. If the ghost achieves more successes, the
        target suffers from a taboo for the rest of its existence. As
        with Impose Stricture, above, violation of the taboo
        results in a one-die penalty to all dice pools for at least
        one hour after the violation. The taboo should be straightforward,
        as described in Impose Stricture (with examples
        given in the boxed text on p. 43). The Curse of the
        Damned can be removed if the ghost who inflicted it uses
        Accept Amercement or if any other entity with an
        Essence higher than the ghostly magistrate who invoked
        the taboo uses Accept Amercement.
