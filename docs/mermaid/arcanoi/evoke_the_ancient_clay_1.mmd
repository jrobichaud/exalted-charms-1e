        This Charm allows a ghost’s whispered voice to be
        heard in the portion of the living world that corresponds
        to his location in the Underworld. The ghost must literally
        whisper as he uses this ability — if he speaks at normal
        volume, those near him in the lands of the dead hear him
        normally, but those in the living world do not. The ghost’s
        whispers can be heard clearly within one yard of his
        location. A successful Perception + Awareness roll must
        be made for those within 10 yards to hear the whispers, and
        an additional success must be achieved for every 10 yards
        distance for anyone further away.

        Marsh Light allows a ghost to create a light or a small
        group of lights in the living world in the spot correspond-
        ing to her current location in the Underworld. The light
        or lights must form simple shapes and can only move with
        the ghost.<br>
        The lights often pique the curiosity of the living.
        Players of living creatures who see the lights and aren’t
        actively engaged in something they consider to be important
        (combat, critical craftwork, healing a friend, etc.)
        must make a successful Conviction roll for their characters,
        or they spend a turn considering the lights. Living
        creatures or spirits with an Essence higher than the ghost’s
        are immune to this effect.

        <br>
        Sweet Winsome Light creates a beautiful bobbing
        light that attracts all who see it. Ghosts use this Arcanos
        to lure their prey — or their enemies — to their doom. The
        light dances in the wind, eternally just five or ten yards out
        of reach, and it appears to be a traveler’s torch or a glowing
        talisman. The Sweet Winsome Light can be created within
        20 yards of the ghost’s current location or (for an additional
        mote of Essence) at the spot in Creation
        corresponding to the ghost’s current location in the Underworld.
        To create the light, the ghost’s player rolls
        Charisma + Occult, and it lasts for one minute per success.<br>
        The light attracts all who see it. Animals that notice
        it automatically move toward it (though they don’t charge
        with all their will — their handlers or riders may resist the
        Arcanos with standard Ride feats if they can keep their
        own heads about them). Living beings (even Exalted)
        resist the Sweet Winsome Light with a Conviction roll.
        For each turn that the light is visible, the target’s player
        must get at least one success on the Conviction roll, or the
        target moves toward it at his best possible speed. A spent
        point of Willpower negates the effect of the Sweet Winsome
        Light for a full minute.

        A ghost using Tinker’s Body can assemble a patch-
        work body for himself in the living world out of nearby
        scraps, trash and trinkets. The ghost remains intangible
        but is able to motivate the collection of objects and feel
        through the Tinker’s Body as though it was his own flesh
        and blood — at least to some extent. The ghost cannot
        speak through the Tinker’s Body, though he can clap,
        stomp and make similar gross-motor sorts of sounds. The
        ghost loses two dice from all Social dice pools while
        “wearing” the Tinker’s Body — a penalty that may be
        reduced if the ghost’s player succeeds in an appropriate
        Craft roll for his character to fabricate a suitably expressive
        face. The ghost’s Mental Attributes are unchanged in the
        Tinker’s Body, while his Physical Attributes depend on
        the composition of the body.<br>
        The Tinker’s Body gets one dot in each of the three
        Physical Attributes, and the ghost gets an additional four
        dots to be split between the Physical Attributes based on the
        objects out of which he constructs the Tinker’s Body — a
        Tinker’s Body made of twine and straw may have a Dexterity
        of ••••• and Strength and Stamina of • each, while one
        made of loose brick and stone may have a Dexterity of • and
        Strength and Stamina of ••• each. The Tinker’s Body is
        only a shell; it has four health levels (-0/-1/-2/-4). Wound
        penalties represent bits of the body being knocked off or
        otherwise destroyed, rather than pain and shock.

        Sleeper’s Caul enables a ghost to make a static solid
        body in the land of the living. This body is not truly the
        ghost’s own body; it is a shell, and even if it is destroyed, the
        ghost remains unharmed. The Sleeper’s Caul has a Strength
        and Dexterity of 0; it cannot move. Its Stamina is equal to
        the ghost’s Stamina. The Sleeper’s Caul can hear, speak
        and see (even blink and move its eyes). The ghost has a
        sense of touch, even if it cannot move, so it does feel pain.
        The Sleeper’s Caul has three health levels (no wound
        penalties apply, since the body can never perform actions).

        Embody allows a ghost who is disembodied in the
        material world to create himself a temporary body out of
        Essence. This body takes the ghost’s likeness (which may
        not be exactly the same as his appearance in life!). The
        meat-body that the ghost pulls together with Embody is
        not a fully functional body by comparison to the ghost’s
        normal abilities in the Underworld, a shadowland or
        during Calibration. The ghost has its normal Intelligence,
        Wits and Social Attributes while in this temporary body,
        but as an improvised bag of flesh, its other Attributes are
        all reduced by two dots (to minimum of •). The meat-body
        has four health levels (-0/-1/-2/-4), and the ghost really
        does feel the pain of any wounds it takes — and it is
        obviously not well suited for combat.

        This Arcanos allows a ghost to bring a single ghost
        animal into a manifest form when he manifests. He must
        be touching the animal to do so. The animal retains all of

        animals of its species will recognize it to be strange and shy
        away from it. The ghost animal returns to incorporeal

        Birth the Warrior Form allows the ghost to use his
        Essence and Willpower to create a body that is prepared for
        combat — the ghost also creates temporary armor and
        weapons that manifest in the living world. The player
        should roll Valor + Occult to create the body, and for each
        success, the Warrior Form lasts for five minutes. This body
        takes the ghost’s likeness and has his full Attributes. The
        Warrior Form also has the ghost’s full health levels. Additionally,
        the ghost may fabricate any single nonmagical
        weapon and single nonmagical set of armor, each of whose
        Resources cost is less than or equal to his Essence. For
        instance, if the ghost’s Essence is 3, he may create a great
        sword and a chain hauberk, but not plate-and-chain. The
        ghost may dissolve the Warrior Form at any time before the
        end of the Charm’s rolled duration, in which case, the

        Ghosts exist outside of the formal strictures of Creation.
        The body that a ghost creates for himself does not
        have to match the characteristics of his dead flesh, if he
        knows Birth the Perfected Master. Birth the Perfected
        Master creates a meat-body like Embody, except that it has
        the ghost’s full Ability scores. The flesh that Birth the
        Perfected Master creates reflects the ghost’s idealized self-image.
        The ghost may split six dots among the following
        Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina and Appearance.
        This body is created stark naked, and it lasts for five
        minutes for each success that the player achieves on a

        The ghost experiences his first birth in Creation, and
        his second birth comes when he enters the Underworld as
        one of the Restless Dead. This Arcanos allows the ghost to
        flicker back and forth between living and ghostly forms.
        Use of this Charm does not permit a ghost to take on a flesh
        form — in order to do that, he must use Materialize,
        Weighted With the Anchor of Flesh (see Exalted: The
        Abyssals) or one of the other Arcanoi in this tree. However,
        once manifest in a physical form, Unending Rebirth
        allows him to switch from immaterial to physical and back.
        The ghost can only activate this Charm once he is manifested,
        and it requires a Wits + Occult roll. If that roll
        succeeds, he may change back and forth from manifest to
        immaterial as he wishes until the duration of Unending
        Rebirth (or his manifestation Charm) expires. Each switch
        from flesh to ghost or back requires 1 mote of Essence and
        is a simple action. A “switch” of this nature does not
        terminate a manifestation Arcanos.
        For Example: The long-dead Master Cotep, manifest
        to visit his namesake in a village in the South, finds himself
        surrounded by angry villagers. He is already manifest in
        Creation. Cotep spends 8 motes and 1 Willpower (and his
        player rolls Wits + Occult) to activate Unending Rebirth,
        and he becomes immaterial. He runs through the wall of
        his namesake’s hut and past his foes. The next turn, he
        spends another mote to rematerialize and fight on his own
        terms. A few turns later, things are going badly, so he
        spends another mote to dematerialize and run for safety.

        Conjure the Defeated Vessel allows a ghost to bring a
        single ship, regardless of size, from the Underworld into
        Creation. Ordinarily, a ship crossing into Creation from a
        shadowland becomes intangible, just as ghosts do. Conjure
        the Defeated Vessel is used once the ship has entered the
        physical realm, and it makes the boat fully physical. The
        ghost’s player must roll Intelligence + Sail, and the boat
        remains fully physical for one hour per success. The ghost
        may spend additional Essence and his player reroll the
        Charm’s duration at any time — the duration of Conjure
        the Defeated Vessel is measured from that point onward
        and uses the new roll (in other words, if the Arcanos still
        has three hours duration left to it and the ghost spends 5
        motes of Essence and his player rerolls, getting four successes,
        the boat will stay physical for another four hours,
        not seven). Essence spent activating this Charm is committed
        until the effect’s duration expires, so ghosts will be
        drained of Essence if they attempt to maintain it overlong.<br>
        The ship’s Traits are all just as they would be in the
        Underworld (in other words, the same as any other boat of
        the same type and materials in Creation). It is considered
        to be intact (despite any appearances to the contrary) and
        has all its health levels (unless it suffers from unrepaired
        damage from the Underworld, in which case, it retains that
        damage). Once so manifested, the boat remains physical
        until its pilot or the ghost using this Arcanos becomes
        incorporeal again. The boat is blasted to ash and dust by
        direct sunlight (though if it stays in caves, travels only
        when it’s overcast or is shrouded by fog, it can survive until
        the Charm’s duration expires).

        This simple art allows an incorporeal ghost in the
        material world to sneak words out through the mouth of a
        living person. The ghost must “touch” the target and spends
        a mote of Essence, and his player rolls the ghost’s Dexterity +
        Expression. If he succeeds, the target involuntarily says what
        the ghost intended him to say — one word for every success
        achieved. The target does not immediately realize that she is
        speaking at all, but she can figure it out by her player
        succeeding at an Intelligence + Occult roll after someone
        around the character points out that she said words she
        doesn’t remember speaking. A conscious target who is aware
        that a ghost is manipulating her can resist such manipulation
        for the scene by spending a Willpower. If the target wishes to
        allow the ghost to speak through her, the ghost must spend 1
        mote of Essence per sentence but no roll needs to be made.
