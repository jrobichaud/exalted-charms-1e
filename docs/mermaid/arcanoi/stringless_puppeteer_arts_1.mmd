        Death sharpens a ghost’s perceptions. Ghosts can see
        better than mortals, can spot flaws more easily and can
        pick out the living from the dead at great distances. Some
        ghosts, however, have acquired even better methods of
        perception, and Spirit-Catching Eye Technique is one of
        them. This power lets a ghost see other ghosts who might
        normally be hidden from the eye. Ghosts who possess
        mortals or travel inside the bodies of other ghosts may be
        able to hide from normal observers, but Spirit-Catching
        Eye Technique reveals them.<br>
        When invoked, any ghosts or other spirits within view
        suddenly seem to glow with a pale white light. If the ghost
        is possessing a mortal, the ghost’s face overlays the host’s.
        If ghosts are traveling in another ghost’s body, each is
        distinctly illuminated through the host’s ectoplasmic flesh,
        which becomes transparent. The power lasts only an
        instant, and the ghost may or may not (reflexive Perception
        + Awareness roll, difficulty 2) be able to recognize the
        ghostly faces she sees hiding in mortal or unliving flesh.<br>
        Those spotted by use of this power are not aware
        they’ve been noticed, unless the ghost doing the spotting
        gives the game away through a reaction of some sort.

        This technique allows a ghost to sense a target’s
        surface thoughts and feelings, picking up the rough gist of
        what the target is thinking about, as well as any strong
        emotions he might be experiencing. While this power does
        not allow the ghost to go rummaging through a victim’s
        subconscious, it does allow her to go &quot;along for the ride,&quot;
        as it were, and pick up knowledge pertaining to what the
        victim is doing at the moment. If the victim is reciting a
        password to pass an enchanted guardian, the ghost will
        hear it, but if the victim is trying on various pairs of shoes,
        it’s highly unlikely the password will come to the surface of
        his mind.<br>
        The use of Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline first
        requires the acquisition of a target. The victim must be
        within sight of the ghost, though no physical contact is
        required. (Once psychic contact is made, the ghost no
        longer needs to maintain proximity.) After a target has
        been identified, the next step is a Manipulation + Awareness
        roll (difficulty equal to the target’s Essence). Success
        on this roll allows the ghost to make contact. While
        contact is established, the ghost “hears” the target’s
        thoughts. She does not see through his eyes or hear
        through his ears. However, the victim’s thoughts are easily
        distinguishable from the ghost’s own.<br>
        Contact lasts for a single scene, though the ghost can
        extend it for another scene by spending a Willpower point.
        The ghost can continue to do this until she runs out of
        Willpower, if she so chooses. The victim does not know
        that his thoughts are being eavesdropped on, although
        Exalted and anyone with a Compassion of 3 or above may
        (Perception + Awareness, difficulty 1) have the distinct
        feeling he’s being watched.<br>
        Contact with the target is broken at the end of the
        scene, if the target is killed or rendered unconscious or if
        the ghost doing the eavesdropping is wounded or otherwise
        distracted (including any expenditure of Willpower
        for any other reason than to extend this Charm). This
        Arcanos works on ghosts as well as mortals.

        <br>
        Skin-Riding Prana builds upon the base established
        by Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline. However, in
        addition to allowing a ghost to simply skim the surface of
        the target’s mind, he can now make full use of the target’s
        senses. He can see through the victim’s eyes, hear through
        her ears and even catch the scent of whatever the target
        sniffs.<br>
        While Skin-Riding Prana is active, the input from the
        target overlays what the ghost himself sees and hears in a
        distant, transparent fashion. If the ghost concentrates, he
        can easily make out what the target is seeing and hearing.
        If there are distractions around the character, paying
        attention to both sensory inputs requires a Willpower roll,
        difficulty 1. Many practitioners of this power prefer to
        retreat to specially prepared chambers or tents if they can
        once contact has been established, the better to protect
        themselves from any outside input.<br>
        Other than the obvious, Skin-Riding Prana functions
        in the same way as does Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline.
        The victim must be within sight of the ghost, though
        no touch is required. After a target has been identified, the
        next step is a Manipulation + Awareness roll (difficulty
        equal to the target’s Essence). Success on this roll allows
        the ghost to make contact, and once psychic contact is
        made, the ghost no longer needs to maintain proximity.
        This Arcanos works on ghosts as well as mortals.

        A Six Demon Bag is a boon to ghostly smugglers,
        assassins and couriers of all persuasions. It is equally the
        bane of border patrols, bodyguards and customs agents.
        This power allows a ghost to create a hollow within
        herself in which she can store small items without a hint
        of evidence.<br>
        When using a Six Demon Bag, the ghost tears open a
        gap in her flesh and inserts the item to be carried there —
        be it cash, a dagger, a scroll or anything else inert and up
        to one cubic foot in area — into the hollow thus created.
        The ghost’s flesh is then sealed up around it, and the item
        rests more or less comfortably within the ghost herself.
        Experienced couriers know to sheathe weapons and the
        like, lest a smuggled knife cut its way out during a particularly
        energetic moment.<br>
        The mechanical effect of this Charm is to add +4
        difficulty to a searching character’s player’s Perception +
        Awareness roll when contesting the Wits + Larceny roll
        the smuggler’s player makes to conceal an object. Removing
        the object from the Six Demon Bag costs an
        additional 3 motes of Essence. The ghost can eject the
        item from her body at any time, or she can wait for the
        Arcanos to expire, at which point the item pops out on
        its own. The item can be cut out of the ghost in question
        as well. This doesn’t cost the additional 3 motes, but it
        does inflict damage on the ghost — three health levels of
        unsoakable lethal damage. Items carried in a Six Demon
        Bag do show up when the ghost is viewed with Spirit-
        Catching Eye Technique. This negates the Charm’s
        bonus, but the ghost’s player can still make a Wits +
        Larceny roll for the ghost to shield the compartment.

        Mortal-Shadowing Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 7 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One hour<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>

        Prerequisite Charms: Soul-Whispering Empathy Discipline<br>
        <br>
        Mortal-Shadowing Technique is the next step on the
        road to possession. A ghost using Mortal-Shadowing Technique
        can literally meld into a mortal’s body, journeying
        with him and experiencing all that he experiences. This
        includes everything from ecstasy to death, though the
        latter forces the ghost out of the host’s body.
        Activation of this power requires, first of all, finding
        a target. Once the ghost has a target, she has merely to
        touch him or make an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack that need do no damage. Her player then makes a
        Dexterity + Awareness roll, with a difficulty equal to the
        target’s permanent Essence. If the roll is successful, the
        ghost sinks into the flesh of her host and will journey with
        him wherever he goes and whatever he does.<br>
        The host is unaware of the ghost unless she breaks her
        silence or otherwise gives herself away, but once he is aware,
        he can spend a Willpower point for his player to make a
        contested Willpower roll against the ghost. If the ghost
        loses, she is ejected from the body. If not, she remains.
        If the host is killed, the ghost is immediately forced
        out of the body. Note that while using Mortal-Shadowing
        Technique, the ghost cannot control or otherwise affect
        the body that she is &quot;possessing.&quot; She is merely a passenger,
        albeit an awake and aware one. Interestingly enough, any
        damage done to the host body manifests as bashing damage
        on the ghost.<br>
        Spending an additional Willpower point extends the
        effect for a day. More than one ghost at a time can use
        Mortal-Shadowing Technique, but if one extends control
        to the level of Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand, the rest are
        ejected instantly, with the host none the wiser.

        Unlike Mortal Shadowing Technique, this Arcanos
        allows for true possession. Once in command of the
        mortal body, the ghost truly controls it. She can use any
        of the body’s Attributes and Abilities, but she is not privy
        to the host’s secrets or knowledge. If the victim is Exalted,
        she can use all his attunements and automatic
        effects, and any reflexive effects the Exalt activates to
        preserve his frame, but the ghost has no access to the
        Exalt’s Charms. The ghost can also use her Arcanoi,
        including those involving effects to the ghost’s body such
        as Ghost-Devil Form. Any transformation and reshaping
        lapses the instant the ghost departs the victim’s frame.
        The puppeteer uses her own Essence and not the host’s to
        power any Arcanoi she activates.<br>
        Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand requires a Dexterity +
        Compassion roll with a difficulty equal to twice the target’s
        permanent Essence. The possessing ghost may extend the
        effects of this Charm for an additional hour by expending
        1 Willpower per hour, but her player must succeed at the
        possession roll again each time the duration is extended.
        During the possession, the body’s native intelligence is
        removed from authority and has no awareness of what his
        body does while it is possessed unless the ghost wants to let
        him watch. Needless to say, this can produce some awkward
        situations, as the ghost is under no obligation to leave
        the host in better shape than she found him.<br>
        If so possessed, the reflexive Charms of one of the
        Exalted continue to defend his body. The Exalt’s player
        should decide intelligently what reflexives activate when,
        but the consciousness of the Exalt is not making the
        decisions, the player is just portraying the character’s
        supernatural combat training.

        This Arcanos allows a ghost to acquire a host more
        pliable and convenient than a living human. Instead of a
        living host, he possesses a corpse and manipulates its dead
        flesh as a ghost using Puppeteer’s Masterful Hand manipulates
        the living. Because there is no resistance, the
        character’s player need only succeed in a difficulty 1
        Strength + Compassion roll for the ghost to inhabit the
        corpse. The only limitation is that the magic animating
        the body isn’t strong enough to hold disarticulated bones
        together, so there must be enough flesh remaining to
        actually move the corpse.<br>
        A ghost using this Charm may extend the duration by
        paying the activation cost again. His player may spend an
        experience point to make the possession permanent. This
        locks the ghost in the body, free of charge, until he chooses
        to leave. When he abandons it, it can never be inhabited
        again. As a corpse will decay to the point of uselessness in
        just a few weeks, most nemissaries are very hard on permanently
        possessed bodies. Ghosts who know this Arcanos
        and have access to their own corpse can possess it permanently
        without the cost of an experience point.

        The possession of the human form is easiest for the
        dead, as they were themselves once human. Yet, with
        refinement of their skills, the dead can also possess animals
        as well. This Arcanos allows a ghost to possess the corpse
        of any beast no larger than a wolf. It is most typically used
        on raitons, because they mummify naturally and can be
        made to fly even when long dead. The Deathlords use
        veritable legions of such spies. When in possession of an
        animal’s body, the ghost has all of its Physical Attributes
        but otherwise uses his own Traits. As with Nemissary’s
        Ride, the character’s player need only make a difficulty 1
        Strength + Compassion roll to effect the possession.

            This Arcanos is a type of Ox-Body Charm that works
            only on vessels the ghost is riding or possessing. While it
            doesn’t add anything to the ghost’s health levels, it dramatically
            fortifies all vessels she is skinriding using
            Mortal-Shadowing Technique, Nemissary’s Ride or subsequent
            Arcanoi in the tree. Some ghosts skinride mortal
            descendants to protect them in battle, while others augment
            possessed corpses to increase their own battlefield prowess.
            When a ghost departs the vessel she was riding, the extra
            health levels are crossed off, whether they held damage or
            not. Each purchase imparts one -0 and one -1 health level
            on the ghost’s vessel. A ghost can buy this Charm as many
            times as she has dots in her Compassion rating. Storytellers
            should note that a ghost’s own Ox-Body Technique does
            not fortify hosts, only her own plasm.
            This Arcanos is particularly helpful when the ghost is
            riding a smaller animal, such as a raiton, which usually has
            far fewer health levels than a human being.

            With this Arcanos, a nemissary refines her ability to
            possess and animate dead flesh. She may automatically
            commandeer a corpse as if using Nemissary’s Ride (see
            Exalted: The Abyssals, p. 250) but requires no roll to do
            so. Such possession lasts until the ghost withdraws the
            Essence committed to the Arcanos. Finally, a body possessed
            using the Embalmer’s Art does not decay. Any
            existing decay from prior to possession remains, and the
            body resumes decomposing normally if the ghost leaves it.
            Furthermore, the nemissary may fortify the vessel it’s
            riding with Essence. For every 4 additional motes of
            Essence the ghost commits to the vessel, it gains a -2 health
            level. The ghost can impart up to its Compassion rating in
            additional health levels on a vessel this way.
            Nemissaries wanting to develop their powers even
            further can purchase a superior version of this Arcanos
            called the Embalmer’s Enduring Triumph. This Arcanos

            Compassion •••, Essence •••• and the Embalmer’s Art
            as a prerequisite. However, the Embalmer’s Enduring
            Triumph costs only 10 motes and 1 Willpower to activate
            and 2 motes per -1 health level, and the Willpower cost is
            waived if the ghost is in a shadowland.

                Among the most powerful — and sometimes most
                painful — Arcanoi used by nemissaries, Instauration of the
                Fleshly Vessel allows a ghost to repair damage to a body she
                is possessing, whether that damage was caused by rot or
                combat. Many ghosts dislike this Arcanos because of the pain
                it causes them, but it provides the nemissary with options for
                keeping a war body useful well beyond its usual duration.
                The first technique in this Arcanos repairs rotting
                damage. Every 4 motes of Essence the ghost channels into
                this Charm undoes all rotting damage sustained over the
                course of a single day. In most climates, an unprotected
                corpse will last from six to eight weeks before it becomes
                structurally compromised. At that point, the vessel loses
                two permanent health levels per day until it reaches zero
                health levels, at which point it is little more than a jumble
                of bones and necrotic goo.<br>
                A nemissary using this Arcanos can take control of a
                vessel that may have gone untended a bit too long and
                render it more habitable. Bodies rot at a different rate
                depending on the climate. In the extreme North and
                South, bodies are mummified by the cold or arid climates
                and last for several months before ceasing to function. In
                warm, humid climes, a corpse may last only a couple of
                weeks before falling into a putrescent gray mass, and a
                nemissary may need to use this Arcanos frequently to keep
                her vessel intact. The Storyteller determines how often
                this Arcanos needs to be used on a body to keep it in good
                repair. Repeated uses of this Charm on even extremely
                decayed flesh can, eventually, result in a body that looks as
                though it’s only moments past its final breath. Once the
                ghost has repaired a possessed body with this Arcanos, she
                may use the Embalmer’s Art to preserve the corpse’s
                improved state indefinitely.<br>
                The other use of this Charm heals damage taken by
                the nemissary’s vessel, but at the expense of her corpus. For
                1 mote of Essence per health level, the nemissary bleeds
                her own integrity into the vessel to restore it. She suffers
                one unsoakable level of damage per level regenerated, with
                the type of damage appropriate to the type healed. She may
                heal bashing or lethal injuries in any order. Ghosts with
                the Ox-Body Technique Arcanos (a Conviction Arcanos
                with no Prerequisites and an Essence and Conviction
                minimum of 1 that gives two -2 levels per purchase, up to
                a limit of the ghost’s Conviction rating — see the Exalted
                Players Guide, pp. 83-84) are far more capable of using
                this Charm than other ghosts.<br>
                This Charm cannot heal damage caused by fire, aggra-
                vated sources or magic specifically designed to inflict
                deleterious effects on the undead (such as that caused by
                the Zeniths’ anima flare or the Charms Solar Spike or
                Blazing Solar Bolt).

            Prerequisite Charms: Nemissary’s Ride<br>
            <br>
            Nemissary’s Ride allows a ghost to possess and ani-
            mate a shell as large as a very large (eight feet tall, 400
            pound) human. To animate corpses larger than that (or
            the multiple connected corpses of some necromantic war
            machines), the ghost must know Drive the Necrotic Co-
            lossus. This Charm allows ghosts to animate the bodies of
            even the largest natural animals and war machines up to
            the size of a large temple. If the shell to be animated is larger
            than that (as the largest war machines and behemoth
            corpses are), then multiple nemissaries must work in
            concert to animate it.<br>
            Once the player spends the experience point, the
            character no longer has to commit Essence to the Charm.
            At that point, the nemissary stays inside the war machine
            she’s “piloting” until she decides to leave.<br>
            The 30 nemissaries that propel Mask of Winter’s
            Juggernaut do so through the use of this Charm.
