        World-Bridging Meditation<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 4 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>

        Ghosts maintain links to the world they left be-
        hind, willingly or no. World-Bridging Meditation
        enables a ghost to check in on those things that still
        matter. While it does not provide tremendous detail, it
        does give enough information to allow the ghost to
        know the basics of what’s going on with his Fetters. For
        many of the dead, that’s enough.<br>
        To employ World-Bridging Meditation, the ghost
        requires a moment of peace and quiet in which to meditate.
        If the circumstances are noisy or disruptive, a
        Willpower roll is required. Once the ghost is calm enough
        to continue, the player announces what Fetter the ghost is
        attempting to sense. It must be a Fetter — otherwise, the
        connection won’t be strong enough to allow the ghost to
        peer through the veil of death. At that point, a Wits +
        Temperance roll is made. If it is successful, the ghost gets
        a sense of the current state of the object or person. What
        the ghost gets is nothing more than a general assessment —
        health, condition and not much more. If the person is dead
        (or the object has been destroyed) the ghost is instantly
        aware of it and feels a cold, hollow absence.

        <br>
        Sometimes, a momentary glimpse isn’t enough. In
        these cases, the ghost wishes to establish a more permanent
        link. In that case, Death-Avoiding Monitor is a useful
        technique for letting the ghost remain constantly aware of
        the condition of an object. The Death-Avoiding Monitor
        lets the ghost know when the object — or person’s —
        condition changes. Such changes include — but are not
        limited to — injury, illness, death, falling in love and
        pregnancy, in the case of a person, or structural damage or
        destruction, in the case of an object. The sense of the object
        stays in the background and only intrudes when the ghost
        concentrates or when the monitored condition changes.
        The object does not need to be one of the ghost’s Fetters.<br>
        Establishing the Death-Avoiding Monitor requires a
        Perception + Temperance roll, difficulty 1. If the ghost
        wishes to extend the effect of the Death-Avoiding Monitor,
        his player can do so by extending an experience point. This
        allows the effect to carry over for a year and a day. Adding
        a second experience point makes the effect permanent.

        Extension of the Friendly Gaze<br>

        <br>
        Extension of the Friendly Gaze allows a ghost to peer
        in on another ghost’s Fetters. By laying a hand on her
        fellow shade, the ghost can peer across the barrier between
        worlds to see how the Fetter is faring. This information is
        not magically shared with the target, which allows the
        ghost gathering it to use the power in a potentially unscrupulous
        manner.<br>
        The first step in the Extension of the Friendly Gaze is
        simple physical contact between the ghost and her peer. If
        the other ghost is willing, this is automatic. If not, it
        requires a successful Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack, which need do no damage. Once physical contact,
        be it ever so brief, has been established, the player of the
        ghost attempting to use this Arcanos makes a reflexive
        Wits + Mediation roll at a difficulty of (5 - the Fetter rating
        of the object). If successful, the ghost gets the same sort of
        information about one of the target’s Fetters that she
        would have gotten from using World-Bridging Meditation
        for herself. If the target is not consenting, the Storyteller
        chooses the object or individual the ghost learns about.<br>
        <br>
        TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY<br>
        There is no way for a ghost to know if her
        counterpart also has the ability to perform Ex-
        tension of the Friendly Gaze. If a ghost uses the
        power on a ghost who also possesses it, that ghost
        may, in turn, use it, reflexively and simultaneously,
        on his assailant.

        With Veil-Piercing Binding, a ghost can do for others
        what Death-Avoiding Monitor allows him to do for himself.
        This Arcanos binds an object or person in the lands of
        the living to the consciousness of a ghost, allowing her to
        perform a check on its status whenever she wants.<br>
        Veil-Piercing Binding must be invoked the turn after
        Extension of the Friendly Gaze. The ghost’s player makes an
        Endurance + Meditation roll (difficulty 2). If it succeeds, the
        Fetter the ghost saw with Extension of the Friendly Gaze is
        bound to the target. As with Death-Avoiding Monitor, the
        target must spend a point of Essence each time she wishes to
        check in on her bound Fetter. Veil-Piercing Binding can
        only bind one object or person at a time, but it can be used
        more than once on an individual ghost.<br>
        The duration of Veil-Piercing Binding can be extended
        by the expenditure of experience points. One
        experience point prolongs the effect for a year; two makes
        it permanent.

        Mark of the Relentless Hunter<br>

        <br>
        The Mark of the Relentless Hunter allows a ghost to
        not only know the rough condition of a Fetter, but also to
        sense its location and direction. While Mark of the Relentless
        Hunter is in effect, the ghost can effortlessly sense
        the Fetter and, thus, can track it even across the worlds.
        The connection, once forged, is unbreakable by any natural
        means, and the ghost’s sense of his Fetter is unshakable.
        Only the end of the Arcanos’ duration or the destruction
        of the item will serve to break the connection naturally.
        The Mark of the Relentless Hunter can also be set on
        an item or person bound to a ghost through either Death-Avoiding
        Monitor or Veil-Piercing Binding. The object
        must be specified before the Essence and Willpower is
        spent, at which point the player of the ghost activating the
        Arcanos makes a Perception + Meditation roll (difficulty
        2 if it’s being performed on another ghost, difficulty 1 if the
        ghost is performing it on herself). If the roll is successful,
        the ghost now has a fix on the item and can summon up its
        condition and direction without expenditure of Essence.
        Expending 1 experience point can extend the Mark
        out to a year. A second experience point makes the sign
        permanent. Characters who have this Charm’s effects
        binding them to an object can develop Fetters relating to
        it more easily and cheaply. See Chapter Seven: Storytelling
        for details. If another ghost is the beneficiary of this
        Arcanos, his player must spend the experience points.
        Essence committed to the Charm is released when it is
        made permanent with experience.<br>
        <br>
        THE ETERNAL HUNT<br>
        Once the Mark of the Relentless Hunter has
        been made permanent, even death cannot exert
        power over it. A ghost can find a loved one or a hated
        enemy who passes into the Underworld by virtue of
        a Mark placed during life.

        Sensing the Delicate Strands allows a ghost to get a
        mental image of the things that are important to another
        ghost. It is also a key step in performing Chain-Shattering
        Discipline, illuminating a target who would otherwise
        be unknowable.<br>
        Using the Arcanos does not require physical contact.
        Instead, the ghost must only be within sight of her target.
        Once the object of her attentions has been picked out, the
        ghost’s player makes a Perception + Occult roll (difficulty
        3). A success gives the ghost basic knowledge of one of the
        target’s Fetters. The character knows the distance to, the
        direction of, the appearance of and the general nature of
        the subject’s attachment to the Fetter. At no additional
        cost, the ghost’s player can keep rolling until she fails. Each
        success reveals another secret.<br>
        If an attempt at Sensing the Delicate Strands fails, 24
        hours must elapse before the ghost can make another
        attempt on the same target. A ghost whose mind has been
        read thus is not aware that Sensing the Delicate Strands
        has been used on him, regardless of whether the attempt
        succeeds or fails.

        Chain-Shattering Discipline is the inverse of powers
        such as Veil-Piercing Binding. Instead of binding a ghost to
        a Fetter, this Arcanos instead shatters that bond. Once the
        ghost has identified a target, she can choose to break the
        ghost’s connection to it. Once the connection is broken, the
        Fetter is gone. It and its representation no longer provide
        any benefits, nor can the ghost nor any other ghosts spy on
        it with Arcanoi for sensing or locating Fetters. The connection
        is lost, irretrievably and irrevocably.<br>
        The use of Chain-Shattering Discipline requires either
        visual contact with the target and a successful use of
        Sensing the Delicate Strands or possession of something
        belonging to the target, which is broken when the Charm
        is activated. A Strength + Temperance roll with difficulty
        equal to the target’s permanent Essence plus the strength
        of the Fetter is required to actually break the link.
        The target is instantly aware of the breaking of the
        link, even if there was no active connection between the
        two at the time. The victim’s player must also succeed on
        a Willpower roll, or his character goes mad for a number of
        days equal to the attacker’s Temperance rating.

        Any ghost who can touch another’s Fetters is painfully
        aware that someone may be doing the same thing to them.
        This knowledge made the development of Weaver Guards
        the Loom — the most basic defense against this sort of
        aggression — a necessity. By exercising Weaver Guards the
        Loom, the ghost gathers the threads of his Fetters, so as to
        know when another hand is touching them.<br>
        Activating Weaver Guards the Loom requires an
        Intelligence + Meditation roll (difficulty 1). If successful,
        the ghost is now automatically protected against Fetter-
        related intrusion. He need not think about it and can
        reflexively renew the protection when its duration lapses.<br>
        While Weaver Guards the Loom is in effect, the
        ghost’s player gets a reflexive Perception + Temperance
        roll (difficulty 1) in the instance of any attempt to use any
        Fetter monitoring or detection Charm against the ghost. If
        the action is detected, the ghost’s player can make a
        reflexive Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 3) to see if his
        character has an idea where the intrusion comes from.
        Success on this roll reveals the identity of the interloper.
        Weaver Guards the Loom does not prevent the intrusion.
        It merely reports the fact to the ghost whose Fetters are
        being violated. There is no way for the intruding ghost to
        know she has been detected.

        Weaver Guards the Loom provides awareness of intrusion.
        Farmer Defends the Unharvested Field allows the
        ghost to strike back. A supplement to its predecessor,
        Farmer Defends the Unharvested Field is generally invoked
        whenever Weaver Guards the Loom detects
        tampering with the character’s Fetters. As soon as the
        latter Charm detects an unwelcome intrusion of this sort,
        the ghost’s power strikes back invisibly. On a successful
        Wits + Mediation (difficulty 1) roll by the player of the
        ghost using this Charm, the offending party suddenly
        suffers sharp pain, akin to being struck with a glass-studded
        whip. This does 5L damage, soaked only with natural soak.
        The intruding ghost loses her concentration, the attempt
        she made automatically fails, and her identity is immediately
        known to her target. While the blow is strictly
        psychic, it does have a physical manifestation — the affect
        ghost bleeds from her sensory organs for several minutes.<br>
        While Farmer Defends the Unharvested Field is reflexive,
        a ghost can choose not to unleash it. The cost of
        the Arcanos is paid each time it is used, but there is no cost
        if the ghost refrains from using it. Farmer Defends the
        Unharvested Field can specifically preempt Chain-Shattering
        Discipline.
