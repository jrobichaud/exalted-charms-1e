        Waxen Ghostly Flesh<br>

        Cost: 5 motes<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>

        <br>
        With Waxen Ghostly Flesh, a ghost can adjust his
        form. Features can be lengthened or eradicated, appearances
        changed, height and girth added or decreased, and
        skin or hair color altered. Ghosts can assume improbable
        colors and shapes through the use of this Arcanos, and
        those whose appearance has been altered through the use
        of this Charm may be iridescent, inwardly glowing or
        painted with flawless funeral makeup. The ghost using the
        Charm spends Essence and then, molding his flesh as a
        potter would mold clay, adjusts the aspects of his appearance
        that he wishes to change.<br>
        A Dexterity + Craft (Moliation) roll indicates the
        success level of the attempt, with the amount of change
        the ghost is attempting to render determining the difficulty.
        Note that using this power restricts the ghost to a
        roughly human form of mass roughly equivalent to the
        ghost’s own, and it does not grant useful armor, fangs or
        claws (though it can create the appearance of such). The
        ghost is simply reshaping himself, not drawing new ghostly
        matter from elsewhere.<br>
        After a scene, the ghost’s flesh begins to melt back
        toward its customary form. The process is visible to anyone
        observing the ghost closely (Perception + Awareness roll)
        and is a useful and time-honored method of flushing out
        ghostly impostors. A ghost thus reshaped can spend a
        Willpower point to arrest the slide back to his usual form
        for an hour, at which point the process picks up where it
        left off. This process can be repeated as long as the ghost
        has the Willpower to spend.<br>

        Nine Terrors Visage<br>

        With Nine Terrors Visage, a ghost can instantly
        assume another face without so much as moving a muscle.
        The ghost’s image simply shifts and changes. The mask
        remains in place for an hour, at which point it melts and
        shifts back to the ghost’s original appearance. The change
        in visage can be maintained for an additional day by the
        expenditure of a Willpower point.<br>
        Many ghosts have a series of visages they use on a
        regular basis, ranging from the horrifying to the alluring.
        Creating a visage requires a day’s effort, a successful Dex-
        terity + Craft (Moliation) roll to plan and a Dexterity +
        Compassion (difficulty 2 for normal visages) roll to create.
        If the rolls are successful, the visage is now available for the
        ghost to use whenever she pleases.<br>
        Some visages may be so horrifying and/or alluring that
        they may have an additional affect beyond simply chang-
        ing the ghost’s appearance. These Visages are +2 difficulty
        on the roll to create (planning difficulty as normal). Some
        visage effects include:<br>
        Fear: The players of all who see the ghost’s face must
        make a successful Valor roll (difficulty 1) or have their
        characters flee in terror for the duration of a scene. They
        will not be able to fight except in self-defense, and then, all
        rolls will still be at +2 difficulty.<br>
        Entrancement: Those who see the ghost’s face are so
        smitten with its otherworldly beauty that their players
        must succeed on a Temperance roll (difficulty 1) or have
        their characters become enraptured with the spirit. Such
        smitten souls are prone to follow the ghost’s suggestions or
        to do whatever they think will please the ghost of their
        own initiative.<br>
        Disgust: The ghost’s visage is so repulsive that the
        player of any observer must succeed on a Willpower roll
        (difficulty 1), or his character is caught in the throes of a
        brief bout of nausea. Players of those thus afflicted are at +1
        difficulty on their rolls for any physical activity. This effect
        persists for the remainder of the scene, but the character
        can only suffer from it once at a given time.<br>
        Once a character has successfully overcome the ef-
        fects of a Nine Terrors Visage, she is immune to the ghost
        using that particular visage on her ever thereafter. How-
        ever, those mortals who fail to resist are at +1 difficulty to
        resist it the next time. Four consecutive failures means that
        the character will never be able to resist the effects of that
        visage without a dramatic change in her mental makeup.
        This limitation does not apply to the Exalted, who are too
        mighty for such ghostly tricks.

        <br>
        The ghost’s spirit form becomes soft and pliable upon
        impact, rendering her more resistant to damage. The
        impact of a blow (or slash or stab) is still felt, but the ghost’s
        body simply distends, adjusting to the effects of the strike.
        The player of a ghost who activates this Charm may roll
        her character’s full Dexterity + Craft (Moliation) pool
        against any attack the ghost is aware of. Every success
        subtracts one from the damage of a single lethal or bashing
        attack. This roll is made after the attack is resolved but
        before soak is applied.<br>
        Even if the blow does no damage, the ghost will
        usually be deformed by it in some way. A strike to the
        head will crush the shape of the ghost’s skull; a slash to
        the arm may deform it beyond recognition. The effects
        are merely cosmetic, however, and the deformation
        quickly heals itself. For every level of damage sopped up
        by the Yielding Spirit Form, it takes one turn for the
        ghost’s unliving tissue to restore itself to its original form.
        This process is constant, but additional damage absorbed
        during this time adds to the duration of the recovery.

        Steeling the Spirit lets a ghost fix in place his altered
        features or form. A Willpower roll determines how many
        days the steeled flesh remains. The effect is extended for
        one day for each success. This power, however, can only be
        used by the ghost on himself.<br>
        In addition, when used in conjunction with Ghost-
        Devil Form to harden protrusions such as fangs, claws
        and the like, such accouterments are treated as if they
        are exceptional weapons and gain the same number of
        bonus points.

        Ghost-Devil Form allows the ghost to adopt not just
        a new face, but rather, a new form entirely. This form can
        be human or otherwise and can sport working claws,
        talons, fangs and the like. A Ghost-Devil Form can be up
        to twice the ghost’s normal size and can feature such
        extras as additional working limbs, armor and so forth. It
        does not need to be human in the slightest, and the
        change from regular form to Ghost-Devil Form is effectively
        instantaneous.<br>
        Like Nine Terrors Visage, a Ghost-Devil Form must
        be conceptualized beforehand. Crafting a Ghost-Devil
        Form takes longer than making a Nine Terrors Visage,
        however, and is more difficult. Building a form requires an
        Intelligence + Craft (Moliation) roll to design and then a
        Dexterity + Compassion roll (Difficulty 3) to execute.
        Each damage-dealing or similar aspect of the form (claws,
        fangs, extra arms) requires an additional day of design work
        and an additional Craft (Moliation) roll at difficulty 2 to
        build. Ghost-Devil Form is also similar to Nine Terrors
        Visage in its duration and effects on observers. This Arcanos
        almost always has its effect extended through the use of
        Steeling the Spirit or some other, more powerful Charm of
        permanency. Only ghosts and ghostly beings can be re-
        shaped with the power of this Charm.

        <br>
        When Weighted With the Anchor of Flesh, a ghost
        obtains the ability to materialize in the lands of the living.
        If he does so when in Ghost-Devil Form, then all of the
        weaponry available to him in that shape retains its potency.
        In short, the ghost materializes and can affect the
        living world normally, for good or for ill, until the Anchor
        lifts and he fades back to insubstantiality.<br>
        While held by the Anchor of Flesh, the ghost can be
        wounded by material weapons and is otherwise normal and
        material. If wounded, he will bleed (though the blood will
        fade as he does), and if struck down, he will fall before
        dissipating back into the Underworld.<br>
        The Anchor’s duration is one hour. However, the
        ghost can extend this by expending another point of
        Willpower for each additional hour he wishes to remain.
        Ghosts who have materialized thus are still vulnerable to
        banishment and to effects that specifically target material-
        ized spirits.

        Prerequisite Charms: Waxen Ghostly Flesh<br>
        <br>
        Stolen Wax Discipline allows a ghost to reshape the
        unliving tissues of another ghost. It only works on willing
        subjects but is useful for disguising friends, theatrical
        performances and the like.<br>
        Using Stolen Wax Discipline requires the laying of
        hands upon the target, as well as a successful Dexterity +
        Compassion roll. The difficulty of the roll depends on the
        degree of change being attempted (see Waxen Ghostly
        Flesh for a guideline to appropriate difficulties). The
        effects of the Arcanos last one hour per point of the
        shaping ghost’s permanent Essence and cannot be ex-
        tended through the use of Willpower. To extend its effects,
        either the ghost doing the shaping must use Prison of the
        New Form, or the ghost receiving the changes must use
        Steeling the Spirit.

        Unlike Stolen Wax Discipline, Broken Mold Strike
        allows a ghost to inflict the horrors of reshaped flesh on an
        unwilling target. Using Broken Mold Strike requires a
        successful Brawl attack, which need do no damage, fol-
        lowed by a reflexive Strength + Compassion roll.
        A ghost attacking with Broken Mold Strike shreds
        and boils off the target’s ectoplasm doing a base lethal
        damage equal to the ghost’s Willpower + (successes on the
        Strength + Compassion roll) + any extra successes on the
        attack. This attack works only against other ghosts or
        against creatures that partake of ghostly nature and can be
        subjected to the Shifting Ghost-Clay Path. This does not
        include deathknights, whose physical substance shields
        them from this attack.

        Shaping the Obedient Servant is the means by which
        a ghost can use the powers associated with Ghost-Devil
        Form on another. Frequently used by servants of the
        Deathlords to create monstrous ghostly warriors for battles
        among the dead, this power is also a favorite of artisans,
        costumers and others among the dead who depend on
        disguise as part of their livelihood.<br>
        Shaping the Obedient Servant requires the expenditure
        of the Arcanos cost, followed by the regular difficulty 3
        Dexterity + Compassion roll for Ghost-Devil Form. Obedient
        Servant shapes must be planned ahead of time, just like
        Ghost-Devil Form, but if all the results are going to look the
        same, only one roll needs to be made to plan the change.<br>
        Often, the Deathlords and their more powerful seneschals
        wish to make the effects of Shaping the Obedient
        Servant permanent. This can be accomplished through a
        successful Willpower roll and the expenditure of experience
        points on the part of the character being reshaped.
        The more experience points expended, the longer the
        effect lasts. A single experience point freezes it for a
        month, 2 points for a year, and 3 points extend the effect
        indefinitely. Essence is no longer committed to the effect
        once experience points are spent to extend it. This Arcanos
        works only on the dead.

        Prison of the New Form enables a ghost to seal her
        target into his current form, willing or no. The character
        must touch the target or make a successful unarmed
        Brawl or Martial Arts attack that need not do damage. A
        successful contested roll of the attacking ghost’s Stamina
        + Compassion against the target’s Conviction enables
        the ghost to lock down the victim’s form for one week per
        extra success. During this time, he cannot be affected by
        any other spirit-flesh crafting power that alters his form,
        but he remains vulnerable to damage from powers such as
        Broken Mold Strike. Prison of the New Form is often used
        to keep prisoners in an eyeless, mouthless or limbless
        state. Obviously, this Arcanos works only against ghosts
        or ghostly creatures.
