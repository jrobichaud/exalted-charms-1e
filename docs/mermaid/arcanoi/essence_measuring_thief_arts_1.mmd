        Aura-Reading Technique<br>

        Aura-Reading Technique allows a ghost to see how
        much Essence another being — be it a ghost, another spirit
        or an Exalted — contains within her. Use of Aura-Reading
        Technique requires a successful Perception + Larceny roll.
        If the roll is successful, the ghost can perceive the aura of
        anything he looks at for a single scene. This allows the ghost
        to literally see the Essence burbling within the target. The
        ghost cannot do anything about this, nor can he share his
        vision with another. However, this technique does allow
        him to assess those he comes in contact with quickly.<br>
        To a ghost using Aura-Reading Technique, the color
        of the target’s aura correlates to the amount of Essence she
        contains. The “aura” the Arcanos displays is not a true
        aura. Rather, it is a colorful display that, to the ghost’s eyes,
        appears to overlay the target’s silhouette. It is visible
        regardless of ambient light, but the ghost must be aware of
        the target’s presence before he can use Aura-Reading
        Technique. In other words, it this Charm cannot be used
        for detection, only assessment.<br>
        <br>
        Color Number of Motes
        Black Zero
        Indigo 1-5
        Green 5-10

        <br>
        There is no way for the target of an Aura-Reading
        Technique to know that she has been spied upon in this
        manner. The Technique has an effective range equal to
        the ghost’s sight range, and as such, ghosts skilled in its
        usage are often used as lookouts by the Deathlords.

        Delicious Essence Scent does not allow a ghost to
        determine how much Essence someone contains. Rather,
        it enables the ghost to sniff out living sources of Essence.<br>
        To use Delicious Essence Scent, the ghost spends a
        mote of Essence, and his player makes a Perception +
        Dexterity roll (difficulty 2). A success immediately fills the
        ghost’s nostrils with the scent of Essence, which the ghost
        can follow to its source. The stronger the source, the more
        potent the trail, and the easier it is for the ghost to follow.
        The ghost’s player makes a Perception + Temperance roll,
        with a difficulty equal to (4 - the permanent Essence of the
        target [minimum 1]). If the roll is successful, the ghost is
        aware of the character’s location and permanent Essence.
        The power has a range of 100 yards.<br>
        As the ghost is detecting pure Essence, Delicious
        Essence Scent pierces illusions, veils and disguises that do
        not also cloak the character’s magical nature. If anything
        living is within range, Delicious Essence Scent can find it.

        Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch lets a ghost absorb
        another ghost’s Essence through the brush of a fingertip.
        Any touch is sufficient to let the ghost drain the target’s
        energies, though it must, in fact, be a touch. Mere proximity
        is not enough for Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch to
        work. To use Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch, the ghost
        must succeed on an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack,
        which need do no damage.<br>
        When the power activates, the player of the ghost
        makes a difficulty 2 Manipulation + Larceny roll. Each
        success on the roll strips away 2 motes of Essence from the
        victim. This Essence does not flow to the ghost. Rather, it
        dissipates and can be used by no one. When Essence-Devouring
        Ghost Touch is used by several ghosts in
        conjunction, it is a deadly tactic. In particular, it is a
        favorite tool of hungry ghosts, who use it to swarm victims
        under when hunting. This Charm only works on
        ghosts and beings of a ghostly nature.

        Arcanos is invoked, at any point later in the turn, the ghost
        may make a Temperance roll (difficulty 1). A success lets her
        absorb a number of motes equal to half the number stripped
        from the target. These motes are then available for her use, if
        necessary allowing her to retrigger Essence-Devouring Ghost
        Touch.

        Ravening Life-Force Hunger removes the protection the
        living have against the scourge of Essence-Devouring Ghost
        Touch. Not only does Ravening Life-Force Hunger affect
        ghosts, it also affects other spirits, Exalted and any other beings
        unfortunate enough to encounter it. The ghost must be
        materialized for the power to work, however. The technique
        for using Ravening Life-Force Hunger is precisely identical
        to that for Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch. Each success on
        the Manipulation + Larceny roll dissipates 2 motes of Essence
        for each success. The Essence dissipates and cannot be used
        by anyone. Non-Essence channelers who are affected by this
        Charm have their breath disrupted. Those whose players succeed
        at a Stamina + Endurance roll (difficulty 3) will survive,
        those whose players fail will be incapacitated by chills and mad
        hallucinations by the time the sun next crosses the horizon.
        They will die in (their Stamina) days unless they are tended by
        a character with Medicine 3 or higher who can correct their
        disrupted life rhythms.

        ghost. It makes available for the ghost’s use the Essence
        drained by Ravening Life-Force Hunger. When this Arcanos
        is active, whenever the ghost uses Ravening Life-Force
        Hunger or Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch, she
        can spend a Willpower for her player to make a reflexive
        Temperance roll (difficulty 1). Success lets her absorb a
        number of motes equal to the number stripped from the
        target, which are instantly available for her use. Her Essence

        <br>
        Blending the Streams of Essence reverses the flow of
        energy from Essence-Devouring Ghost Touch. Instead of
        draining Essence from the victim, Blending the Streams
        of Essence allows a ghost to give some of her own energy
        to another ghost, which he can then use for whatever
        purpose he desires. This energy can be used instantly by
        the recipient.<br>
        Using Blending the Streams of Essence requires a
        physical touch. If the target resists, it must be delivered
        as part of a successful unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack,
        which need do no damage. Once physical contact
        is made, the donor ghost’s player must succeed on a Temperance
        roll (difficulty 1). If it succeeds, she may transfer
        a number of motes equal to her Willpower rating to the
        intended recipient. He can, if he chooses, refuse the in-
        fusion, in which case the Essence is lost. The Essence
        given comes from the ghost’s own pool, and the ghost
        can never reduce her temporary Essence pool below 1
        with his Charm.<br>
        Blending the Streams of Essence can only be used
        on one ghost per scene. It is only effective on ghosts,
        and any attempt to use it on a living being wastes the
        ghost’s energies.

        Feeding Life’s Fountain allows a ghost to transfer his
        Essence to a living recipient. All of the rules and restrictions
        of Blending the Streams of Essence apply. If used
        on non-Essence-channelers, the effect is one of extreme
        good health and lasts for (the Essence of the ghost activating
        the Arcanos x the number of motes spent) days.
        The victim will have one automatic success on all Stamina
        + Resistance or Stamina + Endurance rolls to resist
        illness or poisoning and will not become ill from fatigue
        even if they eat badly or live under bad conditions. Living
        recipients are also very fertile, and it is through this
        Charm that ancestors answer their descendents’ fertility
        problems. This Charm cannot cure actual sterility, only
        reproductive difficulties. Giving birth to the child is often
        difficult for or fatal to the mother if she had difficulty
        bearing live children or carrying them to term.

        Masters of this technique create the gems and crystals
        laden with Essence that fuel the Underworld’s society.
        Filling the Precious Vial is nothing less than the
        ability to take one’s own Essence and pour it into an
        inanimate container for anyone to use.<br>
        Putting this power to use requires both the preparation
        of a suitable container, such as an Essence-containing
        gem or soulfire crystal and a Perception + Larceny
        roll (difficulty 2). Before the roll, the ghost’s player must
        announce the number of motes to be invested in the object.
        If the roll is a success, the motes are expended and
        the Essence is sealed in the container. Containers used
        for holding Essence are rare and delicate things. Soulfire
        crystals (see p. 254) are the most popular, followed by
        Essence-containing gems (see p. 255), though there are
        other options such as small carvings and mirrors that enjoy
        a certain amount of popularity. An Essence container
        that is cracked, however, is liable to go up in a massive
        explosion, doing one level of lethal damage per mote
        stored inside to anyone within 10 feet of the blast.<br>
        If the Willpower point is not spent activating this
        Charm, the Vial is still filled, but it will leak a mote a
        day. The expenditure of the Willpower seals the Vial and
        traps the Essence inside.

            With this Arcanos, a ghost may sire offspring with a
            human, God-Blood or Exalted woman. The ghost must be
            materialized, either through Weighted With the Anchor
            of Flesh (see E:Ab, p. 237) or by siring the child in a
            shadowland at night. It is also possible for the living to
            facilitate mating with copious doses of ghost flower tea (see
            Manacle and Coin, p. 45). Fertile Soul Endowment automatically
            fails in the Underworld, as the very principles of
            that dark realm oppose life. The ghost need not actually
            copulate with the living partner, though the two must
            exchange a minimum of a deep, passionate kiss. As such,
            female ghosts may use this Arcanos as readily as males.
            Finally, the living partner cannot already be pregnant.<br>
            If all the appropriate conditions are met, the ghost's
            player rolls Temperance + Essence against a difficulty of
            the partner's Essence rating. Ghosts with appropriate
            Passions may also channel them for additional dice, as
            normal. A failure means the living partner's Essence re-
            jects the energies and no conception takes place. A botch
            means the partner immediately becomes sterile unless her
            player makes a successful Stamina + Resistance roll (difficulty
            2). Exalted and other magical beings do not risk
            sterility from such a union.<br>
            A successful roll on the part of the ghost means the
            partner immediately conceives a Ghost-Blooded offspring,
            which she then carries to term normally. The living partner
            need not be willing or even know that conception has taken
            place. Essence used to power this Arcanos remains commit-
            ted until the birth of the child. The ghost may not voluntarily
            withdraw this commitment, and even the destruction of the
            ghost does not release the Essence prior to birth or end the
            pregnancy. A Ghost-Blooded child born of such a union will
            have innate power appropriate to the total Essence of its
            parents as normal. Ghosts that sire offspring upon Exalted
            women are more apt to produce Half-Caste children, though
            the Arcanos still affords the certainty of conception.
