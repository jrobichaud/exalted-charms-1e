        Ghosts are most comfortable in the dark of night, but
        that does not mean they always wish to go unseen in the
        darkness. Some ghosts wish to be seen, either to terrify the
        mortals who behold them or to illuminate the steps of
        those foolish enough to trust the dead as guides. By
        releasing 2 motes of Essence, a ghost can cause herself to
        glow with radiance as bright as the setting sun. Two or
        more ghosts acting in unison can combine their radiance,
        and when seven act in concert, the effect is as bright as the
        noonday sun in the Far Southern deserts. A ghost may
        choose to display any color, from the hideous green of
        grave mold to the warm gold of afternoon sunshine. When
        performed in the living world, the Corpse-Fed Radiance is
        visible even if the ghost is dematerialized.

        Darkness is more potent than light. Every dead man
        knows this. Thus does Black Breath of the Abyss surpass
        Corpse-Fed Radiance in the hierarchy of ghostly skills.<br>
        When summoned, the Black Breath of the Abyss is
        more than just a cloud of darkness. It is an utter absence of
        light that boils out of the ghost’s mouth, ears, nose and
        eyes. Devouring any normal source of light, the cloud
        extends for 10 feet around the ghost. If the ghost expends
        a Willpower point, the cloud will move in any direction of
        his choosing. Those caught in the cloud are utterly blinded
        — except ghosts, who can see through the darkness clearly.
        No light can penetrate its inky depths, and those trapped
        within subtract two successes from all attack rolls. The
        boundary for the Arcanos’ effect is as insubstantial as air
        and can be crossed simply by moving out of the area of
        effect, but the disorienting effect of the total darkness
        makes this difficult.<br>
        The Black Breath of the Abyss cannot be dispelled by
        normal light, though it will fade away in due time. The
        manifestation of a Solar anima banner within the cloud of
        darkness will also dispel it.

        Mere light is not always enough to work a ghost’s will.
        Storytellers among the dead use illusions to illustrate their
        tales, and artisans of terror regard well-crafted images as
        the most basic tools of their trade.<br>
        The illusions the dead craft by Painting the Sunset
        Picture are simple ones — a single image in three dimensions,
        with a basic color palette, immobile and faintly
        transparent. They can be as large as the ghost creating
        them wishes, though most of the Restless Dead prefer to
        keep their creations man-sized or smaller. Often, the
        images flicker or blur, revealing their artificial origins.<br>
        Painting the Sunset Picture requires a successful Wits
        + Craft (Pandemonium) roll against a difficulty of 1. More
        complicated illusions, such as the image of a tree individual
        leaves or a detailed reconstruction of the Palace
        Sublime are more difficult, and may reach as high as
        difficulty 3. The illusion’s appearance may move as fast or
        as slow as the ghostly creator wishes.<br>
        A ghost can sustain a Sunset Picture for an hour if she
        wishes by feeding it a point of Willpower. She can also
        create multiple illusions simultaneously, each with their
        own cost in Essence. Sunset Pictures that have run their
        course slowly fade away into transparency. The illusions of
        Painting the Sunset Picture are visible even when created
        in the lands of the living. The ghost need not materialize
        to make the illusions visible.

        Midnight Canvas Unfurled<br>

        Any ghost with a modicum of training can create a
        simple illusion. It is far more difficult to create a complex
        one, one that moves, speaks and gives the appearance of life.
        Midnight Canvas Unfurled is the tool of choice for
        these masters of illusion, and it serves them well. By
        utilizing this Arcanos, a ghost may craft an illusion that
        exists in three dimensions and is capable of movement.
        With a successful Wits + Craft (Pandemonium) roll by his
        player, the ghost summons the fleshed out illusion. The
        difficulty of this Charm is the same as that of Painting the
        Sunset Picture; the larger and more complex the illusion is,
        the higher the difficulty. By spending 5 additional motes of
        Essence, the master of the illusion can cause the illusion to
        affect a sense beside sight. Sound is most often used, but
        true craftsmen among the dead take delight in creating
        illusions so complex that they fool the living. These
        phantasms will even obey their creator’s wishes to move or
        speak, so long as the wishes are simple. The image lasts a
        single scene, unless sustained with an investment of Will-
        power. A single point of Willpower will extend the illusion’s
        lifespan to an hour.<br>
        Only the past masters among the dead have ever
        created a Midnight Canvas larger than a behemoth,
        though the Deathlords do so with some regularity and
        disdain. However, the artisans of the dead have compensated
        by learning how to add other touches of realism to
        their creations.<br>
        The illusions of Midnight Canvas Unfurled, like
        those of Painting the Sunset Picture, are visible even when
        created in the lands of the living. The ghost need not
        materialize to make the illusions visible. They can be seen,
        even if he cannot.

        This Charm gives the user the ability to summon large
        quantities of any sort of foul, harmless fluid out of thin air,
        and it can be employed to terrify, disgust or disturb with
        equal ease. Those using it can summon up to (their
        Conviction rating x 10) gallons of any harmless fluid they
        choose — blood and squirming but harmless maggots are
        acceptable, acids and flammable oils are not. This liquid
        manifests on the walls, floors, ceilings and other surfaces
        nearby, at the ghost’s discretion.<br>
        The uses of this power can be as benign as filling a pot
        with water or as malicious as making blood drip out of
        walls. The fluid will remain in place until it dries up or
        drains away, but in that time, it will have no visible source,
        and its flow cannot be stemmed. While the ichor that is
        created cannot be directly harmful, it can have dangerous
        secondary effects, such as rendering a steep staircase slip-
        pery or smearing the ink on a precious document.

        This Charm creates vermin and gives them brief life.
        The Messenger takes the form of a deathwatch beetle, rat
        or other small creature. Instantly responsive to the will of
        its creator, the creature scuttles forth to work his will. At
        the end of an hour, the Messenger will shrivel and die, but
        its life can be extended another hour by the expenditure of
        another point of Willpower by the ghost who summoned
        it. Messengers can be killed as per normal creatures of their
        type; a simple sword thrust or even a well-placed boot heel
        will do for most.<br>
        Creating a Messenger requires a Wits + Pandemonium
        roll. The difficulty is 2 for an insect or similarly small
        creature, difficulty 3 for anything else up to the size of a
        large rat. Nothing larger can be created through the use of
        this Charm. The Messenger appears at the ghost’s feet and
        goes forth into the world to do his bidding. While the
        Messenger has enough rudimentary intelligence to obey
        the ghost’s mental commands, it is not a familiar and still
        cannot be pushed beyond its innate capabilities. For ex-
        ample, a summoned rat may be able to climb walls, but it’s
        still not going to be able to transcribe a document or make
        complex judgments about humans.<br>
        Messengers may have fangs or claws, but even those
        created in the image of a poisonous creature such as a spider
        do not have venom. A ghost need not be materialized in
        order to use this Charm. Her odious minion will appear in
        the world of the living unless this Charm is used in the
        Underworld or in a shadowland at night.

        One rat. One spider. One serpent. A single example
        of any of these species can be overlooked, swatted or
        stepped on. A flood of them, however, is not so easy to
        dismiss. Six Plague Summons lets a ghost create and send
        forth an entire horde of vermin, which will happily swarm
        over, devour or trample anything before it. All that is
        required is the investment of Essence and Willpower and
        a successful Wits + Pandemonium roll (difficulty 2 for
        anything up to a mouse in size, 3 for anything up to a rat).<br>
        A Six Plague Summons can include anywhere from a
        half-dozen to thousands of creatures, depending on the
        success of the initial roll. The more successes scored, the
        more creatures, with the number going up by a factor of five
        for each success.<br>
        Number of Successes Approximate Number of Creatures Summoned<br>
        0 1-10<br>
        1 50<br>
        2 250<br>
        3 1250<br>
        4 6250<br>
        <br>
        Successes beyond four produce what is, for all
        intents and purposes, a numberless swarm.<br>
        <br>
        The downside is that a plague thus summoned is
        extremely difficult to control. The ghost who brings it
        forth can give it some rough direction (“Go east!” or
        “Chase him!”) but not much more than that. Vermin
        brought forth through this Charm are also ravenously
        hungry, making them even more difficult to control.
        Fortunately, the plague lasts one hour and one hour only
        and cannot be extended beyond that. A ghost need not be
        materialized in order to use this Charm. In fact, her
        festering swarm always appears in the world of the living,
        unless she invokes this Charm in the Underworld or at
        night in a shadowland.

        Not all of the dead are content to paint pictures in the
        air. Some wish to affect the lands of the living in a more
        tangible way. Hand of the Wind lets these ghosts reach out
        with more-than-ghostly force.<br>
        By exercising this Arcanos, the ghost fortifies his
        being with his will for an instant. During that time, he is
        capable of one action that affects the world of flesh as if he
        were a part of it. Whether that consists of striking a blow,
        stealing a trinket or pushing an archer lining up a shot is
        entirely up to the ghost. Any action the ghost takes is
        subject to an appropriate roll (The player of a ghost trying
        to snatch a First Age relic out of an enemy’s hand would
        have to roll Dexterity + Larceny, for example, while the
        player of one seeking to pick up an abandoned dagger and
        hurl it would roll Dexterity + Thrown). The ghost himself
        cannot be struck by mortal weapons during this time, as he
        is not actually materialized.<br>
        Note that Hand of the Wind can be used for only
        one action at a time, though with a loose definition of
        “one action.” Picking something up and throwing it is
        considered one action; holding a pen and writing a
        several thousand line epic poem is not. In general, there
        is not enough time for characters to split their dice pool.
        Hand of the Wind cannot be used in the Underworld.
        Its uses are limited to the living world and during the
        day in the shadowlands.

        What Strike of Dead Hands gives a ghost is physical
        power, pure and simple. By adding brute force to a blow
        enabled by Hand of the Wind, the ghost suddenly makes
        his interactions with the world of the living that much
        more devastating.<br>
        Strike of Dead Hands lasts, like its antecedent, for just
        one attack, but it is far more potent. Any attacks or
        Strength-based actions undertaken with this Arcanos
        have one additional automatic success, and any blow
        struck has additional lethal damage dice equal to the
        ghost’s Strength rating, meaning that the ghost’s Strength
        effectively doubles for the purposes of damage on the blow.
        Ghosts can use this Charm to strike blows with weapons,
        and a ghost armed with a daiklave can be a menace to an
        Exalt who cannot attack spirits. The ghost has no fine
        control of Strike of Dead Hands and, thus, cannot temper
        a blow or pull a punch when using it.

        One of the ultimate powers of the dead, Ebon Grasp of
        Oblivion strikes mercilessly and takes its victims back with
        it into the depths of the Abyss. Emerging from the ghosts
        facial orifices like the Black Breath, the Ebon Grasp mauls
        those it strikes, savaging their flesh and spirits. Those who
        are struck down by the Ebon Grasp are seized by it and taken,
        screaming, into the depths of the Underworld.
        All who are within a five-yard radius of the ghost’s
        mouth and eyes (other than the ghost activating the
        Arcanos) are subject to the Ebon Grasp’s hideous effects.
        Each turn the Ebon Grasp touches a target gives the cloud
        a reflexive Strength + Brawl attack against the victim,
        using the summoning ghost’s statistics. A successful attack
        does Strength + 2 lethal damage. If the target is reduced to
        Incapacitated or below, the next turn the cloud picks him
        up and begins dragging him into the Abyss. This process
        takes two turns to complete, during which time he can be
        rescued by a contested Strength roll against the cloud.
        Victims who are not rescued are drawn into the Abyss
        through the physical form of the summoning ghost, a
        disturbing and obscene process. The Ebon Grasp can be
        fought like any other physical threat. It does not dodge, has
        a soak of 6L/12B, has eight health levels and takes no
        wound penalties. It uses the characters Traits and acts on
        initiative 10. The Ebon Grasp of Oblivion ignores all
        attacks that do less that its soak, and weapons not made
        from the Five Magical Materials, subjected to Elemental
        Enchantment or otherwise enhanced do only bashing
        damage to the Ebon Grasp.

            success, the ghost can jump forward up to 30 minutes. The
            player rolls and determines the maximum amount of time
            the character can leap forward. After that maximum
            duration is determined, the character picks any amount of
            time up to that maximum that he wishes to jump. Note
            that the ghost cannot perceive events that happen in the
            interim, nor can he make conditional jumps — “jump
            forward until these guys leave” is not permitted. This
            Arcanos is a fine way to escape combat, but the ghost
            cannot jump backward. Any time he skips over is forever
            lost to him. This Charm can only be used in the Under-
            world, as Setesh’s Calendar has no power over Creation.

            Hours Like Autumn Leaves allows the most powerful
            ghosts to pull themselves and nearby companions
            forward along Setesh’s Calendar. For all ghosts caught in
            the pull of this Charm, the world seems to flicker as they
            jump forward in time. Observers see all ghosts affected by
            the Charm vanish, only to reappear later. The player of
            the ghost using this Charm must roll Intelligence +
            Occult and the ghost must spend 6 motes for himself and
            every entity to be dragged forward with him, as well as 1
            Willpower per being. For every success, the whole group
            can be moved forward in time up to 30 minutes. The
            player rolls and determines the maximum amount of time
            the group can leap forward, and after that maximum
            duration is determined, the character picks any amount
            of time up to that maximum that he wishes to jump. Note
            that the ghost cannot perceive events that happen in the
            interim, nor can he make conditional jumps — “jump
            forward until these guys leave” is not permitted. The total
            span jumped is at the discretion of the ghost using this
            Charm (those brought along have no control over the
            span of time over which they jump). Willing subjects of
            this Charm should be within 10 yards of the ghost using
            it. An unwilling subject can only be brought along if the
            ghost is physically touching her.<br>
            It is rumored that the ghosts of Stygia have a more
            powerful version of this Charm that allows ghosts to leap
            forward years, rather than hours.
