        The ghost with this Arcanos needs only for her player
        to successfully roll Perception + Craft to gain insight about
        the origins of a piece of soulsteel or a soulsteel artifact. For
        every success, the ghost can ask one simple, straightforward
        question about the physical details of previous handlers
        of an item or events for which the object was present or
        used. These events can predate the item’s destruction in
        Creation, if the object is in fact an echo of Creation.

        Soulsteel Shaper allows a ghostly artisan to aid in the
        creation of soulsteel items. With Soulsteel Shaper, a ghost
        can serve as a “trained thaumaturge” for the purposes of
        assisting an Exalt or other master craftsman in creating a
        soulsteel artifact, even if he lacks the necessary levels of
        Craft, Lore and Occult. See Savant and Sorcerer, Chapter
        Two, for details on assistants and crafting. Activation of
        this Arcanos simply allows the ghost to serve in this role
        during its duration on soulsteel projects. It does not enable
        him to assist with artifacts crafted from other substances.

        As the ghost artisan approaches master status, he
        gains the ability to modify relics that echo into the deadlands
        from the living world as part of a character’s Grave Goods
        Background. With this Arcanos, a ghost artisan can (slowly)
        transform a grave good into another form without changing
        its nature or magical Traits. The artisan cannot remove
        more than about 10 percent of the grave good’s mass if he
        wants it to retain any magical properties, nor can he add
        more than about 10 percent in new materials. For example,
        the artisan might transform a relic sword into a shield or a
        group of steel mugs. The transformed item remains composed
        of the same materials — a transformed sword remains
        mostly steel, a transformed chair mostly wood. If the relic
        is transformed into a group of items, those items only retain
        any magical properties when they are together. It takes
        seven days per dot of the Grave Goods Background to
        modify a relic in this fashion, which means that a ghost
        who wishes to change any potent grave good must be
        prepared to spend a great deal of Essence to do so.

        As the ghost artisan approaches master status, he gains
        the ability to modify soulsteel artifacts. With this Arcanos,
        a ghost artisan can (slowly) transform an artifact made
        mostly or entirely of soulsteel into another form without
        changing its nature or magical Traits. The artisan cannot
        remove more than about 10 percent of the artifact’s mass if
        he wants it to retain its magical properties, nor can he add
        more than about 10 percent in new materials. The artisan
        might transform a soulsteel suit of armor into a different sort
        of armor, for example, or a mated pair of swords.<br>
        Essentially, any purely physical transformation can be
        made that does not alter the item’s various artifact sub-ratings,
        such as Usefulness, Game Impact or Script
        Immunity, as per Savant and Sorcerer, Chapter Two. It is
        possible that the Storyteller will allow changes to the
        item’s Usefulness or Game Impact through this Charm,
        but changes to the item’s Power, Script Immunity and
        Essence Drawback are explicitly forbidden. If a single
        artifact is transformed into a group of items, those items
        only retain their magical properties when they are together.
        It takes seven days per dot of the Artifact Background
        to modify a soulsteel artifact in this fashion, which means
        that a ghost who wishes to change any potent artifact must
        be prepared to spend a great deal of Essence to do so.

        Given a quantity of raw soulsteel, a ghost-artisan with
        this Charm may help to forge it into a new artifact. Such
        an artifact lacks magical Traits beyond the standard abilities
        conveyed by soulsteel as a Magical Material (in the
        hands of an Abyssal Exalt, a soulsteel melee weapon gets
        +1 accuracy and drains Essence from the target when
        damage is done, while soulsteel armor gets +2 soak when
        attuned by an Abyssal, and so on — see Exalted, Chapter
        Nine, for details). Creation of the soulsteel item takes as
        long as it would take to craft an item out of ordinary steel
        in Creation, but this Arcanos must be activated every day
        in order to do so.

        While active, this Charm gives a ghost the same sense
        that a spectre has within the Labyrinth — the ability to
        more easily detect soulsteel veins within the stone of the
        Labyrinth itself. The player of the ghost using this Arcanos
        rolls Perception + Craft, and for every success, the ghost
        can aid in the search for soulsteel for one hour. This aid
        comes in the form of a -1 difficulty on any roll to find or
        mine soulsteel.
