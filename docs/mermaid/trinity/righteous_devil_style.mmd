        The character draws a breath and concentrates,
        extending her senses to feel the flow of Essence that
        unites her, her weapon and her target. In this perfect
        moment, the Exalt fires her weapon, and her firewand's
        tongue of flame seeks out her intended target with
        knowing assurance. For each mote of Essence the player
        spends, his player may add one die to any Martial Arts
        roll using a firewand or similar weapon. This added
        bonus cannot exceed the character's Dexterity + Martial
        Arts pool. Essence for this Charm must be spent
        prior to the attack roll.

        At this level, the character becomes more intimately
        aware of how Essence flows through her and her weapon
        and is able to dramatically increase the damage her weapon
        can do based on this understanding. As with Kiss of the
        Sun Concentration, the character draws a breath, concentrates
        and then fires her weapon. This time, however, the
        once thin stream of flame expands to twice its normal
        girth, spiraling out from its center like a blossoming peony
        of flame. The player activates the Charm and doubles the
        damage done on a successful Martial Arts attack using a
        firewand or some similar weapon. The bonus damage is
        applied before the target rolls to soak.

        Vibrant cobalt lightning crackles and coalesces about
        her forearm, and in one fluid motion, the Exalt readies
        her firewand and fires. The player spends 2 motes of
        Essence to invoke this Charm. Aside from the benefit of
        surprise, &quot;shooting from the hip&quot; enables the character to
        attack more quickly, adding 1 to her Initiative rating per
        point of her permanent Essence.

        By entering this meditative state, the Exalt becomes
        a conduit for the righteous fury of the sun itself.
        Her firewand blazes with an inner light as brilliant
        as daylight, and her attacks sear with the intensity
        of solar flares. For the duration of this Charm, all
        Martial Arts attacks made with a firewand or similar
        weapon ignore all armor and natural soak. In addition,
        the character adds her permanent Essence to the damage
        dealt by such attacks.<br>
        The player spends 2 motes of Essence for her character
        to invoke the blessing, and these motes are considered
        committed until the Exalt fires the weapon, releasing
        the charge. Add the character's permanent Essence to
        the base damage of the firewand or similar weapon when
        it is next fired.<br>
        If this Charm is used against creatures of the Un-
        derworld or Abyssal Exalted, the damage dealt is
        aggravated. If the Solar using this Charm also invokes
        Fire Blossom of Inevitable Demise, the bonus dice are
        added after the damage has been doubled. The in-
        creased damage dice gained with Blessing of Righteous
        Solar Spark Meditation cannot be doubled with Fire
        Blossom of Inevitable Demise Technique or any Charm
        that doubles base damage.<br>
        If the martial artist has multiple firewands, the
        Blessing of Righteous Solar Spark can only be invoked
        on one at a time, and if done in combat, it takes two
        turns to do so. Finally, if the Solar using a &quot;blessed
        firewand&quot; invokes an attack Charm that allows her to
        make multiple attacks, the bonus damage must be divided
        evenly among her targets.<br>
        Only Solar Exalted can use this particular Charm.

        Despite the superior damage capabilities of
        firewands, there are certain drawbacks to using them:
        the low availability and astronomical price of firedust,
        just to name a couple. Also, their temperamental nature
        and need for constant upkeep and repair make them
        difficult choices for use in the field. But perhaps the
        biggest difficulty in using firewands is that most flame-discharge
        weapons are single-shot ones. The martial
        artist must take a turn to reload a firewand after each
        shot. However, a Solar with this Charm is able to bypass
        this particular weakness.<br>
        After the character makes an attack with his weapon,
        the player may spend 1 mote for his character and make
        a Reflexive Wits + Martial Arts roll, difficulty 2. The
        character's hands move too fast for unExalted eyes to see,
        trailing translucent clouds of black firedust that waft
        about his torso. If the roll is successful, the Solar Exalted
        successfully reloads his weapon and can bring it to bear
        before his next action. If the roll fails, he is unable to load
        the weapon correctly. If he manages to botch, the Storyteller
        should feel free to use her twisted imagination to
        describe what happens when those black firedust clouds,
        from which the Charm gets its name, ignite about the
        martial artist's upper torso. A botch can be especially bad
        if the character is using a First Age weapon.

        The martial artist takes on an executioner's terrible
        stillness. Shadows seem to darken about his eyes and
        render his features gaunt, giving him an imposing,
        dreadful gaze. He is the fatal answer to the depraved and
        unjust, the retribution all who would defy Heaven knew
        must someday come. After activating this Charm, all
        extras who lay eyes on the martial artist will move
        unassumingly, as not to draw attention to themselves,
        yet swiftly for cover, pull their children inside and bolt
        their doors.<br>
        Targets of the martial artist within a radius equal
        to (the martial artist's Essence x 10) yards feel a sense
        of foreboding and are compelled to confront the mar-
        tial artist. Up until a target actually makes eye contact
        with the Exalt, her player must make a successful
        reflexive Willpower roll each turn with a difficulty
        equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence rating, or her
        character moves to confront the Exalt. Characters
        may spend a point of temporary Willpower to stop this
        compulsion. Once she has spent a turn engaged in
        combat or parley with the Exalt, this effect ends for the
        remainder of the scene.

        With this Charm, a martial artist can extend the
        range of his weapon. Upon activating this Charm, a
        halo of gold and cobalt light encircles the tip of the
        firewand's barrel. When the character pulls the trigger,
        six golden swan wings, each the length of a woman's
        forearm, gracefully spiral out of the halo and speed the
        tongue of flame to its extended target. The player
        spends 1 mote of Essence, and her character can make
        a Martial Arts attack using her firewand or similar
        weapon at twice its normal range.

        The martial artist using this Charm draws a controlled,
        deep breath and holds it. She extends her senses
        to perceive the ebb and flow of Essence that permeates
        the world around her. As she concentrates, the tenuous
        connections that tie her and her weapon to her target
        become glaringly apparent to her. At this point, she can
        close her eyes, for she need not see her target to strike it.
        Her Caste Mark flares and pulses with the beating of her
        own heart. At the same moment, a series of notched rings
        of silvery azure light encircle her target. They are of
        varying widths, numbering between three and nine in
        total, and rotate around the target at odd angles, some
        spinning clockwise, while others spin widdershins.<br>
        This is the Azure Abacus. In the days of the First Age,
        this Charm was an artful meditation of the most introspec-
        tive and intimate — and, some considered, prideful —
        nature, for it measured, some believed, a soul's nature,
        existence and importance in the grand scope of Creation.
        Unfortunately, in this dark Age, the knowledge of how to
        glean any pertinent information from such a display is
        completely lost, even to the martial artist invoking this
        Charm. If there are any alive who remember how to gauge
        the delicate nuances of the Azure Abacus, they are not
        sharing the information.<br>
        Upon reaching this harmonious state, the Exalt invoking
        this Charm fires her weapon, and her shot zeros in
        on her target, trailing a brilliant comet's tail of flaming
        Essence. As the fireball closes in on its target, this ancient
        accounting begins to solve itself. The rings begin to align,
        starting with the innermost, and quickly rectify them-
        selves a hairbreadth moment before the martial artist's
        attack hits. In this perfect moment just before the Exalt's
        attack strikes the middle of the Abacus, time slows to an
        immeasurable halt.<br>
        The martial artist's target perceives the rectified rings
        about him shift their shape. A chorus of aquiline, cobalt
        cherubim, three to nine risers deep and awash in silver and
        golden flames begin to sing. The melody resonates at a very
        intimate level with the target, matching the harmonic
        frequency of his soul. Such a display can be very unsettling
        to those not prepared for it, and the players of those
        subjected must make a successful reflexive Willpower roll,
        difficulty 2, for their characters to do anything other than
        stare or scream in shocked terror as inescapable retribution
        comes calling. The martial artist spends 4 motes of Essence
        and one Willpower. So long as the target stays within the
        firing range of the martial artist's weapon, the attack cannot
        miss. Even if the character can move, the attack cannot be
        dodged by any means and can only be parried if the target has
        Charms that enable him to parry insubstantial attacks.

        Martial artists knowledgeable of this Charm are deadly
        foes, especially in close quarters, with little to hide behind.
        Upon firing his weapon, the bolt of flame spits from the
        end of the barrel only to come to a shrieking halt a yard
        from the barrel-end of the firewand and, with a thunderous
        clap, explodes into a small winged creature that howls,

        first target. If the roll succeeds, he may immediately make

        base damage of the martial artist's weapon.

        like bellows stoking a furnace. With each breath,
        she channels Essence through her weapon, using it as her
        focus. The Exalt can then fire a bolt of gossamer golden
        flame from his flamewand rather than needing firedust. So

        running out of ammunition again.

        A master of this style has an acute and profound
        understanding into the nature of Essence. The invisible
        matrix of divine energy that tethers all of Creation into
        one whole, where concepts of space and distance do not
        exist, becomes evident and accessible to her.<br>
        When invoking this Charm, the martial artist attunes
        herself to the ambient lines of Essence, pulling them
        through her and focusing and filtering these energies
        through her righteous will. Essence trails can momentarily
        be seen radiating around her Caste Mark, tongues of
        Celestial fire and lightning writhe about her head and
        shoulders. The Exalt fires her weapon, and an Essence-
        enriched deluge of cobalt-and gold-flame engulfs her target.
        Any flammable items within the Exalt's Essence in yards
        around the target is incinerated to ash within seconds. The
        damage of the attack is aggravated, and the target is
        engulfed in flames for a number of turns equal to the Exalt's
        permanent Essence.<br>
        After soaking the initial damage, the target's player
        must then make a reflexive Stamina + Resistance roll,
        difficulty 3, for his character. If the roll is successful, the
        target suffers a penalty equal to the martial artist's permanent
        Essence rating to all dice pools. If the roll fails, then
        the target can do nothing but writhe around on the
        ground in agony. The victim's player must make a Stamina
        + Resistance roll as a reflexive action every turn his
        character remains aflame in order to continue acting. For
        each turn the target remains on fire, he must soak the base
        damage of the martial artist's weapon. This damage is not
        aggravated. Also, his player must reroll the Stamina +
        Resistance roll at an additional + 1 difficulty for each turn
        after the first.
