        The character begins the fan dance by unfurling her
        fan, causing it to ripple and spin in a distracting fashion.
        The Exalt's movements become as graceful and unpredictable
        as peach blossoms caught in a strong gust of
        wind. Those opposing the Exalt who are trying to strike
        her must add her Essence score to the difficulty when
        making an attack.

        The Exalt channels her Essence into her robes,
        fortifying them against damage. Her clothing and accoutrements
        take on an iridescent sheen, and shimmering
        golden motes of Essence waft and rise off of her person.
        The character cannot spend more motes of Essence to
        fuel this Charm than she has in her permanent Essence
        rating. Each mote spent adds 1L/2B to the character's
        soak. This bonus does not count as armor, but is, instead
        a form of natural soak.

        With this Charm, the Exalt imbues her props with
        lethal Essence. In the hands of the martial artist, a delicate
        paper fan can cut like a mighty scimitar. Despite the
        Charm's name, these benefits can also be applied to other
        items as well. The character can treat all paper fans and
        other similar props such as brushes and mirrors as wind-fire
        wheels. All sashes, long hems, sleeves and so on can be
        treated as seven-section staves. The damage inflicted with
        these weapons is lethal. This does not change the appearance
        of the item thus imbued, just it's damage potential.
        The sash will remain it's flowing silken self, and a fan will
        still look like a fan.<br>
        In addition, if the character is using a fan or other
        accouterment properly-constructed for use in the martial
        arts, Upon activating this Charm, the character may
        increase the accuracy, parry, speed or damage bonus of
        her weapon (pick any one at activation) by her permanent
        Essence score.

        <br>
        As the martial artist affects the demure and sensual
        dance of the Pearl Courtesan, her accoutrements and
        robes take on a life of their own, enhancing and
        complimenting her movements. At her command, her
        fans unfurl and ripple enticingly about her body. Her
        sashes swirl in a coy serpentine dance, and her flowing
        sleeves and gossamer robes unfold and gather at her
        whim. The Exalt does not have to manually control these
        props in order to allow for this effect. They do so auto-
        matically, leaving her hands free.<br>
        Upon activating this Charm, the martial artist can
        control one prop per dot in her permanent Essence score.
        For example, an Exalt with an Essence score of 4 can
        control one fan, one sash, one of her flowing sleeves and
        the hem of her cloak, or she could control four fans at once.
        Which props the Exalt intends to command must be
        decided before the activation of this Charm. If the martial
        artist wishes to add or change a prop, she must drop the
        present invocation of this form and reactivate it at the
        beginning of the next turn.<br>
        Objects the martial artist wishes to command must be
        on her person. Also, she cannot make an attack with these
        props unless she is manually controlling them. To do so
        and leave her hands free requires her to use the Flurry of
        August Leaves Concentration Charm. While this form is
        active, the Exalt's player may add her character's Martial
        Arts to all Presence and Socialize rolls. Characters cannot
        use more than one Form-type Charm at a time.

        At this level, the fan dancer has an acute understanding
        of spatial awareness and how the supple flows of air
        currents can affect the &quot;play&quot; of lighter materials such as
        silk and paper. Armed with this knowledge, the martial
        artist can use her props to surprising effect at range. The
        Exalt casts her fan or sash into the air. At her command it
        flicks and swoops toward it's intended target before spinning
        obediently back to her. If this Charm is activated
        while the martial artist is using the Dreaming Pearl Courtesan
        Form, she can command up to the number of props
        allowed by that Charm to make multiple attacks against
        one target. This Charm allows the martial artist to strike
        a target up to (Martial Arts x 5) yards away.<br>
        The Exalt makes a single attack with her Martial Arts
        pool, as usual, regardless of how many weapons she is
        controlling. Successes from the roll are applied to all
        weapons, and the damage is determined using her Strength
        as if were a normal Martial Arts attack. This attack can be
        parried or dodged like a normal Martial Arts attack, and
        the target's player need only make one roll for his character
        to parry or dodge this effect. Botched attacks can result in
        broken or lost props or injury to the martial artist who cast
        them. She must pay the cost of this Charm for each prop
        she wishes to command. Also, this Charm can only be used
        on props that can be separated from the Exalt's body. For
        example, she cannot use her cape while it's still tied around
        her neck. However, props in the grips of the Dreaming
        Pearl Courtesan form are considered explicitly &quot;in-hand&quot;
        for the purposes of this Charm.

        With this Charm, the Exalt is able to use her flowing
        garments with a prehensile dexterity to grapple opponents
        and their weapons. After successfully dodging or otherwise
        negating an enemy's attack, the Exalt's player may make a
        reflexive Dexterity + Martial Arts roll to have her
        character's skirt, cloak or flowing sleeves move to snare her
        opponents weapon or fist.<br>
        The martial artist must score as many successes as her
        opponent did on his attack to make a successful grapple.
        The defender may evade this only with Charms or by
        splitting his dice pool. If her opponent is using a weapon
        and the martial artist scores successes equal to or higher
        than her opponent's Melee, Martial Arts or Brawl score,
        the character has the option of disarming the target rather
        than clinching him.<br>
        After successfully clinching her enemy, the martial
        artist enters into a resisted roll against her opponent using
        her Dexterity + Martial Arts dice pool against his Strength
        + Brawl, Melee or Martial Arts dice pool. The rules for
        clinching still apply. If the Exalt is using the Dreaming
        Pearl Courtesan Form when this Charm is activated, she
        may make as many of these reflexive grapples as allowed by
        that form Charm. The cost of this Charm must be spent for
        each reflexive grapple the Exalt wishes to make.

        There is a saying that the most vicious fights are the
        ones between siblings or lovers. The person who knows
        someone the most intimately can circumvent his defenses
        and hurt him the most deeply. It is in the spirit of this
        aphorism that this technique was developed.<br>
        Most armor only covers the vital areas of the body,
        leaving the hardier or less lethal areas uncovered. Even
        superheavy plate is donned and removed in pieces: the
        helm, the back and shoulder guards, the breastplate, the
        greaves and leggings, etc. It is a testament to the smith's
        craft if the seams between the different pieces are too
        narrow for an arrow or blade to pierce. Paper and silk,
        however, are thinner than even the sharpest blade, and in
        the hands of a martial artist using this Charm, can be used
        to deadly effect. Upon activating this Charm, the Exalt
        negates points of her opponent's armor soak equal to her
        Essence + Martial Arts. This does not negate her target's
        natural soak or any bonuses gained through the use of
        Charms, merely his armor.

        As the Exalt performs the fluid and languid moves of
        the Fragrant Petal Fascination Kata, hundreds of glowing
        flower petals flow out of her sleeves and the folds of her
        robes and spiral about her. The players of all those within
        the Exalt's Essence in yards must succeed in a resisted
        Willpower roll against her player, or their characters are
        transfixed in place, enraptured by the beauty of the kata
        and perfume of the petals. Even those whose players
        succeed in the roll find themselves subjected to a hallucinogenic
        vertigo, as if in a waking dream, and suffer a
        penalty to all dice pools equal to the Exalt's Essence while
        in the range of the Charm.<br>
        Those entranced by this Charm are highly susceptible
        to suggestion and will believe whatever the Exalt
        tells them to be truthful. Also, the Exalt can issue
        commands to those enraptured and, unless the orders are
        suicidal, expect them to be followed. These suggestive
        effects, however, do not effect those with a higher permanent
        Essence rating than the martial artist. If for any
        reason the Exalt halts her kata, or the scene ends, the
        fascination begins to wear off. The effects linger for a
        number of turns equal to the martial artist's Essence.
        During this period of reduced effects, the victims suffer a
        dice-pool penalty equal to the Exalt's Essence. Those
        thus enraptured will have vague memories of what transpired
        while under the effects of this Charm and will
        suffer a strange melancholia, adding +1 difficulty to
        Conviction rolls made for them for a number of days
        equal to the Exalt's Essence.

        It is believed by the masters of this style that all
        things in Creation are expressions of duality, a marriage
        of form and the infinitely possible, and that all sentient
        creatures experience this potential from the safety of
        their dreams. Here, desires are laid bare, wishes are
        fulfilled, and nightmares stalk those unwilling to confront
        their inner demons. The savants of this style argue
        that a person's dreams are not a phenomenon unique to
        an individual, but instead &quot;The Dreaming,&quot; as they refer
        to this collective subconsciousness, is a commonality.
        All sentient creatures share and are a part of it. Here,
        they may touch the infinite, however briefly, without
        fear of losing sight of the singularity that is their &quot;self.&quot;
        Masters of this style seek to achieve a perfect waking
        and lucid union of this dual principle. With this Charm,
        they are briefly able to breach this threshold and achieve
        its perfect form, the mighty Chimera. The martial artist
        opens herself to this same collective consciousness and
        transcends, assuming the form of this fell and beautiful
        creature. A pillar of swirling light shines down upon the
        Exalt. Her clothing and accoutrements disappear as her
        form becomes long and sinewy, growing to five times
        her normal height. Her neck extends up to four feet in
        length and supports her delicate and golden beaked
        foal's head. She is crowned with four sets of gazelle's
        horns that whip and spiral, reshaping themselves like
        tendrils of smoke. Eyes ranging from the size of small
        pearls to the size of goose eggs line either side of her
        narrow snout and continue down her back, collecting in
        shifting patterns by the hundreds, blazing like sapphires
        in the noonday sun, blinking demurely.<br>
        The Exalt's entire form is covered with gold-veined
        pearl scales, which afford her an additional 6L/12B
        armor. Instead of arms or legs, the martial artist gains a
        pair of four-foot-wide, barbed carp's fins for every point
        of her permanent Essence, which can strike for Strength
        +3 damage and enable her to hover in or swim through
        the air with serpentine grace at 45 miles per hour. While
        using this Charm, the Exalt cannot be surprised or lied
        to, as secrets echo like the whispers of wind chimes
        between her coils and opponents' intentions play out
        like gossamer filigree about her. Also, the Exalt has a
        number of actions per turn equal to her Essence. These
        are full extra actions, the martial artist may split her
        dice pools, and this effect is incompatible with other
        extra actions effects.<br>
        There is, however, a certain risk involved when
        Invoking the Chimera's Coils. The Exalt experiences an
        ecstatic bliss while in this form, and if she is not careful,
        she will forget that she once was mortal and lose herself
        to the collective knowledge of humanity's dreams, remain
        transcendent and pass out of this realm of existence.
        This Charm lasts for as long as the Exalt wishes, and she
        must spend a point of temporary Willpower to end it. For
        every scene after the first she remains in this form, she
        must make a Willpower roll at an additional + 1 difficulty.
        If at any time she fails this roll, she disappears in a
        blinding flash of pearlescent light. The Exalted have lost
        some of their mightiest martial artists in this way. Once
        thus transcended, none ever return.
