        Essence Bite<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 3 motes<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Valor: 3<br>
        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        The spirit must touch its target for this Charm to
        work, requiring a successful Dexterity + Brawl or Martial
        Arts roll. If the touch attempt is successful, make a
        reflexive Valor + Essence roll for the spirit. For every
        success on the attack, the spirit does a point of lethal
        damage. The character's armor soak applies as normal to
        this damage, and extra successes on the attack roll add to
        damage as usual.<br>
        This Charm may rely on heat, cold, life-draining or
        any number of other mechanisms to do damage â€”
        almost all have secondary effects that the spirit can
        manipulate to its advantage. For example, a ghost that
        can start fires with its fiery touch can burn down a barn
        with this Charm.

        Materialize<br>
        <br>
        Cost: Varies<br>
        Duration: Indefinite<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Through the use of this Charm, the spirit can materialize
        in the physical world. The cost of this Charm is between 50
        percent and 100 percent of the spirit's temporary Essence.
        The cost varies from spirit to spirit and is listed in the spirit's
        description or assigned by the Storyteller. Generally, as the
        power of the spirit grows, the spirit must expend proportionally
        greater amounts of Essence to materialize.
        In most cases, a spirit that plans to meddle in mortal
        affairs will materialize in some safe area and then rest,
        regaining its Essence, before it goes about its business. Spirits
        that have not materialized cannot affect the physical world, not
        with Charms, physical attacks or in any other fashion.

        Principle of Motion<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Until used<br>
        Type: Extra Action<br>

        When the spirit uses this Charm, it gains a pool of extra
        actions equal to its Valor. Actions in this pool can be expended
        for extra attacks on the spirit's initiative or reflexively, to parry or
        dodge an attack or to refresh the spirit's Dodge pool when using
        the full dodge maneuver. If the spirit does not use all the actions
        in its pool, they remain available for it in the following turn.
        Actions in the pool will persist for many months, and many spirits
        make sure they retain a full complement of actions in case they
        are ambushed. A spirit cannot use this Charm again until it has
        used up all the extra actions granted by the last use of the Charm.
        While the spirit has extra actions in its pool, the motes of Essence
        used to power this Charm are considered committed.

        Words of Power<br>

        The spirit may intone blasphemies, keen out the lamentations
        of the dead or speak the victim's true name, but
        regardless, its words are like a battering ram. The spirit attacks
        using Charisma + Valor to hit the opponent and does bashing
        damage equal to the spirit's Strength, which can be soaked
        only by the target's Stamina. Extra successes on the attack add
        to damage, as usual. For every health level of damage the
        target takes, he is at a - 1 penalty to all dice pools for a number
        of turns equal to the attacking spirit's Essence.
        This attack may be dodged or blocked as normal but
        has no physical effects except perhaps causing blood to
        flow from the target's ears or hurling him bodily through
        light obstructions.
