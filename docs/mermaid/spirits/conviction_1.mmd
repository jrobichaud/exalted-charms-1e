        Through the use of this Charm, the spirit can create mental
        illusions that only the target can see. To do it, roll the spirit's
        Manipulation + Conviction. The first success creates the illusion,
        while additional successes make the illusion more difficult to
        penetrate. The target's player must make an Intelligence + Temperance
        roll and must gain a number of successes at least equal to
        the number of successes the spirit rolled. If not, the target is unable
        to tell the illusion from reality. He may make additional Intelligence
        + Temperance rolls whenever the illusion departs wildly
        from what the target expects from reality, making believable
        illusions much more difficult to see through. Once the illusion has
        been penetrated, it is dispelled, and all further uses of the Charm
        on that being are at + 1 difficulty for the next several days.

        Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction in an extended
        resisted action against the target's Willpower. When the spirit
        gains more successes than the victim has temporary Willpower,
        the spirit takes possession of the target for the rest of the scene.
        Successes accumulate for the duration of the scene. More
        powerful versions of this Charm exist, which allow spirits to
        &quot;hollow out&quot; a being's soul and possess him indefinitely.

        The spirit channels Essence into the victim to inflame her
        emotional state. One success merely aggravates whatever
        condition is already present, while three or more successes
        cause the target to completely lose herself in the emotion of the
        moment. You may roll no more dice that the spirit's Convic-
        tion. Used against one of the Exalted, this Charm causes the
        character's Limit to increase by one point per success.

        The spirit channels Essence into the target to alter his
        emotional state, instilling within him a desire to obey the
        spirit. Roll the spirit's Charisma + Conviction with a
        difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Simple success
        merely makes the target slightly more likely to obey, while
        three successes forces him to obey completely unless such
        obedience would cause him physical harm. At five successes,
        the target does anything the spirit commands.

        Prerequisite Charms: Instill Obedience<br>
        This Charm allows a spirit to lay a Geas, or bond, upon
        a target. It requires eye contact and a successful Manipulation
        + Conviction check, with at least three successes,
        The spirit may order the target to perform one task, which
        may include such broad orders as &quot;serve me for one month.&quot;
        The spirit may not order the target to do something that
        would directly harm the target, but it may order him to
        attempt a difficult or dangerous goal as long as there is a
        reasonable chance of success (Storyteller's discretion).
        This Charm has a minimum cost of 15 motes, even if it is
        to last only one day. This Geas does not completely govern
        the target's actions; rather, it gives the target a compulsion
        to work toward the task he has been given. For each day
        that the target fails to work in good faith toward the task,
        he loses one temporary Willpower and takes one health
        level of aggravated damage. For each two days spent
        working in good faith toward the task, he regains one
        health level lost from for disobeying the Geas.

        The target of this Charm finds herself in an illusory
        world of the spirit's design. The illusion is total and covers
        all senses — according to all of her senses, the target has
        been transported elsewhere. The illusion has a nearly
        instant duration but may appear to last tor up to one day to
        the mind of the target.<br>
        This Charm requires the spirit to touch its target (a
        nonreflexive Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts roll if she's
        actively evading) or look in her eyes. The spirit may use
        this effect on multiple people at once, but all of them must
        find themselves in the same illusion, and the spirit must
        touch all of them at once.<br>
        Any damage the target takes within the hallucination
        is purely illusory. However, if the target dies within the
        illusion, then her player must succeed on a Stamina +
        Resistance roll or fall into a coma for one day per point of
        the spirit's Essence (or longer, at the Storyteller's discretion,

            As the Possession spirit Charm, roll the spirit's Manipulation

            temporary Willpower, then the initial possession succeeds. As
            long as the spirit occupies the victim, temporary Willpower
            cannot he regained. The possessing spirit must relinquish con-
            trol of the victims body at least once per week, though it isn't
            necessary to abandon the victim. The spirit must make the
            attempt to regain control of the victim by repeating the initial
            possession roll. After each month of possession, the victim loses
            one point of Willpower permanently. If a spirit fails in its attempt
            to regain control of its victim, the spirit is expelled, and the
            victim cannot be possessed by that spirit again.

            This Charm allows a spirit to possess someone indefinitely,
            riding them as if the host's body were its own
            and laying the groundwork for a true fusion of spirit and
            mortal form. In order for this Charm to work, the potential
            vessel must consent to the spirit's possessing him.
            Otherwise, it does not function and the spirit must rely
            on cruder Charms, such as Soul Rapt. The results of the
            Charm depend on the difference in the Essence of the
            host and the possessing spirit. If the spirit's Essence
            exceeds the host's by three or more, the host acquires the
            spirit's Traits (both Attributes and Abilities). If the
            host's Essence exceeds the spirit's by three or more, the
            spirit acquires the host's Traits. If the Essence of host and
            spirit are within two points of one another, a true fusion
            is achieved in which the combined entity has the average
            of the Traits of both halves, rounded up. The fusion also
            acquires the average of the spirit and the subject's temporary
            Essence after subtracting the 20 motes needed to
            trigger the Charm. If the being is an Exalt, add all
            temporary Essence together before determining the average
            — the result of a god synthesis with an Exalt has only
            Peripheral Essence. In addition, it has access to one of the
            god's Charms per point of total permanent Essence.
            These Charms cannot include Dematerialize.<br>
            This Charm is exceedingly rare outside of Rathess, the
            surrounding regions and other backwaters. Gods and spirits
            hailing from regions close to the Realm generally avoid
            using it, out of fear that the Immaculates would notice and
            take offense. The Immaculate Philosophy's adherents consider
            use of this Charm a grave blasphemy and take harsh
            measures to suppress its continued use. If the host is slain,
            the spirit reforms in one-third the normal time, and the
            spirit will never lose its individual identity as a result. If the
            host is killed using Charms that have the effect of slaying
            a spirit forever (as with Ghost-Eating Technique) the
            spirit and the host's higher soul are both destroyed. Spirits
            using this Charm are not constantly drained the way those
            who simply create bodies for themselves out of Essence
            through the use of the Materialize Charm are.

            This Charm allows a spirit to utterly destroy the soul
            of a being it is riding, thereby creating a host lacking the
            ability to regain control. The spirit rider may then use the
            body as a host at will or vacate it, during which time it
            assumes a comatose state until either the spirit returns or
            the vessel is destroyed. To attempt to use this Charm, the
            spirit must be in contact with the target. Make an extended
            roll of Conviction + Essence against the target's
            Willpower + Essence, one roll per activation of the Charm.
            If the spirit accumulates successes equal to the target's
            Essence, he succeeds, destroying the victim's soul permanently.
            Failing at any point in this process casts out the
            spirit, who may never again attempt to use this Charm
            against the same would-be host.<br>
            A soulless body retains all its Physical Attributes
            (Strength, Dexterity and Stamina), which the spirit may
            either use as they were before hollowing out the soul or
            augment with its own Attributes (if higher). However, its
            Mental and Social Attributes cease to exist. The body now
            uses its spirit rider's Attributes in these areas, as well all of
            its other characteristics (such as Willpower, Essence, Abilities,
            Charms, etc.). Such a body is indeed little more than
            an empty vessel, and the spirit primarily gains the ability
            to manifest in a particular physical form on a permanent
            basis — a valuable ability in some cases.<br>
            A body without a soul lasts only two weeks before it
            begins to show signs of physical corruption, becoming
            useless to the spirit after an additional week. This decay
            may be staved off by the commitment of 2 additional motes
            of Essence per day, each infusion pushing back the start of
            the two-week period. All Essence spent activating the
            Charm remains committed until the host body decays.
