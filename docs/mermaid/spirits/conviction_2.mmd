        Confusion<br>

        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction with a
        difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Simple success or
        one extra success indicates that the target is mildly confused.
        He might confuse one direction along a path with
        another. Two or three extra successes indicate that the
        target is quite confused. He might believe that traveling
        after dark in the woods without a lantern is a perfectly
        reasonable thing to do. Four or more extra successes
        indicate that the target is completely addled and may well
        do something very dangerous. He could try to scale a cliff
        face in the dark or go to sleep in a bear's den. Fair Folk are
        immune to this power.

        Memory Mirror<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>

        The spirit must touch its target in order to employ this
        Charm (normal Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts check).
        If successful, roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction
        with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. The more
        successes, the more of the target's memories the spirit
        absorbs. This may temporarily befuddle the target, but
        Memory Mirror does not actually remove the target's
        memories, just duplicates them. With a simple success, the
        spirit obtains only the most basic details: profession, name
        and any major life events. Four or more extra successes
        indicate near-total memor; absorption.

        Prerequisite Charms: Memory Mirror<br>
        <br>
        This Charm works like Memory Mirror, except that
        the memories are drained out of the target as they enter the
        spirit's mind. Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction
        with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. The more
        successes the spirit achieves, the fewer details the target
        remembers, until only the smallest details remain. Four or
        more extra successes indicate that the target suffers from
        near-total amnesia. The memories have actually been
        removed and cannot be recovered through association or
        prompting.

        Memory Transference<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 15 motes, 2 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>

        Minimum Essence: 4<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Memory Sponge<br>
        <br>
        This Charm allows a spirit to transfer memories between
        two subjects. The spirit must be able to touch both
        subjects at once, and if they are evading, the spirit must
        succeed on a Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts roll. This
        is not a reflexive attack, and if the spirit is attempting to
        touch both targets in the same turn it activates the Charm,
        split its dice pool at least three ways.
        After the spirit touches the targets, roll its Manipulation
        + Conviction with a difficult equal to the higher of the
        two target's Essences. The memories are moved from one
        subject to another, not copied. The spirit gets a vague idea
        of the shape of the memories - enough to identify blocks
        of them and figure out what should be moved. The spirit
        remembers only vague details afterward, not specifics.
        The more successes on the roll, the more precisely the
        spirit can identify and choose what to move, and the more
        it can move. Simple success allows the movement of a few
        random memories, three successes allows large, important
        memories, and five or more extra successes allow the spirit
        to transfer an entire lifetime's worth of memories, or just a
        single dark and hidden secret. Note that the transfer is one
        way â€” a spirit that wishes to swap two personalities
        between bodies has to roll five or more extra success on two
        uses of the Charm.

        Dreambane<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 15 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Reflexive<br>
        Minimum Conviction: 3<br>
        Minimum Essence: 6<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Dreamscape<br>
        <br>
        This Charm acts exactly as the Compassion Charm
        Dreamscape, except that the roll made is Manipulation +
        Conviction, and any harm done to the target within the
        dream has a chance of leaking through to the target's physical
        body (as either bashing or lethal damage, as appropriate).<br>
        If the target takes damage in the dream, her player must
        make a reflexive Wits roll to see how much slips through to
        harm the character's real body. For every success on the wits
        roll, one health level is subtracted from the damage that the
        character took in the hallucination before it is applied to her
        real body. The character can never take more damage to her
        real body from a single event in the hallucination than the
        Essence of the spirit that used Dreambane on her.<br>
        Each time damage gets through the soak roll, the
        target's player may make a Willpower roll. With three or
        more successes, the character wakes up. The player must
        also succeed a Willpower roll if the character takes enough
        damage to kill her in the dream before she wakes up. If the
        roll botches, the character dies (if mortal) or enters a coma
        for one week per point of the spirit's Essence (if Exalted).
        If the roll fails, the character wakes up at Incapacitated and
        must heal normally. If the roll succeeds, she wakes up with
        only one additional health level of bashing damage. This
        Charm may only be used on one target at a time.
