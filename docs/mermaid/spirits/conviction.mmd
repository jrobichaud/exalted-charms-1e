        Harrow the Mind<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Through the use of this Charm, the spirit can create mental
        illusions that only the target can see. To do it, roll the spirit's
        Manipulation + Conviction. The first success creates the illusion,
        while additional successes make the illusion more difficult to
        penetrate. The target's player must make an Intelligence + Temperance
        roll and must gain a number of successes at least equal to
        the number of successes the spirit rolled. If not, the target is unable
        to tell the illusion from reality. He may make additional Intelligence
        + Temperance rolls whenever the illusion departs wildly
        from what the target expects from reality, making believable
        illusions much more difficult to see through. Once the illusion has
        been penetrated, it is dispelled, and all further uses of the Charm
        on that being are at + 1 difficulty for the next several days.

        Cost: 3 motes, 1 Willpower
        Duration: One scene
        Type: Simple
        Minimum Conviction: 4
        Minimum Essence: 1
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction in an extended
        resisted action against the target's Willpower. When the spirit
        gains more successes than the victim has temporary Willpower,
        the spirit takes possession of the target for the rest of the scene.
        Successes accumulate for the duration of the scene. More
        powerful versions of this Charm exist, which allow spirits to
        &quot;hollow out&quot; a being's soul and possess him indefinitely.

        The spirit channels Essence into the victim to inflame her
        emotional state. One success merely aggravates whatever
        condition is already present, while three or more successes
        cause the target to completely lose herself in the emotion of the
        moment. You may roll no more dice that the spirit's Convic-
        tion. Used against one of the Exalted, this Charm causes the
        character's Limit to increase by one point per success.
