        This power enables the spirit to sense nearby Essence,
        whether it exists in objects or within Exalted. Rolls the
        spirit's Perception + Compassion. One success is enough to
        sense Essence in the vaguest of measures. Three or more
        successes means the spirit not only senses Essence, but
        knows its source and potential powers (if possessed by
        Exalted, for example).

        For each success on the roll, the spirit may improve an
        individual's Stamina by one dot. More dice than the
        spirit's Charisma + Compassion may not be rolled, nor may
        the spirit increase the target's Stamina by more dots than
        the spirit's Essence. Only one use of this Charm may be
        active on an individual at any given time. This Charm
        fades at a rate of one dot per (the spirit's Willpower) turns.

        The spirit may heal itself or others. Spends the 3
        motes of Essence and make a Compassion roll. If the roll
        succeeds, the Charm heals one health level of bashing or
        lethal damage.

        This Charm enables the spirit to get a feel for how
        things are going within its domain of influence (up to a half
        mile in diameter per point of Essence, but most often related
        to a geographical feature â€” for instance, a single tree and a
        little land surrounding it might be a spirit's area of influence).
        Roll the spirit's Perception + Compassion. One
        success allows the spirit to sense the presence of any direct
        and immediate danger (to itself or to the domain) in the
        area. Two successes allow a reasonably thorough catalogue
        of the influences at work in the area and the intentions they
        have with regard to the spirit or its domain. Three or more
        successes allows the spirit to know almost anything currently
        going on within its domain that isn't protected by some sott
        of supernatural ward or misdirection. Charms, sorcery and
        exceptional Ability rolls or stunts may block this insight or
        remove successes, at the Storyteller's discretion. Some spir-
        its that have no natural domain may be able to use this ability
        in any area they've spent several days exploring (Storyteller's
        discretion; two additional successes required).
