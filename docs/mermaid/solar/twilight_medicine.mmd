        Body-Mending Meditation<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 10 motes<br>
        Duration: One day<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>

        <br>
        This Charm allows the character to channel Essence
        through her own body, knitting broken bones and mending
        cut and burnt flesh with supernatural speed. When this
        Charm is active, the character heals at 10 times the normal
        rate. For healing times, see the Drama chapter, page 234. This
        Charm works only on the Exalted herself and cannot be used
        on others. This Charm does not speed the healing of aggravated
        damage, nor does it allow the regeneration of amputated
        or destroyed tissue â€” a character who loses an eye or hand will
        have to seek more powerful magical remedies. Characters can
        activate this Charm even if unconscious.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character hones
        his medical abilities to an unearthly degree. By examining
        a patient closely and hearing about her symptoms, the
        character can flawlessly diagnose her illness. Note that this
        is an improvement of the character's perception, not
        access to a vast store of medical wisdom - knowledge of
        formal medicine is a function of the character's Medicine
        and Lore skills. If the character has never heard of a disease,
        she will only be able to diagnose its general type and
        determine if it is magical in nature or not. The character's
        ability to actually treat the disease will be strictly contingent
        on her skill as a physician. However, regardless of her
        degree of skill, she will never misdiagnose a disease, mis-
        taking one she doesn't know for one she does.

        The Charm Ailment-Rectifying Method allows an
        Exalted to recover rapidly from even the most serious
        illness. Non-life-threatening illnesses dissipate immediately.
        The player of a character suffering from a more
        serious ailment may make a Stamina + Resistance roll
        (without any wound or disease-related penalties). Success
        indicates that the character's illness fades over the
        course of the Charm's duration. Very serious diseases may
        require two or more successes, so it may take a character
        several days of use to accumulate enough successes to
        recover fully. However, even the most serious illnesses
        are halted in their progress by this Charm, and even the
        Great Contagion requires but five accumulated successes
        to overcome. Note that this Charm can only be used on
        the Exalted herself - to heal others of sickness, the
        Exalted must use Contagion-Curing Touch.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character can
        successfully treat serious or even normally incurable diseases.
        The Exalted's player makes an Intelligence +
        Medicine roll. Normal diseases are cured with a single
        success, while more serious ailments may require as many
        as five successes. Regardless of success, once treatment has
        begun, the course of the disease is halted, and unless use of
        this Charm is discontinued, the illness will grow no worse.
        No medicine is required, though the person being treated
        must be bathed, kept warm, fed well and given all the other
        prerequisites of bed rest. The Exalted himself must perform
        this care and, as a result, cannot treat more individuals
        during a given day than his score in the Medicine Ability.

        The Touch of Blissful Release allows the character to
        lessen the suffering of wounded or ill individuals, dulling
        their pains and easing the discomforts of illness. Wounded
        characters reduce their wound penalties by two, and sick
        characters likewise ignore up to two dice of negative
        symptoms. However, Touch of Blissful Release has a
        narcotic effect as well as an analgesic one, and characters
        under its influence are at a -3 die penalty to performing any
        action that requires thought, memory or coordination.

        By channeling Essence through her body, the character
        can increase her rate of healing immensely. Over the
        duration of the Charm, which must be spent in bed rest,
        the character heals health levels equal to her Essence score
        plus a number of additional health levels equal to the
        number of successes the character's player achieves on a
        Stamina + Endurance roll. This Charm does not speed the

        of amputated or destroyed tissue.

        plus a number of additional levels equal to the number of
        successes her player achieves on an Intelligence + Medicine
        roll. A character cannot tend to more than one
        individual undergoing Wound-Mending Care Technique
        at a time. This Charm does not speed the healing of
        aggravated damage, nor does it allow the regeneration of

        herself with this Charm. This Charm does not speed the

        The character enters a healing trance, during which he
        loses all awareness of the world around him. For every hour
        he is in this trance, he heals a number of health levels equal
        to his Essence score. This healing trance will cure aggravated
        damage, as well as allow the regrowth of destroyed
        tissues, amputated limbs, lost eyes and so forth. Eyes, tongues,
        hands, feet, mouths full of smashed teeth and other lesser
        maimings are the equivalent of a health level. Lost limbs are
        the equivalent of two health levels and, so, take two hours
        each to regrow. During the period the Exalted is so entranced,
        she regains no Essence - prolonged periods of
        healing can leave a Solar helpless before her enemies.

        Similar to the Charm Bodily Regeneration Prana, the
        Healing Trance Meditation Charm allows the character to
        heal similarly serious injuries in others. The Exalted must
        touch her target, and the target must be cooperative. Both
        she and the target fall into a healing trance, during which
        they have no awareness of the outside world. For each hour
        they remain in this trance, the target heals a number of
        health levels equal to the Exalted's Essence score. As with
        Healing Trance Meditation, this Charm can heal aggravated
        damage and replace lost limbs and other, similar
        maimings. The times required to heal these injuries are as
        for Bodily Regeneration Prana, above. Neither of the
        characters involved regains Essence during the healing
        period (assuming that the target has any Essence to regain
        â€” he may, after all, be an unExalted mortal).<br>

        Errata:<br>
        Healing Trance Meditation refers twice to itself as if it were a different Charm. The text is actually
