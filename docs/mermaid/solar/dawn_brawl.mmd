        The character infuses his anima with Essence, making
        his strikes much more damaging. On a successful attack,
        the character may count his extra successes twice for the
        purposes of determining damage. The Essence for this
        Charm may be spent after the character rolls the attack.

        The character suffuses her fists with Essence, hardening
        them into deadly weapons. Until her next action, her
        hand-to-hand strikes do lethal damage, and she can safely parry
        lethal damage blows with her hands. However, she is no
        faster than normal and so, generally, cannot parry incoming
        arrows or magical attacks without a well-described stunt.

        <br>
        The character concentrates her anima around her fist
        and smashes it into her enemy, stunning and disorienting
        him. The character makes a normal attack with her Dexterity
        + Brawl. If successful, the attack does no normal
        damage but, instead, does a base of one point of stunning
        damage for every mote spent on the Charm. This stunning
        damage is soaked as bashing damage, but can only be
        soaked with the target's Stamina. Extra successes on the
        attack add to damage as usual. However, rather than doing
        health levels of damage, each success on the damage roll
        imposes a -1 penalty to the target's dice pools for a number
        of turns equal to (7 - the target's Stamina).<br>
        The Exalted using this Charm cannot spend more
        motes of Essence to power this Charm than twice his
        Strength, and the Storyteller may rule that certain types of
        opponents (mechanical constructs, shambling corpses or
        giant man-eating trees, for example) are too sturdy or
        insensible to be stunned by the character's mighty blows.

        <br>
        The character may wrap his opponents in his mighty
        arms and crush the very life from them. The character makes
        a clinch attack as normal, but the attack does the character's
        Strength + Essence + 2 in lethal damage, while the subject of
        the clinch does only the normal Strength + 2 bashing. If the
        target attempts to escape the clinch, the character performing
        the Dragon Coil Technique may add his Essence in automatic
        successes to the reflexive roll to resist the escape attempt.<br>
        If the target also has Dragon Coil Technique, she may
        choose to activate it as her action on subsequent turns and
        do her Strength + Essence + 2 in lethal damage as well.
        Maintaining this Charm over multiple turns prevents the
        character from using simple and supplemental Charms but
        does not prevent the use of reflexive defensive Charms.
        This Charm is not compatible with Hammer on Iron
        Technique or other Charms of the extra action type and
        cannot be placed in Combos with them.

        automatically wins initiative over a single opponent.<br>
        Characters cannot split their dice pools on the turn they
        use Thunderclap Rush Attack. Two characters using
        Thunderclap Rush Attack in competition roll for initiative normally.

        The character suffuses his body with Essence, turning
        him into a virtual killing machine, with arms like pounding
        triphammers. He gains a number of additional attacks
        equal to his Essence but must make all his attacks against
        the same target. Hammer on Iron Technique cannot be
        Comboed with defensive Charms that allow the character
        to dodge or otherwise avoid attacks, but may be combined
        with those that allow her to soak or ignore damage.

        The character can suffuse his body with Essence,
        concentrating his anima until it is a crackling nimbus
        around him, and become capable of great destruction. This
        Charm must be used to attack inanimate objects and
        doubles the amount of damage the character does after
        extra successes are added but before the object's soak is
        applied. This increase in Strength does not add directly to
        combat damage, though it may assist the character in
        causing indirect damage (for example, by causing a tower
        to collapse on top of his opponent).

        The character tightly focuses his anima, making him
        able to apply his Strength more effectively. In addition to
        doing normal damage, the character also throws his opponent
        on a successful attack. The target is hurled a number
        of yards equal to the character's Strength + his extra
        successes on the attack roll. This attack cannot be blocked,
        only dodged. A target who strikes a solid object takes dice
        of damage equal to the number of yards she would have
        continued flying had the object not been in the way. This
        damage is typically bashing but can be lethal if (for
        example) the object is covered in sharp steel spikes.
        Obviously, the target can also suffer serious injury if she is
        tossed over a cliff or off a ship at sea.

        The character burns with Essence, increasing her
        strength and agility to superhuman levels. She seizes one
        opponent and picks him up bodily, using him to strike
        another foe. The character makes one attack roll against the
        primary target. The attack cannot be blocked, only dodged.
        If successful, this attack does no damage, but the attacker
        may immediately make a reflexive Brawl attack at her full
        dice pool against another target within hand-to-hand range.<br>
        If the second attack is successful, both the targets take
        bashing damage equal to the character's Strength + the
        extra successes on the Exalted's reflexive attack. The second
        target may parry or dodge to reduce damage or avoid the
        attack, but if the attack is parried, the character being used
        as a club takes bashing damage equal to the Strength of the
        Exalted swinging him around + the number of successes the
        parrying character rolled to block the attacks.<br>
        If the Exalted hits with her second attack, both targets are
        left in a heap on the ground and must spend an action to return
        to their feet. If the second attack misses, the character being
        used as a club is hurled a number of yards equal to the Exalted's
        Strength, in a direction of the Exalted's choice, as if he had been
        successfully attacked with the Crashing Wave Throw Charm.

            With greater skill and Essence comes greater power and
            control. This Charm allows the character to precisely gauge the
            amount of damage he is causing. Punches enhanced by this
            Charm cannot accidentally do lethal damage to the target. If the
            player rolls more health levels of damage than the target has
            remaining health levels, all remaining damage is ignored. If the
            damage rolled is insufficient to knock out the target, then the
            attacker can roll additional dice in an attempt to do enough
            damage to knock the target out. The character may buy
            additional damage dice at 2 motes per die. These dice are bought
            and rolled one at a time as a Reflexive Action, and a character
            can continue buying and rolling them for as long as he can pay
            for them. A character cannot buy dice to gain additional damage
            levels beyond those required to knock out the target.<br>
            Characters can easily run out of Essence if they use this
            Charm repeatedly. If a character runs out of Essence while
            using this Charm, count all damage dice that have been paid
            for. This Charm cannot be used if the character is wielding
            Tiger Claws or any other weapon or magical effect that
            causes his punches to do lethal damage.

            The character concentrates vast amounts of Essence
            around her hands, allowing her to inflict terrible wounds. The
            character's blow does lethal damage. In addition, when used

            damage of the attack equal to the attacking character's Permanent
            Essence. However, this Charm is far more effective when
            used against inanimate targets. If the character attacks an
            inanimate object, add a number of damage levels equal to four
            times the attacking character's Permanent Essence. A single
            such punch or kick can knock down a sturdy oak door or break
            a hole in a ship's hull large enough to walk through.
