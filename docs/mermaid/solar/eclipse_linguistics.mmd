        Through the use of this Charm, a character can write
        or copy with superhuman speed. While this does not allow
        the character to write creative works much faster than
        normal (since the physical act of writing rarely slows a
        creator), she can write quickly enough to copy even a large
        book in a single day or make an accurate transcript of a rapid
        conversation containing multiple parties. While the
        character's writing doesn't destroy pens from writing too
        fast, they do wear down at the regular speed, and the
        character's writing consumes the regular amount of ink. The
        product of this Charm is a copy of the work in question, not
        a perfect facsimile. It's written in the character's own hand,
        contains as many errors as if the character had done it at
        normal speed without the use of a Charm and is otherwise
        an imperfect rendering of the original.

        Sometimes a character needs more than a copy of a
        document; sometimes he needs a perfect facsimile. Flawless
        Brush Discipline allows a character to produce just
        that. The character copies at her regular writing speed, but
        the result is not a copy, but a perfect replica of the original
        document, indistinguishable from the original. A character
        without colored inks trying to copy illuminated text
        will produce a carefully shaded monotone replica of the
        original. Flawless Brush Discipline copies only text and
        illustrations — it does not allow the character to forge seals
        or impressions affixed to a document.

        By carefully injecting allusions, subtle stresses and
        loaded word choices, the character can imbed a secret
        message in a document of seemingly innocuous character
        - a shopping list, a bill of lading or even a quickly dashed
        note. The intended recipient (who must be very familiar to
        the Exalted using this Charm) is the only one who will be
        able to comprehend the message, though an Exalted using
        the Sagacious Reading of Intent Charm will be able to
        detect the Letter-Within-a-Letter Technique's use. The
        hidden message can be no longer (in words) than one-half
        the length of the &quot;cover&quot; document.

        The character can make out the minute traces of
        writing that was once readable but has now been damaged
        or erased. Examples are palimpsests, water-soluble inks
        that have been left in the rain and stone inscriptions that
        have been rendered unreadable by purposeful vandalism or
        the action of the elements. Writing of which effectively no
        traces remain - writing on paper that was burnt to ash of
        on stone that has been smashed to gravel — cannot be
        recovered with this Charm.<br>
        Discerning Savant's Eye does not give the character
        the ability to understand a language she cannot normally
        read, though she may use Flawless Brush Discipline to
        make a perfect copy of the material as it originally appeared
        for later translation.

        This Charm allows a character reading a letter, book or
        other form of written text to understand the author's biases,
        opinions and hidden agendas. Characters using this Charm
        when reading a book will immediately discer if and in what
        direction the material is slanted. Note that this works even if the
        author is unaware of her own biases. In addition to the obvious
        uses, this Charm is very useful for detecting literary forgeries.

        Exalted with this Charm can convey ideas and concepts
        through pantomime. The character's gestures carry far
        more meaning than any normal mortal's. While there is
        little room for subtlety or poetry, the character can communicate
        even complex concepts across the language barrier.
        For example, a character could convey, &quot;He offended my
        honor, and I pursue him to seek redress in an honorable duel.
        Surrender him to me or face my wrath.&quot; However, a character
        is unlikely to succeed in acquiring a lover, unless &quot;I am
        attracted to you and desire a sexual encounter&quot; is all the
        wooing the potential partner requires.

        Technique, Sagacious Reading of Intent
        Twisted Words Technique allows one of the Exalted to
        weight certain words or meanings in a speech or written work
        in order to sway the listener or reader to a particular way of
        thinking. Characters with a permanent Willpower lower
        than the character's Essence score who read or listen to the
        Exalted's words will come to agree with the idea she presents.
        Players whose characters possess a Willpower less than twice
        the Exalted's Essence must make a Willpower roll or have
        their characters swayed into a favorable view of the matter.
        Note that the concealed message must be germane to the
        topic at hand, but the character can seem to advocate an idea
        on the surface while the subtext is negative, or vice versa.

        A character using this Charm can speak in such a magnetic
        and engaging fashion that listeners simply cannot do anything
        else but pay attention to what he's saying. When he activates this
        Charm, the Exalted's player makes a Manipulation + Linguistics
        roll. Thereafter, players of characters with an Essence less than
        the Exalted's who hear the Chosen speak must make a reflexive
        Willpower roll with a difficulty equal to the number of successes
        made on the Linguistics roll. Those who fail are entranced by the
        character's voice and are held enraptured until the character
        ceases speaking for more than a few seconds.<br>
        It is not necessary to speak the Exalted's language to
        succumb to this power. Attack or other obvious open hostility
        causes the effect of this Charm to end. However, only direct
        physical danger will disrupt the effect. A brave or suicidal Exalted
        could, for example, use Unbreakable Fascination Method to
        keep a platoon of guards in a burning building with him until it
        was fully aflame, but they would not stand there listening as the
        flaming timbers started crashing down around them.
