        The Exalted uses Essence to enhance his ability to withstand
        attack. The player may roll up to his character's Stamina
        + Resistance in dice, but must spend one mote of Essence per
        die rolled. For every success on this roll, the character adds 1 to
        his bashing soak for the remainder of the scene. This Charm
        may be used again on subsequent rounds, but a character
        cannot gain more dice of bashing soak via Durability of Oak
        Meditation than his Stamina + Resistance.<br>
        <br>
        Rule change:<br>
        The Essence cost of this Charm is reduced to one mote per 2 dice rolled, from 1 mote per die.

        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted hardens
        his skin into impenetrability, sacrificing some of his life
        force to gain the strength of unbreakable diamond. The
        character using this Charm takes no damage whatsoever
        from a single attack. This Charm does not protect the
        character from the secondary effects of the attack - for
        example, a character smashed down through a sheet of ice
        and into a frozen lake by the blow of a giant beastman's
        club would take no damage from the impact or from
        passing through the ice, but she would have to contend
        with the dangers of drowning and hypothermia.<br>
        The Adamant Skin Technique can also be used to
        withstand physical damage not associated with combat. It is as
        effective at withstanding the impact of a fall as the blow of a
        sword. However, Storytellers should keep in mind that the
        defense offered by the Adamant Skin Technique is of a very
        short duration — the character might use it to withstand the
        impact of a falling idol or a plunge from the top of a tower, but
        a character who hurled himself into a blazing firepit would only
        be protected for a second or two. A character must invoke the
        Adamant Skin Technique before his opponent's attack roll.

            Some Exalted, in their years of wandering the wilder-
            ness, develop an immunity to nature's rigors. To simulate
            this, a character can take this Charm to grant permanent
            resistance to one of the following conditions. Each time she
            purchases this Charm, she can choose one of the following:<br>
            • Resistance to Extreme Heat<br>
            • Resistance to Extreme Cold<br>
            • Resistance to Acid<br>
            • Resistance to Windblown Particles<br>
            A character with one of these resistances suffers no
            damage from natural occurrences of the condition and is
            comfortable acting in it wearing normal gear. For instance,
            a Chosen with Resistance to Extreme Heat may walk
            across the most brutal of deserts without penalty, but still
            suffers damage if caught in a forest fire or magical flame.
            This Charm is similar to Ox-Body Technique, in that an
            Exalt can take it repeatedly, until she has purchased all
            four versions. A character cannot purchase this Charm
            more times than she has dots in the Resistance Ability.

            Pain-Reducing Meditation<br>
            <br>
            Cost: 1 mote per -1
            Duration: One scene
            Type: Reflexive
            Minimum Resistance: 3
            Minimum Essence: 2
            Prerequisite Charms: Interrogation-Resisting Attitude, Durability of Oak Meditation
            The cumulative effects of pain can bring down even
            the hardiest of Exalted. This Charm allows a Chosen to
            ignore pain through the application of Essence. To activate
            the Charm, the Exalted chooses to what degree he
            wishes to ignore wound penalties for the remainder of the
            scene. For each -1 wound penalty the character ignores,
            the Charm costs 1 mote to activate. This Charm may be
            used multiple times during a single scene, with cumulative
            effects. A character can also negate more points of
            wound penalties than he is currently suffering, to anesthetize
            himself against later injury.

            Armor of Virtue Technique<br>
            <br>
            Cost: 3 motes<br>
            Duration: One scene<br>
            Type: Simple<br>
            Minimum Resistance: 2<br>

            Through the expenditure of Essence, this Charm
            allows the Exalted to reinforce his ability to withstand
            attack with one of his Virtues. The character must
            choose the Virtue at the beginning of the scene and act
            in accordance with that Virtue for the duration of the
            scene. If at any point he acts contrary to the chosen
            Virtue, the Armor of Virtue fades immediately, Specifically,
            attempting any action that would require failing a
            Virtue check causes the Charm's effects to expire. For
            example, abandoning or attempting to abandon a loved
            one to perish miserably while under the protection of
            Compassion causes the Armor of Virtue to fail.<br>
            When invoked, the Armor of Virtue Technique
            increases the character's bashing soak by the value of the
            character's chosen Virtue for the rest of the scene. This
            Charm may be used again on subsequent turns, but a
            character cannot gain a greater bonus to his bashing soak
            via Armor of Virtue Technique than his Stamina +
            Resistance. The effects of this Charm are compatible
            with the effects of other Resistance Charms that increase
            the character's soak.
            While under the effect of the Armor of Virtue Technique,
            the Exalted's Caste Mark glows brightly, as if the
            character had spent 4 to 7 motes of Peripheral Essence.
            Invoking this Charm automatically adds one point to the
            character's Limit.

            Through the expenditure of Essence, the Fivefold
            Armor of Virtue Technique allows the Exalted to reinforce
            his ability to withstand attack with one of his Virtues.
            The character must choose the Virtue at the beginning of
            the scene and act in accordance with it for the duration of
            the scene. If at any point he acts contrary to the chosen
            virtue, the Fivefold Armor of Virtue fades immediately, as
            per the Armor of Virtue Technique.<br>
            When invoked, the Fivefold Armor of Virtue
            Technique increases the character's lethal soak roll by
            the value of the character's chosen Virtue for the rest
            of the scene. This Charm may be used again on subsequent
            turns, but a character cannot gain a greater
            bonus to his lethal soak via Fivefold Armor of Virtue
            than his Stamina + Resistance.<br>
            While under the effect of the Fivefold Armor of
            Virtue Technique, the Exalted's anima glows brightly
            enough to read by, as if the character had spent 8 to 10
            motes of Peripheral Essence. Characters wearing armor
            cannot use this Charm. Invoking this Charm automatically
            adds one point to the character's Limit.
