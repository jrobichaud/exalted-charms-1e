        This Charm allows a character to command the respect
        of an audience. While they may not be swayed by his
        arguments or impressed by his performance, they will pay him
        heed and refrain from heckling him or leaving the venue in
        significant numbers prior to the end of the performance.

        Violent mobs can endanger even the Exalted. Their numbers
        can drag down even the mightiest of the Chosen, but those who
        compose the mob are probably not normally so violent or dangerous.
        Chances are, the riot has begun over some legitimate grievance
        — laying about with lethal force is likely to cause serious repercussions.
        Through the use of this Charm, a character can deliver astern
        rebuke and shatter the inertia holding an angry mob together.
        Without significant further impetus, the crowd will disperse. This
        Charm does nothing to an organized or disciplined force.

        If an angry mob is a danger to its victims, then a stampeding
        crowd or a routing unit is a danger to everyone in the
        vicinity. The crush of a panicked crowd will clog a door and
        leave no room for escape, where an orderly exit would have
        saved most or even all of the persons involved. A routing unit
        will shatter, leaving its members vulnerable to attacks that
        could never have been pressed home against the formation.<br>
        When using this Charm, the character burns with an
        incandescent blaze of Essence, radiating power and reassurance.
        All those within a radius of (10 x the Exalted's Essence
        rating) yards are immediately steadied. Those who have failed
        Valor checks can roll again, and characters who must make
        new Valor checks are assumed to succeed. Rout-Stemming
        Gesture can even overcome supernatural panic, such as that
        caused by the Terrifying Apparition of Glory Charm or by the
        anima power of a Dawn Caste Solar Exalted.

        The persuasive power of an Exalted channeling Essence
        into Social Charms can raise mobs as well as disperse them.
        With 10 to 20 minutes of haranguing a crowd on nearly any
        subject, an Exalted can whip the listeners into an angry mob.
        A mob raised in this fashion lasts a number of hours equal to
        the character's Essence rating but (like a natural mob) will
        disperse if subjected to organized opposition that cannot be
        immediately overwhelmed or if the mob is left idle without
        things to smash or burn for more than 10 or 20 minutes.

        The Solar Exalted can inspire far more than simple
        mob violence. An Exalted in battle can radiate the
        confidence and the surety of the Unconquered Sun,
        lifting the souls of those around her and inspiring them
        to feats of great heroism. All friendly troops within a
        radius equal to the character's Essence x 100 yards are
        affected. While subject to this Charm, assume that
        individual soldiers all operate with a bonus die to all
        combat-related dice pools from improved morale and do
        not fail Valor rolls. The effect on the overall outcome of
        the battle is up to the Storyteller to decide, but it should
        have considerable influence.

        Actual combat is only the end of a long process that
        begins with the recruitment and training of the soldiers.
        Exalted who know the Tiger- Warrior Training Technique
        Charm can take even the worst gutter-sweepings or bandits
        and train them into a deadly, disciplined fighting
        force. Characters may supervise the training of up to (their
        Essence rating x 100) soldiers in a given week. Soldiers
        trained for one or more months by Exalted using this
        Charm should be treated as elite troops — they are well-disciplined,
        have ratings of at least 3 in the relevant
        combat Abilities, at least one specialty, Valor ratings of at
        least 3 and at least one Physical Attribute at 3. Already-trained
        troops or troops trained for more than one month
        can excel even these ratings.

        The character channels Essence through his voice or
        his instrument, enhancing his delivery and making the
        final result flow far more effectively than it would natu-
        rally. To use this Charm, the player first makes a regular
        Charisma + Performance roll for the character. Then, the
        player may &quot;buy&quot; additional successes, up to (the character's
        permanent Essence rating + the number of successes rolled
        on the Charisma + Performance roll). Each success bought
        in this fashion costs 2 motes of Essence.

        A character who possesses this Charm can give a
        performance so compelling that it plays out in the form
        of phantom images that swirl through the air around
        her. If it is a narrative performance, then the images
        illustrate the narrative, while if it is an abstract performance,
        then the images simply underscore and highlight
        the performance. Typically, this adds a number of dice
        equal to the character's Essence rating to the player's
        next Charisma + Performance roll. Note that the images
        actually appear, fading in and out of existence
        around the character. This Charm is compatible with
        Masterful Performance Exercise.

        The character can channel Essence through her performance
        to evoke a certain emotion in those who witness it.
        The player chooses the emotion to be evoked, which may be
        anger, fear, pride, happiness, jealousy or whatever else the
        player wishes. He then makes a Manipulation + Performance
        roll for the character. Targets with a Willpower
        lower than the number of successes the player achieves on
        this roll are overcome with the emotion in question and act
        accordingly. Those with Willpower below twice the number
        of successes rolled may make a Willpower roll to resist
        the emotion. Those whose Willpower is greater than twice
        the number of successes are unaffected.

        This Charm allows a character to weave a narrative
        so plausible and so compelling that those who hear it
        forget the truth of a matter and come to believe the
        narrative. The player makes a Manipulation + Performance
        roll. The number of successes determines how
        much evidence to the contrary the target must be con-
        fronted with before he is able to shake off the lingering
        effects of the Charm. For each success, the target must be
        presented with one piece of evidence that contradicts the
        narrative. A Solar Exalted in a situation where there is
        very little clear evidence can effectively rewrite history
        with a little careful planning.<br>
        Note that this Charm need not be used as part of a
        performance, per se. Characters who know it can use also
        it during conversation, making them quite dangerous in
        the world of courtly intrigue.
