        With but a glance, the character can evaluate the age,
        health and temperament of a mount or draft animal. The
        Charm will effortlessly penetrate the sorts of ruses used to
        pawn substandard animals off at full price.

        Through the use of this Charm, the character silently
        summons her mount, which will move toward her at the best
        possible speed. This Charm has a range of (10 x the character's
        Essence) miles. The character must have built up a relationship
        with the summoned animal — typically riding and
        caring for it for several days — before it will respond to this
        Charm. While the character's steed will always respond to
        this call and will not become distracted or lost, it's still an
        animal. It can't get through locked doors or penetrate
        complex obstacles any better than it normally could.

        This Charm allows a character to summon up from raw
        Essence a great white steed with a burning golden mane and
        tail. It has the same statistics as a warhorse of excellent
        quality, but it is tireless and fearless and need not eat or sleep.

        Horses' instincts are to run away from what they perceive as
        danger — the smells of fire and blood or the sounds of conflict and
        wounded animals. This often puts them at odds with adventurous
        riders, who are probably trying to reach and linger near the stimuli.
        Through the use of this Charm, a character can render her mount
        immune to terror for the rest of the scene, thus obviating the need
        for rolls to control the animal around frightening sensations.

        While their speed in battle is tremendously greater than
        that of a man on foot, traveling long distances with mounts is
        often slower than walking. Mounts must be rested during the
        march and must be cared for before and after the day's travel.
        Through the use of this Charm, the character can reduce the
        need to care for animals during travel. Mounts under the effect
        of this Charm are very resistant to problems such as thrown
        shoes and injured hooves and legs. They can also keep up a brisk
        walk for an entire day without resting, even when burdened
        with armored riders or cargo panniers. Keep in mind that, unless
        this Charm is used on the characters' remounts or their pack
        animals, the characters' overall marching speed will still be
        limited by the speed of the slowest beast in the group.

        A sick or injured mount is a serious problem for its rider.
        Even outside of a battle, the loss of an animal can be a tremendous
        expense. By the use of this Charm, the character heals a number
        of his mount's health levels equal to his Essence rating. If the
        mount is unwounded, then this Charm cures any diseases or
        parasites the beast possesses. This Charm does not take effect
        instantly - the character must spend a scene tending to the
        mount by dressing its wounds, feeding it, currying or otherwise
        grooming it — for the healing effects to set in.

        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted and her mount
        become as one. The player need never roll for her character to
        accidentally be thrown or fall from her steed. Her mount will never
        panic, and she receives a bonus equal to her Essence score to all Ride
        rolls that cause the horse to jump, rear or otherwise perform tricks.

        By using this Charm, the Exalted can imbue his steed
        with endless energy. While under the effect of this Charm,
        the steed can run at full speed for a full scene (a full march,
        outside of dramatic time) without becoming fatigued. This
        Charm has no long-term ill effects on the mount — the
        Exalted pays the price in Essence and his own health.
