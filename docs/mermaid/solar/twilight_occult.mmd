        While some mortals can manage, by supreme effort, to
        perform magical rituals, magic is simply another, more
        draining way of channeling Essence to the Exalted. Characters
        who have learned the Terrestrial Circle Sorcery Charm
        are able to hone their will into the needle-sharp focus
        needed to perform magic of the so-called First Circle. Note
        that the cost of the Charm is only to enable the character to
        cast a single spell. The actual spell itself has an Essence cost,
        often very high, that the character must pay to actualize the
        spell. This cost is listed in the spell's description. For
        descriptions of spells, see the &quot;Sorcery&quot; section on page 215.

        Similar to, but more powerful than, magic of the
        Terrestrial Circle, Celestial Circle magic is mighty indeed.
        Dragon-Blooded and mortals are unable to practice this
        form of magic, but Celestial Exalted can. It is worth noting
        that there are only a handful of individuals in the world
        who know the secrets of Celestial Circle magic. Characters
        who wish to learn magic of this circle will have to find
        these entities and convince them to share their wisdom.

        The most powerful form of magic available to the
        Exalted. Sorcery of the Solar Circle rivals the anger of the Five
        Elemental Dragons in its power. Only the Solar Exalted can
        practice magic of this magnitude, and most of it was lost after
        the murder of the Solars, many centuries ago. As a result, there
        are practically no spells of the Solar Circle left outside the
        Imperial Library. Characters who wish to reclaim the sorcerous
        power that is their legacy without centuries of magical
        research will have to either search far and wide for magic or
        else bargain with the Yozis and Deathlords for such scraps of
        power as they can be persuaded to part with. Solar Circle
        Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.

        This Charm allows the character to perceive
        unmanifested spirits. Normally, spirits must manifest (appear
        but remain intangible) or materialize (appear in physical
        form) to be perceived. However, characters with this Charm
        can see spirits when they have done neither. Spirits in their
        natural form appear much as they do when manifested or
        materialized, though the character can clearly distinguish
        them from those that are actually visible. Note that this
        Charm does not make the character any more able to strike
        or harm spirits, though it does make it much easier for her to
        direct her attacks. For more information on spirits and their
        powers, see the Antagonists chapter, page 289.

        Prerequisite Charms: Spirit-Detecting Glance<br>
        This Charm allows the character to launch a single
        attack at an unmanifested spirit. For the purposes of the
        individual attack, the character attacks the spirit as if it
        was manifested normally. Characters who do not have
        Spirit-Detecting Glance active (or who are not using some
        other means of perceiving spirits) will be attacking blind
        â€” a +2 difficulty modifier. Spirits killed via Spirit-Cutting
        Attack will eventually regenerate, but this process takes
        some time (potentially decades) and is quite unpleasant
        for the spirit. Spirit-Cutting Attack is explicitly permitted
        to be part of a Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        <br>
        This Charm is similar to Spirit-Cutting Attack, but the
        character's blows are much more dangerous. Name aside, the
        character does not actually place the spirit into her mouth,
        though she does consume its Essence, and its death at her
        hands is permanent. A blow struck using this Charm does
        aggravated damage to unmaterialized spirits and drains away
        motes of the spirit's Essence equal to twice the character's
        permanent Essence, which are added to the character's own
        store of motes. Drained motes that would take the character
        above her normal maximum are still drained but dissipate
        without benefit to the Exalted. Spirits that have materialized
        are no longer vulnerable to the Ghost-Eating Technique.
        This Charm is the weapon by which the Exalted slew the
        enemies of the gods, and spirits hate and fear it. The Ghost-Eating
        Technique is explicitly permitted to be part of a
        Combo with Charms of other Abilities.

        Through the use of this Charm, characters can drive away
        unmaterialized spirits from an area and bar them from entry. The
        character spreads her arms, and a blazing circle of gold-white light
        erupts a number of yards in radius equal to the character's Essence.
        All unmaterialized spirits within the diagram who have a lower
        maximum Essence pool than the character must either flee the
        warded area or materialize. Unmaterialized spirits outside the
        diagram with maximum Essence pools lower than the character's
        may not use their Charms to effect those within the diagram, nor
        may they enter it. Spirits that have materialized are no longer
        subject to the diagram.

        This powerful Charm allows a character to perceive the
        flows of Essence at work in the world around him. Far more
        detailed than Spirit-Detecting Glance or the intuition for
        magic at work that every sorcerer possesses, this Charm allows
        characters to actually see the Essence of the world. Characters
        can not only perceive spirits, they can also see the great gauzy
        rivers of the dragon tracks and the shatteringly brilliant fountains
        and spires of Manses and Demesnes. Exalted using this
        Charm can distinguish the diamond-bright lattices of Charms
        and sorcery at work, allowing them to spot most enchantments
        without the need for any roll. With a successful Intelligence +
        Occult roll, a character can even identify the kind of enchantment
        and (if he is sufficiently familiar with her handiwork) the
        Exalted who caused the magic to come into existence.

            By giving voice to the arcane patterns of this Charm,
            an Exalted can hamper an enemy's ability to use Essence.
            The character must be within a number of yards of the
            target equal to his Essence. The Solar's player and target's
            player must both make Will + Occult rolls: If the Solar's
            player scores more successes, then for the turn when this
            Charm is used and in every subsequent turn in which the
            character spends 5 motes of Essence, the chosen subject of
            the Charm must pay twice as much Essence to use any of
            his Charms or other Essence-fueled abilities. If the target
            scores more successes, then the Charm fails to function.
            While this Charm does not require continuous concentration
            by the Exalt, only the continued expenditure of
            Essence, and counts as the use of a simple Charm every
            turn, it will be nullified if the Solar using it is rendered
            unconscious or killed. This Charm may never be used as
            part of a Combo, nor does it affect beings with an Essence
            equal to or greater than the character.

            With a barehanded blow, the character using this
            Charm makes it impossible for his target to make any
            directed use of Essence for that turn and, potentially, for
            later turns. It must be used with a successful barehanded
            attack (which need do no damage but must penetrate
            the target's block or dodge) and is specifically permitted
            to be used as part of a Combo with Charms of other
            Abilities. The character may maintain the Charm as
            long as she continues to spend 10 motes of Peripheral
            Essence and 1 permanent Willpower for each turn that
            it is in use. This count's as the character's Charm use for
            the turn, as long as se continues to spend 7 motes and 1
            temporary Willpower per turn.<br>
            The target â€” whether he is an Exalt, a spirit, one of
            the Fair Folk or anything else â€” will be unable to use any
            Essence-driven powers and must react on a purely physical
            level. Note that creatures that are magically aflame or that
            have magical venom are not restricted by this Charm, as
            such prodigies are expressions of their fundamental beings,
            and this attack bars only the working of magic. Likewise,
            this Charm cannot stop Lunar shapeshifting or the display
            and use of anima banners. Should the Solar invoking the
            Charm be rendered unconscious or killed, the magic is
            broken. It is whispered that there are more powerful
            versions of this Charm, which can suppress the powers of
            an Exalted for days, years or permanently, but if so, they are
            still not yet rediscovered.

            An Exalted can use this Charm to ward a building or
            room from unwanted entry by spirits. For the Charm to
            function, the area being warded must have a clearly defined
            main entrance and may not be larger than 20 yards
            square. The Exalt invokes the Charm by tracing his Caste
            Mark upon the main door of the area â€” or on the ground,
            if there is no actual door â€” to seal the entrance. Dematerialized
            spirits outside the warded area with permanent
            Essence lower than the character's may not use their
            Charms to affect those within the warded area, nor may
            they enter it unless invited by those within. Should they
            attempt to enter, whether or not they succeed, the mark
            upon the entrance blazes bright gold, visible to anybody
            nearby. This ward is a continuing effect that lasts until the
            room is broken or the ward is deliberately defiled by a being
            that is not a spirit.
