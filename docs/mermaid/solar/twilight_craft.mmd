        Flawless Handiwork Method<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 3 motes per success<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>

        The character channels Essence through his hands and
        tools, enhancing his efforts and making the final produce of his
        work far more impressive than the fruits of any mortal craftsman's
        labor. To use this Charm, the player first makes a regular
        Intelligence or Stamina + Craft roll for the character. Then, the
        player may &quot;buy&quot; additional successes, up to the character's
        Essence rating + the number of successes rolled on the Craft roll.
        Each success bought in this fashion costs 3 motes of Essence.<br>
        Storytellers should consider strongly granting special bonuses
        to objects that are made from good or exceptional
        materials to start and that have astonishing numbers of successes.
        For more details on this, see the &quot;Craft&quot; section of the
        Drama chapter, page 245. Note that Flawless Handiwork
        Method's effects do not occur instantly — the character must
        still take the regular amount of time necessary to construct an
        object of that type, though he need take no longer. An Exalted
        craftsman can knock together in a morning items that would
        take a mortal craftsman months or years to produce.

        This Charm strengthens objects, allowing them to
        endure far more damage than normal. Very fragile objects
        such as those made of paper or glass cannot be damaged
        without the full exertion of a Strength at least equal to the
        Essence rating of the character who used the Object-
        Strengthening Touch Charm on them. Objects that are
        not so fragile take roughly twice as much force as normal
        to harm. For rules on breaking and lifting objects, see the
        &quot;Athletics&quot; section of the Drama chapter, page 251.<br>
        Object-Strengthening Touch does not just protect
        against breakage — strengthened objects are also resistant
        to fire, acid, freezing and other forms of damage. The
        character using Object-Strengthening Touch must touch
        the object in order to cause this Charm to take effect.
        Characters can strengthen any object, not just objects that
        are at the focus of the character's Craft Ability. This
        Charm does not work on animals or sentient beings.

        Objects subjected to this Charm do not have the immense

        Touch, but the enhancement is permanent. While objects
        treated with Durability-Enhancing Technique are not completely
        immune to the ravages of time and nature, they are
        very resistant, enduring at least 10 times as long as untreated
        objects. Objects treated with Durability-Enhancing Technique
        add twice the Exalted's score in the Crafts Ability to the
        Strength + Athletics dice pool required to break them. Items
        such as swords and axes that have been treated with

        Resistance Preparation is not as complete as the Lore Charms that:
        stabilize persons, causing an object protected by this Charm to take

        A character using the Crack-Mending Technique can fix
        any broken object, no matter how severely damaged, so long as
        it was not totally unmade (for example, by powerful sorcery,
        digestion in a Behemoth's gullet or immersion in molten rock).
        The character must spend a number of hours working on the
        object equal to 10 - her Essence, slowly piecing it back together
        and coaxing the fragments to bind to one another.<br>
        This Charm can even remake extremely damaged things
        such as shattered crystal and burnt paper, but it cannot
        remake metaphorical or conceptual things —it cannot mend
        broken hearts, oaths or promises, for example, nor can it
        remake shattered dreams or smashed hopes. Also, it cannot
        remake an object more yards in radius than the character's
        Essence rating. Crack-Mending Technique can restore damaged
        items of First Age manufacture but can do nothing to
        repair those whose magic has fled or been exhausted.

            A Solar who truly masters some form of representational
            art — most obviously painting, but other possibilities
            include tapestry-weaving, carving and metal-casting -
            can fashion miniature worlds within a lifelike representation.
            A being that knows how to expend Essence can step
            into the image and experience it as if it were real. Although
            the examples within the Invisible Fortress are &quot;life sized,&quot;
            a World Within a Picture's physical matrix could be much
            smaller; for instance, a metal brooch chased and enameled
            with an uncannily realistic miniature scene.<br>
            The World Within a Picture can include planes,
            animals or even people, but none of the people are actually
            real. They react only in simple, stereotyped ways, like
            automata. (A Solar can trap real people or spirits within a
            still life to become permanent characters, but this involves
            a spell of Celestial Circle Sorcery.) A World Within a
            Picture's simulated world cannot exceed one acre in area,
            although it may look much larger: A person who tries to
            travel beyond the boundaries of the still life either goes in
            a circle or steps out of the still life.<br>
            Creating a World Within a Picture takes weeks or
            months, depending on the artist's medium and the level of
            detail the artist desires. Once created, a World Within a
            Picture lasts until someone or something destroys it. Other
            Charms and sorceries can piggyback on a World Within a
            Picture if the artist wants to include magical effects within
            the simulated world, such a still life in which people can
            fly, or one that transforms visitors into other forms.<br>
            Entering a World Within a Picture costs 1 mote of
            Essence. Departing is free. Anyone caught within a completely
            destroyed Still Life dies. A Still Life that is merely damaged can
            be repaired, and prisoners retrieved, but only by someone who
            knows the World Within a Picture Style Charm.

            This Charm enables a Solar to spin raw stone into
            flexible thread or yarn. Rock thread is fireproof but no
            stronger than linen and rather scratchy to wear. It is
            entirely adequate for tapestries, tablecloths, rugs and other
            utilitarian purposes, though, and in large quantities, it
            makes excellent insulation. The thread or yarn remains
            the same color as the original rock, making most spun rock
            rather drab — but a Solar with this Charm can spin jade or
            diamond as easily as slate or sandstone. A handkerchief of
            spun jewels would make an understated yet truly royal gift.
            The basic Charm requires no more than a simple
            drop-spindle or spinning wheel and a quantity of rock. The
            listed Essence cost and duration are for spinning a cubic
            foot of rock into a cubic yard of fluffy fiber. The process
            takes a full hour. A more elaborate apparatus (such as the
            broken machine in the Fortress) reduces the Essence cost
            to 1 mote, and the machine runs by itself once set running.
            Indeed, the apparatus reduces rock-spinning to magic that
            even unExalted mortals can perform.

            Conjuring a loaf of bread requires just 1 mote of
            Essence and about five minutes, while sculpting
            an entire feast can cost 10 motes or more and
            take an entire day. This food can be stored.
            However, it will gradually lose its reality and
            after a week, it will fade to wisps of Essence
            when handled.<br>
            While it will fill the belly, conjured food
            offers little in the way of vitamins or minerals.
            For every week that food created in this manner,
            makes up more than 50 percent of a character's
            diet, he will lose one dot in Willpower. Obviously,
            if a character has mastered a sorcery that

            suit of armor — the Solar instills a natural aura of order and
            stability into it, causing it to remain safe from changes for
            a full year. As long as the object endures unchanged
            preserved by the Charm, its wearer will also be protected
            from the Wyld's ravages. Remember that the mote in-
            vested remains committed for the duration of the Charm
            or until the magic is canceled by the Exalt.
