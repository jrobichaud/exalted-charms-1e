        The Exalted fills her weapon with crackling Essence,
        making her swing hard and true. For each mote of Essence
        spent on this Charm, the player may add one die to a single
        attack but can no more than double her character's regular
        Dexterity + Melee dice pool.

        To activate the Hungry Tiger Technique, the Exalted
        charges her body and weapon with Essence, unifying the
        two and making her attack as if the weapon were an
        extension of her being. If the attack is successful, the player
        counts the extra successes twice for the purposes of determining
        damage. The Essence to power this Charm must be
        spent prior to making the attack roll.

        The character focuses her Essence into her weapon and
        swings a terrible blow against her opponent. If the blow is
        successful, the character's attack does an additional die of
        damage against her opponent for every mote of Essence she
        spent activating the Charm. Characters cannot spend more
        Essence activating Fire and Stones Strike than they have
        dots of Strength. Note that the Essence cost of Fire and
        Stones Strike must be spent before the attack roll. If a
        non-orichalcum weapon is used to do more automatic damage
        successes than its damage rating, it will probably break.<br>
        <br>
        Errata:<br>
        This one is entertainingly confusing. Clearly, nazi ninja frogmen secretly altered the manuscript.
        For every mote you spend on Fire and Stones strike, one of your damage dice will not be rolled, it will be
        an automatic success. It does not add to the damage of the attack, it merely takes what would normally be
        dice rolled for damage and converts them to automatic successes. This is a wager – if you do less dice of
        damage than you paid the conversion cost on, you have wasted the Essence. Obviously, if you can hit them
        at all while using this Charm, you will generally do at least one Health Level of damage, since all
        successful attacks do 1 die of damage. If the opponent is protected by Invulnerable Skin of Bronze or
        something else that completely defends against wimpy attacks, and you throw a wimpy attack at them, you
        will not do an automatic health level.

        occur on the character's initiative, but each is rolled
        separately. If the defender attempts to dodge or parry, one
        roll is made and the results are applied to both attacks.

        The Exalted surrounds herself with a nimbus of Essence,
        and her movements become as rapid and smooth as
        ice on hot metal. The character may make multiple attacks,
        either against multiple targets or a single opponent.
        The character may attack as many times as she likes, so
        long as she has sufficient Essence to fuel the Charm. Each
        attack costs motes of Essence equal to the twice the total
        number of attacks the character has made that turn,
        including his normal attack. A character making 5 attacks
        would pay 28 (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) motes of Essence to activate
        the Peony Blossom Attack.<br>
        The player must declare how many attacks the character
        will make this turn before the character takes her first
        action. The character cannot split her Melee dice pool and
        use this Charm in the same turn, so a Combo with some
        sort of defensive Charm is recommended. Defenders must
        dodge or parry each attack separately.

        Essence guides the character's tempo, allowing her
        to strike when her enemy extends for an attack. The
        character may immediately make an attack at her full
        Dexterity + Melee dice pool against anyone executing a
        hand-to-hand attack against her. This attack is made
        after the roll to hit the counterattacking Exalted but
        before damage is determined.<br>
        The Solar Counterattack is not an action and does
        not subtract from the character's dice pools or affect her
        action for the turn. A character can make as many Solar
        Counterattacks in a turn as she can afford to pay for, but a
        character cannot use Solar Counterattack in response to
        Solar Counterattack or any other counterattack Charm.

        The character now rides the impulses of Essence
        with supple perfection. To attack him is to invite a lethal
        counterstroke. Until the character's next action, he may
        respond to all incoming hand-to-hand attacks with an
        immediate counterattack at his full Dexterity + Melee
        dice pool. As with Solar Counterattack, Ready in Eight
        Directions Stance comes after the opponent's attack roll
        but before damage effects are applied. Ready in Eight
        Directions Stance in no way mitigates the attack's effects.
        A character cannot use Ready in Eight Directions
        Stance in response to Solar Counterattack or any other
        counterattack Charm.

            The character increases her mastery of her power and learns
            to charge her weapon with Essence for an entire battle. Filled
            with devastating might, the weapon can deliver punishing blows
            to all opponents. Add the character's permanent Essence to the
            weapon's damage for the rest of the scene. Any weapon save one
            of exceptional quality will fall to pieces after the end of this scene,
            and only weapons made of the Five Magical Materials can stand
            up to repeated uses of this Charm. A character can benefit from
            the effects of only one application of this Charm at a time.

            The character may block, without rolling, a number
            attacks against him that he is aware of equal to his Melee Ability,
            even if the attack is not normally blockable (like a bolt of acid
            or a hurtling boulder). Blocking even a single strong attack by
            a powerful spirit or a Yozi will cause any non-magical weapons
            to perish, but the Charm will blunt the attack at no harm to the
            blocking character. Characters wielding magical weapons can
            parry any number of incredibly powerful attacks without risk.

            The character guides his hands with Essence, allowing
            him to fight with weapons in both hands. This Charm
            reduces multiple action penalties by 2 for an attack or
            parry action performed by a character wielding two weapons
            and completely eliminates the penalty for using a
            weapon in the character's off hand. The character can
            activate this Charm a maximum number of times per turn
            equal to his Melee score.

            Through harmony with the Essence flows, a character
            holding a weapon in each hand can strike once with
            each weapon without penalties for off-hand use or mul-
            tiple actions. In a single turn, the character can make
            two parries, two attacks or one attack and one parry
            without any penalties for multiple actions. However, a
            character cannot split his dice pool when using this
            Charm, and the character's parry is a normal single-attempt
            parry unless the Exalt is also using Two Swords
            Technique. In order to use this Charm, the character
            must have weapons in both hands. This Charm may
            explicitly be placed in a Combo despite its non-Instant
            duration. This Charm may be activated reflexively but
            Combos as if it were of the Extra Actions type.

            The character can now allow Essence to manage his
            hands for him and receives no penalty for fighting with
            two weapons for an entire scene. He may use either
            weapon to perform any combat action without penalty.
            This does not allow him to take extra actions as if he
            were using Charms, but he may split his dice pool
            normally. In addition, this Charm completely eliminates
            the off-hand penalty and also allows the character
            to sacrifice an action for the turn make a &quot;cascading
            parry.&quot; This consumes both his actions for the turn. The
            cascading parry's dice pool starts at the Exalt's Dexterity
            nt Melee + the sum of the two weapons' defensive
            bonuses and drops by 1 for each successive parry at-
            tempt. A character using Two Swords Technique can
            abort to this defense, just as if he were aborting to a full
            dodge or a full parry. In order to use this Charm, the
            character must have weapons in both hands.

                The character enfolds himself in Essence, allowing it
                to guide his actions as he whirls through a breathtakingly
                graceful whirlwind of deadly blows. So long as he has
                weapons in both hands, a character who has activated this
                Charm is an incredibly deadly opponent.<br>
                Whenever the character is attacked, he may make a
                reflexive automatic parry attempt with whichever of his
                weapons he chooses at his Dexterity + Melee + any other
                modifiers. In addition, he may reflexively counterattack
                any hand-to-hand attack with whichever of his weapons
                he chooses. This counterattack is rolled after the auto-
                matic parry, and if the automatic parry is successful, extra
                successes on the parry attempt are added as bonus dice to
                the counterattack roll.<br>
                The parry and the counterattack are &quot;normal&quot; ac-
                tions for the character, and so, the character could
                enhance his counterattacks with Excellent Strike or his
                defense with Golden Essence Block, but the character
                still cannot invoke the effects of more than one different
                Charm per turn without a Combo. In addition, a char-
                acter under the effects of this Charm may not use or
                benefit from extra action Charms, nor may he use or
                benefit from any effect that causes him to make another
                parry or another riposte. The counterattack bonus dice
                added by extra successes on the parry attempt are a
                Charm bonus and count against the character's At-
                tribute + Ability maximum for bonus dice if he uses
                other Charms to enhance the riposte. The counterattack
                effect of Steel Devil Style cannot be used in response
                to other counterattack effects, but the automatic parry is
                still active against these attacks.<br>
                In order to use this Charm, the character must have
                weapons in both hands. If the character is no longer
                using two weapons, he loses access to the Charm's
                effects, though he can use them again the instant he is
                rearmed. A character under this Charm's effects who no
                longer has a weapon in either hand is still unable to
                activate extra action, full parry or riposte Charms while
                disarmed and must terminate the Charm's eftects (this
                can- be done reflexively and does nor require dice or
                count as an action) in order to permit these types of
                effects to work on him.
