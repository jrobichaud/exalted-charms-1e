        Excellent Strike<br>

        The Exalted fills her weapon with crackling Essence,
        making her swing hard and true. For each mote of Essence
        spent on this Charm, the player may add one die to a single
        attack but can no more than double her character's regular
        Dexterity + Melee dice pool.

        <br>
        To activate the Hungry Tiger Technique, the Exalted
        charges her body and weapon with Essence, unifying the
        two and making her attack as if the weapon were an
        extension of her being. If the attack is successful, the player
        counts the extra successes twice for the purposes of determining
        damage. The Essence to power this Charm must be
        spent prior to making the attack roll.

        <br>
        The character focuses her Essence into her weapon and
        swings a terrible blow against her opponent. If the blow is
        successful, the character's attack does an additional die of
        damage against her opponent for every mote of Essence she
        spent activating the Charm. Characters cannot spend more
        Essence activating Fire and Stones Strike than they have
        dots of Strength. Note that the Essence cost of Fire and
        Stones Strike must be spent before the attack roll. If a
        non-orichalcum weapon is used to do more automatic damage
        successes than its damage rating, it will probably break.

        The Exalted charges her weapon arm with Essence,
        and it becomes as fast as a striking snake. The character
        may attack a target twice in one turn. The attacks both
        occur on the character's initiative, but each is rolled
        separately. If the defender attempts to dodge or parry, one
        roll is made and the results are applied to both attacks.

        The Exalted surrounds herself with a nimbus of Essence,
        and her movements become as rapid and smooth as
        ice on hot metal. The character may make multiple attacks,
        either against multiple targets or a single opponent.
        The character may attack as many times as she likes, so
        long as she has sufficient Essence to fuel the Charm. Each
        attack costs motes of Essence equal to the twice the total
        number of attacks the character has made that turn,
        including his normal attack. A character making 5 attacks
        would pay 28 (4 + 6 + 8 + 10) motes of Essence to activate
        the Peony Blossom Attack.<br>
        The player must declare how many attacks the character
        will make this turn before the character takes her first
        action. The character cannot split her Melee dice pool and
        use this Charm in the same turn, so a Combo with some
        sort of defensive Charm is recommended. Defenders must
        dodge or parry each attack separately.

        The Exalted may use the bonds that form between a
        weapon and its wielder to call his chosen implement of battle
        to his hand. This Charm can overcome friction and gravity to
        carry the weapon through the air to the character but cannot
        defeat doors, chains and other such substantial hindrances.
        The character must have his weapon hand empty and must be
        able to see the weapon in order to call it to himself. The
        character must have used the weapon and be familiar with it
        to use this Charm on it â€” it must be his weapon.

        The character may call her weapon back to her hand, even
        if she cannot see it. The weapon does not traverse the space
        between its location and the character's hand, it simply flashes into
        her grasp. The call of this Charm reaches only (10x the character's
        Essence) yards, if the weapon is farther than that, the Charm will
        fail. As with Retrieve the Fallen Weapon, the character cannot use
        this power to steal weapons, only to call her own weapon to her.

        three or four yards across. Each Exalted's blade is different,

        This Charm allows the character to use his weapon to
        attack up to Dexterity x 5 yards away. The weapon whirls
        through the air to its strike its target, like a bloodthirsty, metal
        bird of prey, and then spins obediently back to the wielder's
        hand. The character attacks with his Melee pool, as usual, and
        the damage is determined using his Strength as if it was anormal
        Melee attack. Iron Raptor attacks can be blocked like normal
