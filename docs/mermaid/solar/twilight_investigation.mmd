        The character attunes himself to the world's ambient
        Essence and becomes preternaturally aware of the order of and
        links between objects. For the remainder of the scene, add his
        Essence score in automatic successes to any Investigation rolls.

        By examining the undisturbed physical evidence of
        an event, the character can reconstruct the physical
        process behind that event. For example, finding a body
        with a knife wound, the character can tell what sort of
        knife was used, from what direction the blow was struck
        and so on. This effect need not be limited to bodies and
        the scenes of crimes — characters can likewise recon-
        struct the evidence left behind by liaisons, examine the
        details of a camp site, etc.<br>
        Obviously, the event must have left significant physical
        evidence for a character to analyze. If the evidence is
        disturbed significantly, the Charm doesn't function automatically.
        The player must instead make a Perception
        + Investigation roll with a difficulty determined by the
        amount of disturbance the evidence has been subjected
        to, with success indicating that the character can reconstruct
        the events.

        This Charm allows the character to tell if a specific
        individual is lying to her. This Charm is infallible, within its
        limits. If the target refuses to answer or answers in an unclear
        fashion, the Charm will not indicate him as having lied.
        Likewise, it can only detect lies the target knows to be lies. If the
        target sincerely believes something to be the case, then the
        Charm will not detect him as having lied. This Charm in no
        way compels or reveals the truth — it only detects falsehoods.<br>

        By sorting through possessions, physical evidence and so
        on left by a particular individual, an Exalted using this Charm
        may construct a psychological profile of the character who left
        the evidence. The clarity of this profile is determined by the
        amount of material the Exalted employing this Charm has to
        sort through. The more material, the more likely the character
        is to derive an accurate picture; the use of the Investigation
        Charm Crafty Observation Method is extremely beneficial as
        an aid to the use of this Charm. If there is material mixed in
        that does not actually belong to the target of analysis, then the
        Exalted's picture of the target will be distorted.

        An Exalted using this Charm can make her questions
        impossible to resist. During the extended interrogation of a
        target whose Willpower is equal to or less than her Essence, she
        may wring him utterly dry — he is unable to lie, dissimulate or
        otherwise prevaricate. If the target has Willpower equal to or
        less than twice the Exalted's Essence, the Exalted's player may
        make a Manipulation + Investigation roll. For every success,
        the target must truthfully and to the best of his ability answer
        a single question. The Charm Ten Magistrate Eyes cannot be
        used to gain extra successes on this roll.<br>
        This Charm does not work on targets whose Willpower is
        higher than twice the Exalted's Essence. In any event, this
        Charm loses its effectiveness with repeated use — if used by an
        Exalted on the same target more than once during a period equal
        to the target's Willpower in weeks, the Charm has no effect.<br>
        <br>
        Errata:<br>
        On the sixth line of the first paragraph of the charm’s description, it says that a weak effect occurs if the
        target’s Willpower is less than or equal to &quot;twice the Exalted’s Willpower&quot;. This should read &quot;twice the
        Exalted’s Essence&quot; instead.

        By visiting the scene of an event and attuning himself to
        local Essence flows and residues, the Exalted can psychically
        reenact history, reconstructing the event to the point of
        gaining insight he could not normally receive from evidence
        alone. The character must have time alone to go over the
        scene, touch and examine the largely undisturbed evidence
        and &quot;get into the shoes&quot; of one of the people involved.<br>
        The Exalted experiences flashbacks of the event from the
        perspective of the person he is emulating and gains insight into
        the target's persona, including her Nature and her superficial
        feelings and attitudes over the course of the reenacted event.
        Characters involved in reenacting an event are rarely danger-
        ous, but if disturbed, they may very briefly cling to the adopted
        persona before snapping back to the current moment.

            When a character uses this Charm, he will perceive
            blood dripping from the hands of anyone within 10 yards of
            him who has killed someone within the last five days. The
            vision is momentary, but quite clear. The Charm lasts long
            enough for him to turn around and look all around him,
            though if someone takes pains to hide her hands, he will not
            be able to see any blood that might be there and judge
            whether or not she has killed. A target who has merely killed
            a single person will have simple bloodstains on her hands; an
            Exalted who has massacred a troop of guards will have hands
            dripping with gore. The Charm makes no distinctions on
            the basis of motives for killing or types of killing, but merely
            shows whether or not those close by have killed.

            This Charm allows the Exalted to scan a crowd of
            people or a landscape, as far as the eye can see, searching
            for a particular person or thing, focusing all his attention
            on his prey. If any part of his target is theoretically within
            his view — however great the distance — then he will see
            it as clearly as if he were only 10 yards away, together with
            the immediate surroundings for five yards around the
            target. This applies even if his target is camouflaged or
            partly concealed, in which case the visible part of the
            target will be identified as obviously part of the complete
            target. The only way to avoid this Charm is to be wholly
            concealed by some object between the target and the
            Exalt. However, the Exalted must know what he is looking
            for; attempts merely to look for &quot;something odd&quot; will be
            fruitless. Characters who are invisible cannot be detected
            with this spell, but even the cleverest of magical camouflage
            is penetrated by it.

            With this Charm, an Exalt can hear the private
            whispers of guilt that underlie most speech, betraying the
            dark secrets of an interrogated person. When invoked, it
            will allow the Solar to know the single thing about which
            the target feels guiltiest concerning the subject under
            discussion. The Solar will seem to hear the target's voice
            whispering his guilt and shame about the matter, while the
            target continues to speak of whatever he chooses and is not
            necessarily aware that he is revealing his hidden secrets. If
            the target refuses to say anything, then the Charm fails to
            provide any answers. Also, the Charm operates on the
            target's personal perceptions of guilt: If the target feels no
            guilt or shame about his private actions, then the Charm
            will not reveal them. Thus, a sincere and self-justified
            revolutionary might betray his shame in not speaking up
            publicly for his cause but not his private involvement in a
            recent assassination of a Terrestrial Exalted. Unfortunately,
            the Charm will not function on someone with an
            Essence equal to or greater than that of the user.
