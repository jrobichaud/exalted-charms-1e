            The character charges her form with Essence, moving
            with the speed and agility of a leaping tiger. During the turn
            when this Charm is activated, the character adds her Martial
            Arts score to her Dexterity for purposes of determining how
            fast she can sprint, run or jump in a single turn.

            The character charges her anima with Essence, which in
            turn infuses her hands with the power ofa tiger's deadly claws. Her
            blows do lethal damage even if she is not wearing tiger claws. Ifshe
            is using tiger claws, she may add a number of damage dice equal
            to her Permanent Essence score to her raw damage for the attack.

            The character adopts the attitude and stance of a raging
            tiger â€” crouching, ready to spring on its prey. While using the
            Tiger Form, he adds his Martial Arts score to his damage when
            making Martial Arts attacks and adds his Permanent Essence
            to his bashing and lethal soak totals. The damage bonus applies
            only if the character is attacking barehanded or wearing tiger
            claws. Also, the character's Martial Arts attacks automatically
            do lethal damage even if he is not wearing tiger claws, and the
            character suffers no penalties for fighting while prone. This
            Charm is incompatible with armor. Characters cannot use
            more than one martial arts form-type Charm at a time.

            her opponent, she automatically knocks that opponent
            down. Only Charms like Immaculate Balance or other
            similar magical effects that maintain the target character's
            balance can prevent the victim from falling.

            The character can infuse his hands with Essence, hardening
            them to the degree that they cause massive and deadly
            wounds. The character's hands do base damage of 4L. if he
            attacks unarmed, or add 4 to his base damage if he is attacking
            with tiger claws. For each additional mote of Essence spent
            on this Charm, the character may add one die to a single
            attack, up to a limit of double the character's regular Dexter-
            ity + Melee dice pool. The attacker's hands leave deep
            furrows in the target; they can even claw through wooden or
            iron-bound doors and deeply score stone in a single blow.

            <br>
            Like the tiger, the Exalted can stealthily stalk her prey.
            Whenever she sneaks up on an opponent, the character may
            add one die to all Stealth and Awareness rolls involved in the
            ambush for every two motes of Essence spent activating this
            Charm. The effects persist until the character ambushes her
            target or she is detected. The character cannot spend more
            motes to increase her dice pool than she has points of
            Permanent Essence. This Charm only works when a character
            is actually sneaking up on an opponent; no bonuses are
            gained if the character is attempting to sneak away from
            danger or for any other purpose (for example, stealing
            something or scouting enemy positions).

            The Exalted can spring from cover with the deadly force
            of a tiger leaping onto the back of an unsuspecting gazelle.
            When attacking a target unaware of the Exalted character's
            presence, the target's lethal or bashing soak score is halved
            before the raw damage of the attack is applied. If the target
            knows the attacker's location, or is aware of an impending
            attack, this Charm does not function. A target's successful use
            of the Surprise Anticipation Method (see Exalted, p. 197)
            completely negates the effects of this Charm.

            Cloaking Shadows Attack, Celestial Tiger Hide
            Burning with the passion of an enraged tiger, the character
            can lash out in a rain of deadly blows. A character using this
            Charm may make two attacks every turn, so longas she uses her
            Martial Arts ability. In addition, whenever she is successfully
            attacked, the character may immediately (before damage is
            determined) make a Martial Arts counterattack with a dice
            pool equal to her Martial Arts ability plus the attacker's extra
            successes from his attack. The damage from the opponent's
            attack and his own counterstrike are applied simultaneously.
            This Charm cannot be used to retaliate against any other
            counterattack Charm. Each blow does lethal damage even if
            the attacking character is not wearing tiger claws. If desired, a
            full parry or full dodge can be substituted for one or both of the
            character's two normal actions. However, the character can-
            not split any of these dice pools to obtain further multiple
            actions. This Charm is incompatible with armor. A character
            using Angry Predator Frenzy Style cannot use any other Extra
            Actions-type Charms while this Charm is active.
