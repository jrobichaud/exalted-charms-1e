        The character charges her form with Essence to move
        with the speed and deftness of the snake she seeks to
        emulate. During the turn when this Charm is activated,
        the character adds her Martial Arts score to her initiative
        total. This Charm may be used only once per turn.

        The character's infuses her anima with Essence, and
        it guides her body to flow with serpentine grace. By
        invoking this Charm, she may add a number of dice equal
        to her Martial Arts score to a single dodge attempt.

        The Exalted adopts the attitude and stance of a wary
        snake - head back, ready to strike or retreat. For the rest
        of the scene, he adds his Martial Arts score to his initiative
        totals and his bashing soak. Also, his sinuous, hypnotic
        movements slow and distract enemies. Enemies attacking
        him subtract a number of dice from their pool equal to the
        Exalted's Essence. This latter effect only works if the target
        can see the characters movements â€” a blind opponent
        would be unfazed by this aspect of Snake Form. This
        Charm is incompatible with the use of armor.<br>
        Characters cannot use more than one Martial Arts
        Form-type Charm at a time. Snake Form is the only Form-type
        Charm in the Exalted book, but more Martial Arts
        styles will be introduced in later supplements.

        <br>
        Thought training and the use of Essence, the character
        learns to harden her fingers into talons, like the fangs of a
        striking snake. Likewise, she can toughen her skin until it is
        as strong and supple as snake's skin. For the rest of the scene,
        the character's Martial Arts attacks do lethal damage, and
        she soaks lethal damage with her bashing soak total. This
        Charm is incompatible with the use of armor or weapons.

        The character can harden her fingers to the degree
        that they can punch through nearly anything and cause
        trauma merely by the intensity of their Essence. The
        character's attack ignores the soak of the target's armor
        and can be soaked only by the target's Stamina.

        <br>
        Like the snake, the Exalted defends herself by attacking.
        Whenever she is successfully attacked, the character
        may immediately (before damage is determined) make a
        Martial Arts counterattack with a dice pool equal to her
        Martial Arts Ability plus the attacker's extra successes on
        his attack. The damage from her opponent's attack and her
        own counterstrike is applied simultaneously. Snake Strikes
        the Heel cannot be used to retaliate against Solar Counter-
        attack or any other counterattack Charm.

        <br>
        The character makes a Martial Arts attack as normal,
        including the roll for damage. However, the attack
        does no actual damage. Rather, for every health level
        the character would have inflicted, her target is at a -1
        penalty to all rolls for a number of turns equal to the
        Martial Arts of the Exalted who used the Crippling
        Pressure-Point Strike.

        The character infuses his anima with Essence and
        lashes out, his anima flashing forward like a striking snake.
        The Exalted may invoke this Charm and make a Martial
        Arts attack a number of yards away equal to his Essence.
        The character's anima actually strikes the target, so there
        must be a clear path to the target, and the character must
        be able to perceive the target well enough to attack.

        The character internalizes the reflexes and raw speed
        of a coiled snake. The player rolls the Exalted's Martial
        Arts Ability, and for every success, she may take an extra
        action during the turn. This extra action need not be an
        attack. A character may not split her dice pool during the
        round she uses Striking Serpent Speed.

        The character concentrates her Essence on the tips of
        two fingers, making her attack as quick as lightning and as
        deadly as the strike of a dozen serpents. The character
        invokes the Charm and makes a Martial Arts attack as
        normal, but adds her Essence score to the damage of the
        attack. The attack does aggravated damage.
