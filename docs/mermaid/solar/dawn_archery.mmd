        The character extends her anima into the world around
        her, and joins archer, target and arrow into a single being. Truly,
        the arrow knows the way to the target, for that is its natural
        home. For each mote of Essence the player spends, he may add
        1 die to an Archery attack roll, but the number of bonus dice
        added to any single roll cannot exceed her normal Dexterity +
        Archery dice pool. The player must declare how much Essence
        she is going to use in this Charm prior to making the attack roll."

        The character opens her eyes not to the visual world,
        but to the world of Essence and senses her target in that
        fashion. She may make an Archery attack without penalty
        for visual conditions. Other negative modifiers (high winds,
        range and so forth) still impose their regular penalties.

        The character extends her sense of the local Essence flows
        to greater heights and can now shoot with perfect assurance. The
        character may make an Archery attack out to the maximum
        range of the bow with absolute certainty that the shot will hit.<br>
        The player rolls to attack as normal, but if he rolls insufficient
        successes for his character to hit the target, he still hits it, doing
        the arrow's base damage. This Charm can also be used to hit small
        objects, to cut cords and ropes and for other trick shots. It does not,
        however, allow the archer to negate their target's armor via a
        called shot to the eye, throat or what have you.

        The character's Essence flows into the bow and arrow, and he
        fires with a perfect, supple grace. The character may make a
        Archery attack without any environmental penalties of any sort,
        be they for range, high winds, bad weather, bad ammunition or
        what have you — the Charmed shot is absolutely flawless. Splitting
        a dice pool for multiple actions is not an environmental penalty.

        <br>
        The character flows with soft and unhesitating grace
        through the motions of firing her weapon. Before the
        character takes her first action for the turn, the player must
        declare how many attacks the character will make this
        turn. Each extra attack costs a number of motes of Essence
        equal to twice the total number of attacks the character has
        made so far, including the attack the character is buying.<br>
        For Example: Harmonious Jade is surrounded by Dragon-Blooded
        hunters and needs to act now, regardless of cost. She uses
        the Trance of Unhesitating Speed to make three extra attacks (for
        a total of four attacks that turn). The cost is 18 motes of Essence;
        4 motes for the first extra attack, 6 motes for the second extra attack,
        and 8 motes for the third extra attack. The cost of the Charm must
        be paid before Harmonious Jade makes her first attack.<br>
        The player must decide how many attacks the character
        will make and pay for them all before he makes any
        attack rolls. Obviously, a character cannot attack more
        times than she has ammunition.

        The character's motions become smooth and economical,
        optimized for the release of arrows with a minimal
        expenditure of effort. So long as the character hits (she need
        not do damage) with an attack, she may make another attack
        immediately thereafter. Each attack must be at a different
        target, and the character cannot make more attacks than she
        has ammunition. This Charm ends when the character misses
        or when she has hit every possible target once.

        The character concentrates Essence in an arrow and then
        launches it, causing it to burst into flame in mid-flight. Not only
        will the arrow ignite flammable materials it hits, it also adds dice
        equal to the character's Essence score to the arrow's damage.
        Arrows that have had the Fiery Arrow Attack Charm used on
        them are burnt to cinders and cannot be recovered. Keep in mind
        that indiscriminately firing burning arrows in a forest or grassland
        during the dry season is generally a bad idea.

        The character pours greater amounts of Essence into an
        arrow, and it roars and flashes with Essence as it streaks toward its
        target. The arrow flies faster and straighter than normal, adding
        one die to the character's Archery pool. Also, for every mote of
        Essence the character spends on the Charm, it adds two points
        to the base damage of the arrow. The Exalted cannot spend more
        motes of Essence activating this Charm than her permanent
        Essence rating. Characters using this Charm must spend at least
        one mote to do so — the Charm cannot be activated &quot;for free&quot;
        to gain the bonus die to the character's Archery pool.<br>
        As the Charm's name suggests, if fired on a high arc through
        the air, the arrow forms a beacon that can be seen for miles.
        Arrows that have had the Dazzling Flare Attack Charm used on
        them are burned to fine gray ash and cannot be recovered.

        The bane of the archer is his dependence on ammunition.
        Through the use of this Charm, the Exalted can
        transcend the need for ammunition, at least while he
        possesses the Essence needed to power this Charm. As the
        character draws his bow, he shapes a mote of Essence into
        a glittering arrow. This arrow has normal range and damage,
        but winks out of existence a few seconds after impact.
        The Essence Arrow can be Comboed with Charms such as
        Dazzling Flare Attack or Rain of Feathered Death, allowing
        a character to conjure powerful attacks from thin air.

        The character pulls a blazing bolt of Essence across her
        bow. This is fired as a normal arrow, but does a base damage
        of twice the number of Essence motes that the character
        spent conjuring the Solar Spike. A character cannot spend
        more motes of Essence conjuring a Solar Spike than she
        has dots in the Archery Ability. The Solar Spike moves as
        quickly as a flash of lightning and is not subject to penalties
        for range or wind, though poor visibility can hamper
        shooting. A Solar Spike can be fired out to a distance of
        (the firing character's Essence * 100) yards.<br>
        Regardless of the target's soak, Solar Spikes that
        strike demons, undead and other creatures of the night
        will always roll at least as many dice of damage as the
        firing character's Essence. Solar Spike is not compatible
        with arrow-enhancing Charms such as Fiery Arrow
        Attack and Rain of Feathered Death. The damage of the
        Solar Spike is determined only by the amount of Essence
        the character spends on the bolt and the number
        of extra successes she rolls on her attack — do not add
        the damage of the bow.

        The Exalted can not only substitute his Essence for
        ammunition, but for his weapon as well. Through this
        Charm, the character shapes Essence into a deadly bow. As
        an extension of the character's anima, each bow is unique
        to the Exalted who conjured it. All, however, have the
        same statistics - they do the character's Strength +
        Essence damage and have the range of a compound bow.
        The Immaculate Golden Bow does not come with ammunition,
        so characters without arrows will need to use
        Phantom Arrow Technique.

        The character bundles Essence tightly around the arrow as
        she fires, and as the shaft arcs toward the target, it is multiplied.
        Use one attack roll for all the arrows, but apply the damage from
        each of them separately. The character cannot create more
        duplicate arrows than her Essence score. All the arrows in the
        Rain of Feathered Death must attack the same target.
