            The character can use her Essence to temporarily
            appear to be dead. The instant she performs this Charm,
            she falls to the ground, seemingly deceased. A careful
            examination and a successful Perception + Medicine roll
            of difficulty 3 is necessary to determine that the character
            is actually still alive. While this Charm is in effect, the
            character can hold her breath 10 times as long as normal,
            and she does not need to eat of drink. Although the
            character can use her senses of hearing, touch and smell
            normally, she cannot see or move while this Charm is in
            effect. However, she can act normally the turn after she
            chooses to end this Charm.

            The character using this Charm can climb walls,
            ropes, chains and other vertical surfaces as easily as he can
            walk along a floor. Using Wall Climbing Technique, the
            character can climb up to his normal movement rate per
            turn. In his next turn, the character must either activate
            the Charm again, remain where he is (if such is possible)
            or attempt to leap or climb down normally.

            The character can make a complex sign with her
            fingers and charge it with Essence. This sign distracts and
            slows a single opponent. It takes only an instant to make
            and is performed at the beginning of the turn. The
            character's Martial Arts score is subtracted from a single
            opponent's initiative roll, and the Charm prevents this
            opponent from splitting her dice pool that turn (although
            the opponent may use Combos and reflexive and extra
            action Charms normally and may abort to dodge or parry
            as usual). If, for any reason, the opponent's initiative roll
            is reduced below 1, the opponent may not act that turn.

            The Exalt moves with the speed and ease of a
            flickering shadow While using the Ebon Shadow Form,
            she adds her Martial Arts score to her initiative total. In
            addition, she adds a number of dice equal to her permanent
            Essence to her Stealth score, and the difficulty of
            all attacks against the character is increased by a number
            equal to the character's permanent Essence. The character
            can also decide whether any of her attacks made with
            hands, feet, sai or fighting chains will do bashing or
            lethal damage. This decision must be made before a
            given attack is rolled. This Charm is incompatible with
            armor. Characters cannot use more than one Martial
            Arts Form-type Charm at a time. If a character is killed
            while under the effects of Ebon Shadow Form, her body
            dissipates into acrid black smoke. She leaves no ghost,
            and her physical remains provide no evidence of her
            identity (though her gear may).

            The character uses her Essence to guide her hand,

            target's armor. As a result, a number of points equal to the
            character's Martial Arts score are subtracted from the
            target's lethal or bashing soak before damage from this
            attack is applied.

            A character trained in the Ebon Shadow Style learns
            all of the weak points found in living bodies. With a slight
            touch, the martial artist can immobilize one of her target's
            limbs. The character need merely tap an unsuspecting
            target, a normal unarmed attack at +1 difficulty. The
            attack can be blocked or dodged as normal and does no
            damage. The attacker can choose which limb is paralyzed,
            and the target limb is immobilized for the remainder of
            the scene. Immobilizing a human's leg halves his movement
            speed, and the target's player must make a reflexive
            Dexterity + Athletics roll every time his character is
            struck to keep him from falling. Characters with both legs
            immobilized can only crawl and must generally perform
            stunts to attack, dodge or parry. Immobilizing the leg of a
            horse or other animal with four or more legs merely halves
            the distance it can move every turn. Immobilizing an arm
            keeps the target from using that arm to attack. This attack
            does no actual damage to the target, but it may cause off-
            hand penalties, and paralyzing both the target's arms
            makes it very difficult for him to fight effectively. This
            attack has no effect against the undead, automata and
            other beings that have no vital functions to obstruct.

            This Charm allows the character to stun or incapacitate
            a target with a mere touch to one of the five vital
            centers. To perform this attack, the character must lightly
            tap the target on one of several possible nerve points,
            making a normal unarmed attack. This attack does no
            damage. However, the Exalt's player may roll a number of
            dice equal to her character's Martial Arts + the number of
            extra successes she made on the attack, against a difficulty
            equal to the target's Essence. Each extra success on this
            roll reduces the target's Dexterity.by one dot. If the.
            target's Dexterity is reduced to zero, he is paralyzed. Lost
            Dexterity returns at the end of the scene. The effect is also
            dispersed if the player of a character with Medicine and
            Martial Arts at 3 or higher makes a successful Wits +
            Martial Arts roll at difficulty 3 to remove the paralysis.
            Removing paralysis is a normal dice action, and the target
            may move normally in the next turn. With a successful
            Wits + Stealth roll of difficulty 1, this touch can be made
            to seem like a simple pat on a shoulder or an unintentional
            push. This attack cannot be used against the undead or
            other beings that lack vital centers.

            This Charm allows the character to flatten her body in
            order to pass through narrow spaces as easily as a shadow
            slides under a door. The character can fit her entire body
            through any space wide enough for her to fit her fingers
            through. The character is shadowy and indistinct, composed
            of tangible darkness and not flesh. It is impossible to identify
            the character while this Charm is in effect, though her gear
            may betray her. Even if her anima banner activates, only her
            Caste Mark will shine forth, and her anima banner, while
            bright as usual, will be muted and generic.<br>
            The Exalt cannot wear any armor when using this

            permanent Essence to both her lethal and bashing soaks
            while the Charm is in effect. This Charm is incompatible
            with any other Charms that increase the character's
            natural soak and have durations longer than Instant. A
            character using this Charm sees as easily in total darkness
            as in light, though she must actually use her eyes to see,
            and so, this magic lends no aid if she must fight blind-
            folded or in thick fog.

            In ancient times, Exalted assassins circumvented the
            protections of their enemies by stepping directly through
            them. By using this Charm, the Exalt steps into a shadow
            and steps out of another shadow far away, near his desti-
            nation. The Exalt must have a shadow to step into, and he
            must have seen his destination before, though seeing it
            through a familiar, sorcerous scrying or what have you
            also counts. The Exalt then steps into the shadow as a
            simple action. He reappears at the beginning of next tum
            in the nearest unobserved shadow near his intended
            destination. That destination cannot be more than a
            number of miles away equal to the Exalt's permanent
            Essence, and if there are no unobserved shadows within
            100 yards of that location, the Charm fails (though the
            Essence and Willpower are still spent).<br>
            There are certain sorcerous wards (the same as those
            that will block teleportation, which is what this Charm
            is) that prevent the use of this Charm. Generally, it
            cannot penetrate the Manse of a sorcerer, a god's sanctum
            or any other such forbidden place.
