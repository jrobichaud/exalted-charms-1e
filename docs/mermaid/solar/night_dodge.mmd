        Reed in the Wind<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote per 2 dice
        Duration: Instant
        Type: Reflexive
        Minimum Dodge: 2
        Minimum Essence: 1
        Prerequisite Charms: None
        The Exalted lets Essence flow through her body, making
        her motions as smooth as those of reeds and willows in the
        wind. For each mote spent, add 2 dice to an attempt to dodge
        an attack that the character can anticipate coming. A character
        cannot gain more dice than her regular Dexterity +
        Dodge pool. The player must declare she is using this Charm
        and how much Essence she will spend on it before her
        character's opponent makes his attack roll. If there are an odd
        number of dice in the characters Dexterity + Dodge pool, the
        fractional mote left over after buying the last die is lost.<br>
        <br>
        Errata:<br>
        Each mote spent on Reed in the Wind adds 2 dice to the characterâ€™s Dexterity + Dodge pool, not 1 die as
        the Charm description at one point implies.

        Shadow Over Water<br>

        <br>
        Like shadows over water, the Exalted moves with perfect,
        fluid grace and speed. The character may dodge a single
        attack that he can anticipate with his full Dexterity + Dodge
        pool. Characters must spend the Essence for Shadow Over
        Water before his opponent makes her attack roll.

        Seven Shadow Evasion<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 6 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>
        Minimum Dodge: 5<br>
        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Shadow Over Water<br>
        <br>
        From Shadows Over Water to shadow itself, the
        character is too quick to be hit at all. The character can use
        this Charm to evade, without the need for a roll, any single
        attack that she can anticipate, even one that has an area
        of effect. A character must invoke Seven Shadow Evasion
        before her opponent makes his attack roll.

        Reflex Sidestep Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 2 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>
        Minimum Dodge: 3<br>
        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Reed in the Wind<br>
        <br>
        The character's attunement to the interaction of her
        anima with the ambient Essence of Creation makes her
        preternaturally aware of her surroundings. By using this
        Charm, she may dodge attacks that she is not even aware of.
        If the character is attacked, even by an attack she does not
        anticipate, she may spend 2 motes of Essence to attempt to
        evade the attack. The character's dice pool for dodging such
        attacks is equal to (2 x her permanent Essence score).
        Reflex Sidestep Technique cannot be used as part of
        a Combo with other Dodge Charms. Although the character
        does not perceive the situation until she has already
        dodged, the player may choose whether or not the character
        spends the Essence to dodge the blow. If she chooses to
        dodge, she must spend the Essence to do so before the
        attacker makes his roll.

        The character permeates his being with Essence,
        becoming partly atomized. He moves with an impossible
        fluid grace, and those attacks that he cannot dodge often
        pass harmlessly through his dreamlike body. For the rest of
        the scene, the character may use his full Dexterity + Dodge
        dice pool to dodge all physical attacks, perceived or not.
