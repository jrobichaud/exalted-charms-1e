        The hoofbeats of a steed whose rider employs this
        Charm strike the ground as quickly and lightly as pearls
        falling from a broken necklace. The mount's speed for the
        turn is increased by the rider's Ride Ability in yards.
        Additionally, the rider receives two additional dice for
        Ride checks, as his Essence-enhanced steed handles obstacles
        with ease. These bonus dice do not raise the Ride
        Ability for purposes of attacking while mounted.

        With the aid of this Charm, a rider and steed pair can
        clear prodigious distances with a single jump, safely landing
        leaps that seemed if not impossible, then certainly unwise.
        With room to run, two successes on a Charisma + Ride roll
        will let the mount safely jump one half its movement for the
        turn when jumping for distance. Standing jump, or jumping
        vertically, either up or down, will modify both distance and
        difficulty at the Storyteller's discretion.

        A mount emboldened with this Charm does not
        actually take to the skies, but its feet barely brush the
        ground. So quickly does the beast move that it is capable
        of running over water, deep snow, loose sand or sharp,
        scree-covered slopes without the slightest difficulty. Rapid
        ascent and descent are also made trivially easy and may be
        done at the mount's full speed. A successful Dexterity +
        Ride roll is necessary to invoke the Charm. The mount's
        movement rate for the turn is doubled, and no environmental
        Ride check penalties apply. Both mount and rider
        will still take damage from harmful local environments,
        such as riding over a pool of lava.

        The simple advantages of height and mobility enjoyed
        by a mounted swordsman wreak havoc on the
        battlefield. Exalted cavalry are even more terrifying, translating
        their mounts' great speed and strength into carnage
        in the opposing ranks. With a successful Dexterity + Ride
        roll, the Dragon-Blooded rider can add up to his Ride skill
        in extra damage dice to hand-to-hand attacks. Archery
        and Thrown attacks are not affected by this Charm. This
        Charm can explicitly be included in Combos with Charms
        of other Abilities.

        Charge of One Hundred Generals<br>

        Only the Exalted dare to stand and meet this deadly
        charge with any hope of success. The Dragon-Blooded
        rider gathers cavalry to her side, pays the Essence cost of 1
        mote per ally and mount (including herself and her steed)
        and forges the unit into a thunderous charge that moves
        across the field of battle as one. Where the charge hits
        enemy lines, pikes snap, shields crack and defenders fall
        while the charge rides through unscathed. Every member
        of the charge attacks on the leader's initiative, and the
        charge's attacks are resolved before any delayed attack
        actions on the part of the defenders. Any defender who
        suffers damage but is not knocked unconscious or killed
        must immediately make a Ride or Athletics check to avoid
        being dismounted or knocked down. Defenders who retain
        their lives and their feet may then attack normally. The
        Exalt must ride with the group, which cannot number
        more than 5 x the character's permanent Essence.

        The beasts typically chosen for mounts are (with the
        possible exception of the ass) generally considered to be
        brave, solid creatures. Still, even stout courage may not be
        enough when the mount comes face to face with the dangers
        a Dragon-Blood will invariably encounter fulfilling her duties
        as a Prince of the Earth. Using this Charm, an Exalt rider can
        bolster her mount's natural bravery with her Essence, spiritually
        blurring the line between rider and steed. The Exalt's
        player makes a Charisma + Ride roll; each success guarantees
        a turn during which the mount will not bolt or flee no matter
        the danger unless commanded to do so by her rider. The
        Dragon-Blood also does not need to devote an action to
        controlling the mount. No matter the provocation, the beast
        responds exactly as trained, without hesitation. Finally, during
        the Charm's duration, the rider cannot be removed from
        her steed's back while the Charm lasts by force or by accident.
        A failed or botched Ride check may result in the loss of
        actions, but the Exalt will remain on her mount's back unless
        she chooses to dismount - thereby ending the Charm.

        The great beastmasters of the Dragon-Blooded do not
        restrict themselves to average mounts. Fierce bears, big-toothed
        cats and even river dragons have served as steeds to
        the Elemental Dragon of Wood's children. Such impressive
        creatures are never broken without an epic battle of will,
        magic and stamina, however. Activating this Charm allows
        the Dragon-Blood to distill what would be painstaking days or
        weeks of training into one tumultuous encounter. The Exalt's
        player rolls Charisma + Ride, while the intended mount
        resists with its Stamina + Willpower. The Storyteller sets the
        specifics of the task at his discretion, but expect an extended,
        difficult test and a few bruises or worse along the way.
        Breaking a flying creature such as a hybroc or a notoriously
        vicious one such as a tyrant lizard in this manner carries the
        very real possibility of a messy end. Nevertheless, once the test
        is won, the creature is immediately compliant and trainable
        (by the Dragon-Blood at least). A final note â€” this Charm
        does not protect the rider from a beast who rebels after a period
        of mistreatment. Such fierce-natured beasts may fight to the
        death rather than submit again to a cruel master.
