        The peculiar liquid, dancing moves of the Water
        Dragon fighting style allows those trained in them to flow
        out of the way of opponent's blows like water. For a number
        of turns following invocation equal to her Essence, subtract
        one die from the martial artist's own attack pools.
        Anyone attempting any attack against the Dragon-Blooded
        during that time subtracts three dice from his pool for that
        action. A character can only benefit from the effects of this
        Charm once at any given time.

        Like ripples emanating from a pebble dropped into
        the glassy surface of water, the force of an attack enhanced
        by Rippling Water Strike spreads outward from the point
        of impact to affect those nearby. The target of the attack
        takes normal damage, but everyone but the Immaculate
        within 10 feet of the target takes bashing damage equal to
        the successes rolled on the damage roll - if the target takes
        no health levels of damage, there is no ripple damage. This
        bashing damage can be soaked as normal and cannot be
        converted to lethal.<br>
        The Immaculate cannot be selective about who is
        affected by the Rippling Water Strike. Friends are as
        susceptible as foes.

        The body, as anyone can see, contains a lot of water
        - blood. Dragon-Blooded warriors who learn the hidden
        tides and currents of blood can strike in such a way as to
        cause internal bleeding into an enemy's lungs. The victim
        can literally drown in his own blood.<br>
        To use this Charm, the attacker makes a successful
        Martial Arts attack against his opponent, which does no
        damage. However, if the attack succeeds, the Immaculate's
        player then rolls a reflexive opposed test of the Exalt's
        Strength + Martial Arts against the target's Stamina +
        Resistance. If the Immaculate wins the contest, the target
        loses one point of Stamina for as many turns as the player
        rolled extra successes. Though the Drowning-in-Blood
        Technique itself does not inflict health levels of damage,
        it may look like a series of rapid-fire punches or some other
        attack. Subsequent uses of the Charm are cumulative. A
        character whose Stamina reaches zero from the effects of
        this Charm is dead.

        restraining the movement of the Immaculate is cast aside.
        In the case of artifacts and naturally occurring phenomena,
        their effects are suspended for a number of turns equal
        to the Exalted's Martial Arts score.

        Bodies of water absorb force directed against them,
        dissipating damage. With the execution of a few fluid body
        movements, the Immaculate invoking the Water Dragon
        Form becomes more like the watery element she serves.<br>
        For the remainder of the scene after successful invocation
        of the Water Dragon Form, the martial artist gets a
        bonus to her lethal and bashing soaks equal to her Martial
        Arts Ability and can soak lethal damage with her Stamina
        for the duration of the Charm. In addition, whenever
        successfully attacked, the Exalt may spend additional
        Essence points for extra soak on a 1 mote per 2 points of
        soak basis. The character may declare how much Essence
        she is spending after her normal soak has been applied but
        before the attacker's player rolls damage.<br>
        In addition, the character's fluid form makes her
        blows harder to evade. Mechanically, this Charm increases
        her Martial Arts by an amount equal to her
        permanent Essence for the duration of the Charm. This is
        a Charm enhancement and counts against the maximum
        amount the Dragon-Blood may increase her Martial Arts
        by with Charms.<br>
        Invoking the form also requires a successful Dexterity
        + Martial Arts check, representing the basic execution of
        the move itself. If the roll fails, the Charm does not
        activate, and the motes spent to power it are not expended,
        but the character's action is wasted.<br>
        Only one Form-type Charm can be invoked at any
        one time. Invoking a new Form-type Charm automatically
        ends the effects of any currently active Form-type Charm.

        By executing a few special katas, the Immaculate
        invoking the Ghost-Restraining Whirlpool Stance sets up
        a vortex of water Essence capable of immobilizing even
        very powerful spirits.<br>
        To make an attack to set up a Ghost-Restraining
        Whirlpool, the martial artist spends her turn executing the
        movements necessary to start the Charm. The player
        should roll the Immaculate's Dexterity + Martial Arts.
        The player of any spirit in the area of effect should
        reflexively roll Essence in an opposed contest against the
        Immaculate. If the spirit wins, the whirlpool has no effect.
        For every success the Dynast gets, all spirits in the area of
        effect must add a + 1 difficulty penalty to any actions they
        take, as the roiling whirlpool of Essence draws them in.<br>
        If the difficulty penalty ever exceeds a spirit's permanent
        Essence rating, the spirit is totally immobilized,
        unless its permanent Essence rating is higher than the
        Immaculate's. In that case, it still suffers the difficulty
        penalties but, otherwise, acts as normal. The Ghost-Restraining
        Whirlpool has a radius of (10 x the character's
        Essence) in yards. While sustaining the whirlpool, the
        character must add +2 to the difficulty of any tasks she
        attempts, to reflect the enforced formality of her move-
        ment, and cannot move out of the area of effect without
        dropping the Charm.

        If the Dragon-Blood hits his target, for a fraction of
        a second, every moving fluid in the target's body reverses
        itself. Needless to say, living creatures do not
        react well to this.<br>
        The character makes an unarmed martial arts attack,
        which does normal damage. The target's player should roll
        her character's Stamina + Resistance against the
        Immaculate's original attack roll to hit, unreduced by
        attempts to dodge or parry it.<br>
        If the target does not exceed the Dragon-Blood's
        successes, the effects vary. Normal mortals and animals of
        less than twice the Immaculate's size failing the Resistance
        roll are killed outright. Exalted and other magical
        beings take a single automatic level of unsoakable lethal
        damage. Aquatic or amphibious creatures take two levels
        of damage. Even if a target's player succeeds at the
        Resistance roll, she must subtract two dice from any
        action involving physical activity for the Immaculate's
        Martial Arts in turns.<br>
        This Charm only works against living corporeal beings.
        Spirit, magical constructs and other non-living (or
        unliving) beings are unaffected.

        The ocean pounds the shores with savage fury, and
        Water-aspected Immaculates can channel that fury. Upon
        making a successful martial arts attack, the Dragon-Blood
        may invoke this Charm and immediately make another
        attack, at -1 die to her pool. If that attack is successful, the
        Immaculate may make a further attack, but the penalty to
        her dice pool doubles to -2, on the third to -4, and so on.
        Each additional attack doubles the penalty yet again. If the
        penalties reduce an Immaculate's dice pool to zero, she
        may not make any further attacks. The maximum number
        of attacks a Dragon-Blood may make in this manner is
        equal to her Martial Arts rating.

        The dark, smothering Essence of the Water Dragon
        can be channeled through a Dynast's blows to douse the
        metaphorical fire of an opponent's magic.<br>
        To invoke this Charm, the Exalted makes a normal
        martial arts attack, either armed or unarmed. The attack
        does normal damage, and if the target is actually
        hurt by the attack (that is, loses health levels), the
        martial artist's player should make an immediate reflexive
        Martial Arts + Essence roll with a difficulty equal to
        the target's Essence. For a number of turns equal to the
        successes that the Immaculate gets, all Charms and
        sorcery affecting the target are suppressed. If the num-
        ber of successes exceeds the Essence of the character
        who invoked an affected Charm or cast an affected
        spell, the magic is actually dispelled.<br>
        Characters affected can renew Charms on themselves
        during the duration of the suppression. Unless the Charms
        are specifically noted as having cumulative benefits, characters
        who suddenly have the same Charm active on them
        twice when the suppression ends gain no special benefits,
        and even cumulative Charms cannot exceed their normal
        maximum effectiveness.<br>
        This Charm can be used on friendly targets, but the
        martial artist must do at least one health level of bashing
        damage to trigger the effect.

        fails, the damage is aggravated but rolled normally. If the
        roll succeeds, the damage is lethal and rolled normally.
        With at least three successes on the Essence roll, the
        damage is bashing.
