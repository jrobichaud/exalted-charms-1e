        Invoking this Charm allows a Dragon-Blooded to
        sense her surroundings through minute eddies and currents
        in the air. The character may move and act in total
        darkness or with her vision fully impaired with no penalties,
        but obviously, she cannot read, tell colors or otherwise
        discern information that requires vision rather than perfect
        spatial awareness. While this sense is not precise
        enough to be completely effective in combat, but it does
        reduce the penalties for fighting blind by half.

        This Charm eliminates the noise of any action taken
        directly by a character under its influence. Gravel crunches
        silently underfoot. A sword swung by the character would
        glance off an opponent's shield with no sound. This effect
        lasts for one minute per mote of Essence invested. This
        Charm provides no direct benefit to Stealth rolls, but many
        actions will no longer have any chance of attracting attention,
        and there should be no difficulty penalties for moving
        through areas full of potential sources of accidental noise.<br>
        Keep in mind that the noise suppression only applies
        to those actions directly taken by a Dynast. She could put
        her fist through a window with no noise being created by
        the breaking glass, but the glass would tinkle as it fell to the
        floor, and if she instead threw a rock at it, the crash would
        be clearly audible.<br>
        The individual under the influence of this Charm is
        unable to speak while Soundless Action Prana is in
        effect. She may communicate through any other method,
        however.

        Zone of Silence Stance<br>

        By stilling the air to the point where it ceases to
        transmit sound at all, an Air-aspected Exalt may ensure
        that whatever mayhem ensues, the sounds of it will not
        reach the ears of others. A Zone of Silence suppresses all
        sound at all within its reach, be it the ringing of blades or
        the desperate cries of wounded enemies. One could vivisect
        a yeddim with a dull hatchet and someone standing a
        few feet away would be none the wiser — or at least their
        ears would not inform them of the deed. The character
        invoking the Charm is advised to say anything she feels
        necessary before the Charm is invoked, since no normal
        sound communication can take place within a Zone of
        Silence. Dynasts favoring this Charm are advised to learn
        sign language or a Charm such as With One Mind instead.<br>
        The Zone of Silence extends a number of yards equal
        twice the Exalted's permanent Essence. Each extra mote of
        Essence invested into the Charm increases the radius of
        effect by a single yard, but a character cannot spend more
        motes of Essence to increase the area of effect than her
        permanent Essence. Burglars and assassins often invoke
        this Charm to suppress sound in an entire dwelling, so they
        may work without worry of an alarm being raised. The
        Zone of Silence moves with the character.

        Distracting Breeze Meditation<br>

        With this Charm, the character uses the wind to cause
        minor disturbances and distractions to those who might
        observer her passage. Whether it be a tickling wind in the
        ear, a suddenly guttering torch or a knocked over spear,
        this minor enchantment can ensure a Dynast slips by even
        the most observant eyes without being spotted.<br>
        Every mote of Essence invested in this Charm acts as
        2 automatic successes against a single target that might
        detect the Exalt's presence. The Charm can be directed at
        more than one target at once, so long as the proper amount
        of Essence has been paid.<br>
        For Example: Cynestia, an Air-aspected Dynast,
        wishes to sneak past a cave entrance occupied by three
        Wyld barbarians. Her player spends 3 motes of Essence to
        give her two automatic successes in her Dexterity +
        Stealth rolls for Cynestia to avoid notice by all three
        barbarians. If Cynestia encounters other characters during
        the scene, her player can give the character two
        additional dice to evade their notice as well, but cannot
        distract more than three characters at a time. If the player
        had spent 4 motes, Cynestia could distract an additional
        barbarian, but could not give herself four automatic
        successes to avoid notice by one of them.<br>
        The character must not be visible or otherwise easily
        detectable when this Charm is activated. However, even
        a moment out of sight is long enough to invoke it and gain
        the benefits. This Charm does nothing to conceal a Dynast's
        passage, and she maybe tracked as normal. A character
        cannot spent more motes on the use of this Charm than
        her permanent Essence.

        Simply avoiding guards is often not enough to remain
        truly undetected. This Charm summons up subtle but
        useful air currents that conceal the traces of the passage of
        the character and his associates, obscuring: footprints,
        obliterating scents and weeping away telltale broken
        branches and twigs.<br>
        Every to motes invested in this Charm completely
        obliterate all traces of one being's passage for a distance
        of one mile, including scent Non supernatural attempts
        to track the character tails automatically, and supernatural
        tracking attempts are subject to a standard tracking
        contest. The Dragon-Blooded invoking the Charm may
        extend it to protect as many beings as he has points of
        permanent Essence.

        By invoking this Charm, the character gains the
        ability to move normally along any roughly horizontal
        surface - even those normally impossible to cross. Walk-
        ing across mud, quicksand, even water is easy with this
        Charm in place. The Charm also instills perfect balance
        and excellent timing, giving the character the facility to
        easily scamper across ropes, poles, beams, scaffolding and
        the like with no movement penalties.<br>
        The wind walker may move normally in all respects
        across such surfaces, including jumping, rolling, crawling
        — however he wishes to move. However, the character
        must keep moving. If even a single turn is spent standing
        still for whatever reason, the Charm's magic is broken. The
        hero can carry all of his normal gear and up to his own
        weight in additional burdens. Any greater weight also
        immediately breaks the Charm.

        With true mastery of the art of stealth comes the
        power to almost completely shroud oneself from the eyes
        of others. Invoking the Dragon Shroud wraps the air itself
        around a character, concealing her even in broad daylight.
        While Dragon Shroud does not render a character truly
        invisible, her form is blurred and indistinct. Light seems to
        bend around her, making her much more difficult to see
        even if the observer knows she is there — and nearly
        impossible if he does not. The Dragon Shroud also muffles
        sound, masks scent, suppresses body heat and generally
        does its best to foil any attempt to clearly view the Dynast
        This is not true invisibility, however. A careful (or lucky)
        observer can still spot a blurry disturbance in the air where
        the Dragon-Blood stands.<br>
        Every 3 motes invested in this Charm act as one
        automatic opposing success to any action taken against
        character that requires that she be seen, heard or perceived
        with any of the five senses, including attempts to attack
        the character or to spot her when she is sneaking. It also
        quite effectively masks a Dragon-Blooded's identity. The
        Charm has no lingering effects, however, and the character
        can be tracked as normal.

            There are situations and environments where
            moving unnoticed is preferable to moving unseen,
            and in many of those cases, failing to look inconspicuous
            can be far less damning than failing to hide. There
            are also simply scenarios where the best option for
            stealth is to look like you belong there, like part of the
            scenery. A Dragon-Blood who uses this Charm can,
            using Essence to make his body language resonate
            with his surroundings, walk down any street or hall,
            and anyone watching will simply fail to find anything
            noteworthy or out of place about him. Watchers in a
            court might assume the character is a page, think him
            a functionary while in an office or believe he's a
            soldier in a military camp.<br>
            Any rolls to take note of the character are at a
            difficulty equal to his Stealth Ability, though this
            difficulty may be lowered if the character engages in
            very outlandish or attention-grabbing behavior. A
            character using this Charm can, for 1 additional mote
            per ally, include others in the effect, up to a maximum
            number of people equal to his Essence.

            Stealth is more than a subtle gait and the ability
            to remain still. There are a great number of mind
            games involved in going unnoticed: speed of movement,
            gait, body language, clothing choices,
            misdirection, capitalizing on distractions and more.
            These techniques and considerations, when mastered
            can be applied to more specific and specialized types of
            subterfuge. This Charm is such a specialized application:
            The aim of the Dragon-Blood is not to conceal
            herself, but to conceal what she is carrying or manipulating
            with her hands.<br>
            A character using this Charm can conceal an
            object that is no larger than half her size and not
            heavier than can be easily carried in two hands.<br>
            Alternately, she can completely conceal what she is
            doing with her hands by allowing her Essence to
            guide her actions to make sure that observers have no
            line of sight to the object or activity concealed. The
            Essence cost for this Charm is 1 mote per minute per
            subject from whom the object or activity is concealed
            from sight, up to a maximum of the character's
            Essence + Manipulation.<br>
            When concealing an object, the character can
            take any action she wishes without ending the Charm,
            including talking with or even embracing one of the
            targets, so long as she takes no action using the
            concealed object. Taking any action using the concealed
            object ends the Charm. Attacking with a
            weapon that has been concealed through the use of
            this Charm will, in most cases, surprise the target.

            movements what would normally be a deliberate and
            careful attempt at stealth. Masters of this Charm can
            accomplish such feats as hiding in an opponent's
            shadow during combat, vanishing quietly to cover
            when an attacker blinks or assaulting someone on a
            busy street and easily making a stealthy escape. This
