        Cost: 1 mote per two dice<br>

        The magistrate or investigator with this Charm learns
        the myriad ways of the criminal; his eye is better able to
        connect seemingly disparate clues, and his intuition greatly
        improves. The character can improve his Investigation
        dice pool by two dice for every mote of Essence spent. The
        character cannot do more than double his Investigation
        Trait with this Charm, and he must pay the full motes of
        Essence even if he needs to raise a Trait by only one die.

        A good investigator quickly learns to discern the nervous
        habits, tics and mannerisms of people suffering under
        a load of guilt. Since most guilt is associated with a crime, the
        character becomes better able to discover a criminal among
        a group of people. After spending Essence, the character's
        player should make a Manipulation + Investigation roll. A
        success here will point the investigator to the character
        within eyesight currently suffering from the greatest load of
        guilt. This is purely subjective, of course, and mostly left in
        the hands of the Storyteller. Additionally, characters who
        commit heinous crimes without a shred of conscience might
        feel no guilt whatsoever from the acts they perform, making
        this Charm useless in finding them.

        The Exalted's ability to sense dishonesty finally reaches
        supernatural levels when he learns this Charm. With it, he
        can ferret out false statements in conversation, helping
        him find the truth of a situation. This Charm does not
        detect evasions or half-truths; it only points out statements
        that the speaker knows to be false. The Exalted must pick
        a target and spend the Essence and Willpower necessary to
        activate this Charm; for the rest of the scene, falsehoods
        spoken by that target will trigger a tingling sensation on
        the back of the character's neck. If the target is aware of the
        scrutiny he is under, he may conceal lies by spending 1
        point of Willpower per statement. This Charm has no
        effect if the target's permanent Essence is equal to or higher
        than the Essence of the Exalt using this Charm.

        The Exalted spends around 10 minutes walking around
        the scene of a crime (or any event he wishes to investigate);
        his player must then make an ordinary Investigation roll for
        the Dynast to find ordinary pieces of evidence (footprints,
        stray hairs, blood, etc.). This Charm uses a touch of sympathetic
        magic to trace that evidence back to its creator. Roll
        Intelligence + Investigation after spending the necessary
        Essence to activate the Charm. With one success, the character
        receives an impulse — a mild tugging — that pulls him
        in the direction of the culprit. With three or more successes,
        the character receives that impulse along with a fleeting
        glimpse of the culprit as he appeared at the time of the crime.

        By simply meeting a person and coming within a few
        yards of him, the Exalted can sense the identities of his
        closest associates. Typically, these will be the character's
        family members, business associates and members of any
        sworn brotherhoods the Exalt belongs to, but they can also
        be characters delineated by certain Backgrounds. Roll
        Perception + Investigation; every success gives the name
        and one-sentence description of two of the target's compatriots
        or servants. Even if the roll fails, the Dragon-Blood
        will still learn information about one of the target's associates.
        Associates are revealed in roughly the following
        order: family members, members of sworn brotherhoods,
        allies, mentors, connections, henchmen; the Storyteller
        can change that order as he sees fit.

        By simply meeting a person and coming within a few
        yards of him, the Exalted can determine the place that the
        person calls home. Usually, this is the character's primary
        residence, but in the case of the Dragon-Blooded, who
        might have several residences, it is the place that the
        subject truly considers to be his home. If the subject has
        any dots in the Manse Background, the Charm is almost
        certain to point directly at his Manse of primary residence.
        If the subject or one of his allies is a sorcerer, his home may
        be warded against such divinations. In that case, this
        Charm will point to another of the character's residences.
        The Charm will only identify a building, not a particular
        apartment or room within that building — and in the case
        of longtime travelers or the impoverished, the Charm will
        simply indicate that the subject has no true home.

            Those who live in Atsiluth Eternal dwell in luxury such
            as even the Forest Witches cannot imagine. With a moment's
            study of the Essence flows around her, a character can bring
            forth unbounded wealth. Invoking this Charm within Atsiluth
            Eternal, a character can conjure any mundane object or
            structure, as well as any artifact or Manse up to level 5.
            However, the artifacts and Hearthstones this Charm creates
            only affect the &quot;material&quot; reality of Atsiluth Eternal. They can
            improve the user's perceptions but cannot otherwise divine
            information or directly affect the minds of others. They
            cannot act at range without some physical effect that conveys
            their power to the target. Outside of Atsiluth Eternal, they do
            not function at all. The Sea of Mind chooses where the
            summoned thing appears — the character cannot summon a
            Manse into the air above an enemy, although she can expect
            a summoned weapon to appear in her hand.

            The Exalt sprinkles a few drops of blood upon the dust of
            Atsiluth Eternal and calls forth her vision soul: an image of
            herself drawn from a dream of future days. Such images are
            vicious, twisted and perverted liars, desiring primarily to
            torment those who call them forth with false hopes and false
            despairs. A wise Witch can, nevertheless, finagle hints from
            them about the future, the present and the past. The player
            makes a Manipulation + Investigation roll. If the Storyteller
            wishes to play out the conversation, then each success represents
            an opportunity to force out such a truth. The Exalt can
            spend one of these successes at any time to determine the
            vision soul's motivation behind a given statement — for
            example, to tease the Exalt with obfuscation, to encourage
            unwarranted despair or to save face after being tricked into
            making some admission. Otherwise, the difficulty of the roll
            is 3, and success tells the character one thing she should watch
            for, one thing she should fear and one thing she should desire.
