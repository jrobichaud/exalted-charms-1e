        Five-Dragon Fortitude<br>

        The armored scales of the Elemental Dragons can
        afford great protection to their disciples. The Dragon-
        Blooded using this Charm may invoke the colossal stamina
        of the Dragons and soak the damage from one particular
        attack by paying Essence. Soaking bashing damage costs 1
        mote per two health levels of raw damage reduced. Lethal
        damage costs 1 mote per health level of raw damage. This
        soak is applied before damage is rolled and is compatible
        with the use of armor.

        The powerful claws of the Elemental Dragons easily
        bat away attacks upon them. This Charm lets a Dragon-Blood
        emulate this ability, boosting parry prowess with a
        weapon or allowing the Exalt to turn attacks aside with his
        bare hands. For the remainder of the scene, the Dragon-Blood
        may add his permanent Essence to all parry rolls,
        even those made with Abilities other than Martial Arts.
        This bonus is applied to parries made with split dice pools
        after the multiple action penalty is applied, and the Charm
        also allows the character to make reflexive parries at his
        permanent Essence if he has no other way to parry an
        attack. If he is unarmed, the character may parry lethal
        damage without a stunt.

        The power of the Five Elemental Dragons can empower
        a Dragon-Blooded's blows with deadly force. The
        character does lethal rather than bashing damage on an
        unarmed attack.

        The character makes a normal martial arts attack, but
        he does double the normal base damage (extra successes do
        not double). In addition to the normal damage of the
        attack, roll the character's Strengths + Martial Arts in a
        reflexive opposed roll against the targets Strength +
        Resistance. If the character wins, the target is knocked
        down and must spend an action clearing her head and
        getting back to her feet See the knockback and knockdown
        rules on pages 234-235 of the Exalted main rulebook.

        Once a Dragon-Blooded has mastered the basic of the
        Five-Dragon Path, she may master the physical emulation
        of the Five Dragons. The Dynast tries to take on the aspect
        and attitude of the Elemental Dragons. Her demeanor
        becomes haughty and arrogant, her movements swift,
        graceful and lethal.<br>
        This lethality is exhibited in her combat prowess. For
        the remainder of the scene, the character may do lethal
        damage with her martial arts attacks instead of the normal
        bashing damage, and she may also soak lethal damage with
        her bashing soak. She also adds her permanent Essence to
        her Dexterity or Strength when determining her running
        speed, jumping distance or the amount she can lift or carry.<br>
        Characters cannot use more than one martial arts
        form-type Charm at a time. Using a form-type Charm ends
        the effects of any other form-type Charm the character was
        previously utilizing

        With a mighty effort, the martial artist channels some
        of the raw fury of the Five Elemental Dragons. The Dynast
        makes a punch or kick attacking using his Dexterity +
        Martial Arts, as usual. This attack does aggravated dam-
        age. The Five-Dragon Fist cannot be placed in a Combo or
        used by a character wielding a weapon â€” the energy of the
        Five Elemental Dragons must be channeled purely.

        Invoking this Charm allows the Exalt to completely
        ignore damage from any single non-magical atrack. If the
        attack is made with a weapon of the Five Magical Materials,
        caused by sorcery or boosted with Charms, then the
        character only receives a soak bonus to his lethal and
        bashing soak equal to his permanent Essence.

        Suffused with the energy of the Five Elemental Dragons,
        the Exalted explodes into a flurry of action. His hands
        and legs become a blur of motion, and he unleashes an
        unbelievable amount of devastation in the blink of an eye.<br>
        After invoking this Charm, the Dragon Blooded may
        make an extra attack per mote spent, all against a single
        target. All of these attacks are rolled as normal. If the target
        dodges or parries, she makes one roll that is compared to all
        the attacks. The maximum number of extra attacks a
        Dynast can make is equal to his Essence.
