        The power of the earth is massive indeed, bearing as
        it does the entire weight of Creation. Martial artists of the
        Path of Earth can channel some of that power through
        their bodies and into their opponents. The Exalted takes
        a moment to center himself, then unleashes a powerful
        blow. The Immaculate may add his Essence to the damage
        of the next Melee, Brawl or Martial Arts attack he lands.
        If the blow is with a weapon, the character must pay an
        additional point of Essence to channel the power of the
        earth through itâ€” unless the weapon in question is the
        Earth Dragon's signature weapon, the seven section staff.<br>
        This attack can also affect dematerialized spirits as if
        they were material. Obviously, the character must be using
        Spirit Sight to see the spirit and thus attack it.

        This Charm is a combination of martial arts move and
        meditative technique. The disciples of the Earth Dragon
        can often be seen standing as still as statues in the gardens
        of the Cloister of Wisdom, for while invoking this Charm,
        a martial artist's body takes on the very stillness and
        semblance of stone.<br>
        But aside from its meditative function, the Unmoving
        Mountain Stance has applications in combat. Displacing
        a monk invoking the stance is no easy task. For the
        purposes of the Immaculate holding his ground or keeping
        from being knocked down, treat her permanent Essence as
        automatic successes in any contested roll to displace her.
        Fighting opponents using this Charm can be a disconcerting
        experience, as they simply refuse to be knocked off
        their feet no matter what sort of mayhem is applied to
        them. They are immune to all knockback or knockdown
        effects as well.<br>
        The Charm also has some non-combat advantages. If
        an Earth Immaculate is attempting to hide, the ability to
        remain absolutely still and silent can be a great boon.
        Assuming the Immaculate has found an appropriate hiding
        place and is totally still, any attempt to locate her by
        hearing, sound, body heat, etc. must overcome the
        character's Essence in automatic opposing successes.

        With the invocation of this Charm, the Exalt's skin
        briefly becomes as hard as the stony hide of the Earth
        Dragon. The Immaculate's Martial Arts Ability acts as
        armor against both lethal and bashing damage for the rest
        of the turn. The martial artist may also parry weapons with
        his bare hands without the use of a stunt. This Charm may
        only be used once per turn.

        By executing a series of katas, the Earth Immaculate
        comes into true contact with the Earth Dragon and can
        directly channel some of its power. For the remainder of
        the scene after successful invocation of the Earth Dragon
        Form, the Exalt adds his Martial Arts to his bashing and
        lethal soaks against any attack. This armor even applies
        to aggravated damage, which cannot normally be soaked.<br>
        Invoking the form also requires a successful Dexterity
        + Martial Arts roll. If the roll fails, the motes for this
        Charm are not spent, but the action is wasted. The
        above benefits are cumulative with any other Charms or
        anima powers invoked by the Immaculate. Only one
        Form-type Charm can be used at any one time. Invoking
        a Form-type Charm immediately terminates the benefits
        of any other Form-type Charm the character may
        have active.

        The raw power of the elemental Earth is fearsome to
        behold. By channeling this power into his body, an Im-
        maculate can create a great deal of destruction. This
        Charm doubles the Exalt's raw damage for the purposes of
        destroying objects. This boost lasts for the character's
        Martial Arts in turns. The Charm has absolutely no effect
        on the amount of damage that a character does to living
        things. The effect of Shattering Fist Strike stacks with
        other effects, such as a Slayer Khatar's, that increase a
        character's damage against objects.<br>
        Great care is taken in training disciples in how to use
        this Charm properly, as careless use can be dangerous.
        Even though the Charm does not affect living beings,
        improper application can cause damage to the character
        indirectly. For example, if an Exalt were to use Shattering
        Fist Strike on a pillar supporting the roof, he would
        probably be crushed. The Storyteller should apply appropriate
        damage in these situations.

        This maneuver can be attempted either bare handed
        or with martial arts weapons. Roll normally to parry an
        attack. If the roll succeeds, the character has successfully
        captured the weapon between her hands or with her
        weapon. Her player immediately makes a reflexive Strength
        + Martial Arts roll. This roll is difficulty 1 for normal
        weapons but difficulty 3 for exceptional weapons and 5 for
        weapons forged from the Five Magical Materials. If the roll
        succeeds, the weapon the character was attacked with is
        broken, shattered or otherwise rendered useless. Even if
        the Immaculate fails to break the weapon, the weapon's
        owner's player must succeed in a reflexive opposed Strength
        + Athletics test with the Immaculate player's or be immediately
        disarmed. The cost of this Charm is a number of
        motes of Essence equal to the difficulty of the roll to break
        the weapon, and is paid before the parry attempt is made.<br>
        Weapons affected by this Charm are not totally destroyed,
        just rendered immediately useless. They can
        typically be repaired or reforged given time and skill.

        With a precision martial arts attack, the Immaculate not

        small amount of Earth Essence into the target. The target is
        paralyzed and completely unable to act for one turn per health
        level of damage suffered in the character's attack. If an
        opponent is reduced below Incapacitated by such an attack,
        he is not only killed, but turned to stone. The character's body
        calcifies into rock, and he remains in that state forever, a
        ghastly trophy to the Immaculate's martial skill.
        This attack cannot be channeled through a
        weapon. The character must actually hit the target
        with her bare hands.

        The Exalted invokes this Charm as he makes a normal
        attack, raining a flurry of blows down upon his opponent,
        driving her to the ground â€” or at least into some inferior
        defensive posture.<br>
        If the character successfully strikes his opponent,
        make a reflexive opposed roll pitting the Immaculate's
        Strength + Martial Arts against the target's Stamina +
        Athletics. If the target exceeds the character's number of
        successes, she suffers normal damage but no additional
        effect. If the character ties or exceeds the target's successes,
        Earth Essence courses from him into his target's body,
        weighing her down as if beneath the crushing weight of an
        avalanche. For every success he gets, the target suffers a
        one die penalty to all physical tasks so long as the Exalt can
        maintain line of sight to the target. These successes are not
        cumulative if the target is subjected to the Avalanche
        Method on a subsequent turn â€” only the highest number
        of successes rolled applies.
        If the Exalt accrues more points of impairment than
        the target has points of Stamina, the target is &quot;buried,&quot;
        completely immobilized and unable to take any physical
        action unless released by the Exalt. The Earth Dragon
        Immaculate must maintain physical contact with the
        target to maintain this immobile state. The Exalted can
        take actions as normal, but all physical tasks are at +1
        difficulty, reflecting the inconvenience of maintaining
        contact with the target of the Avalanche Method.
        Earth-aspected Terrestrial Exalted are totally im-
        mune to this Charm, although they may suffer normal
        physical damage from the blow charged with it. This power
        cannot be channeled through weapons.

        To use this Charm, the martial artist must be standing

        heaves and tosses in response.<br>
        The players of everyone within the invoker's Essence
        x 10 feet must make a reflexive Dexterity + Resistance roll
        with a difficulty equal to the Exalt's Essence as the earth
        shakes and rocks beneath their feet. A character whose
        player fails the roll is thrown violently off his feet and into
        the air, taking one die of bashing damage per point of the
        Immaculate's Martial Arts. This damage is soaked as
        normal. See the rules on knockback and knockdown rules

        After a moment of focus, the Exalt crouches down and
        seems to simply strike the ground with an open palm. But
        far from being a simple strike, shockwaves ripple through
        the ground toward a target of the character's choice. The
        earth beneath opens up like a gaping maw â€” then closes
        back up again with immobilizing force.<br>
        The Immaculate's player should roll his character's
        Strength + Martial Arts in a reflexive opposed roll against
        the target's Wits + Athletics. The target's defense roll is
        reflexive. Each success the Immaculate gets causes the
        target a difficulty penalty of + 1 for any physical activity, as
        well as adding one to the Strength rating of the grip of the
        earth. The impairment continues until the target breaks
        free, and until she breaks free, the target may not move
        from the spot at which the Hungry Earth struck her. The
        victim's player may make a Strength + Athletics roll with
        a difficulty equal to the strength of the earth's grip to free
        herself. This escape attempt takes a full action. If the target
        succeeds, she is free of the Hungry Earth.<br>
        If the character manages to actually exceed the target's
        Strength with the strength of the Hungry Earth, the target
        is sucked down into the ground. She may do nothing
        except try to free herself, and the Strength rating of the
        earth's grip is doubled.<br>
        Additional targets can be affected by the Hungry
        Earth Strike for the price of 1 mote per extra target. The
        Immaculate's player makes one Strength + Martial Arts
        roll, while each target's player gets her own Wits + Athletics
        rolls to evade the cracks. The maximum number of
        targets the Exalt can affect is double her Essence. Obviously,
        the subjects of this Charm must be standing on the
        ground to be affected.

        With a carefully placed melee strike, the Earth
        Dragon warrior infuses a bit of elemental Earth directly
        into a spirit's form, making it solid enough to be affected
        by his attacks.<br>
        To use this Charm, the Immaculate must first be
        Spirit Walking (see page 242). Upon making a successful
        martial arts attack on a spirit, the martial artist's player
        should roll his character's Wits + Martial Arts in a reflex-
        ive opposed contest against the spirit's permanent
        Willpower. If the martial artist loses the contest, the blow
        has no effect. If he wins this contest, the spirit takes no
        damage, but it is dragged into the material world. The spirit
        must first drain its own Essence to pay for the materialization.
        If the spirit's Essence isn't sufficient, the remainder is
        drained from the character. If the Exalt doesn't have
        enough either, the Essence is still lost from both parties,
        but the spirit remains immaterial.<br>
        The spirit must remain materialized for a number of
        hours equal to the Immaculate's Martial Arts Ability. It
        is in all ways a normally materialized spirit that is prohibited
        from dematerializing and can use its Charms as
        normal, assuming it still has enough Essence to do so.
        Should the Immaculate and the spirit tie on the opposed
        roll, the spirit is driven into the material world but need
        remain for only a single turn.<br>
        No spirit likes to be forced into the material
        world, and most spirits are inclined to dramatically
        display this displeasure. Needless to say, Earth-aspected
        Immaculates usually use this move as a prequel to
        destroying the spirit in question.<br>
        This Charm has no effect on spirits with permanent
        Essences higher than the Dragon-Blood's.

        This Charm is the pinnacle of the Earth Dragon Path,
        representing the Immaculate truly becoming one with the
        Earth Dragon â€” if only for a short time. The martial artist
        drops to his hands and knees for a few moments, putting
        himself fully in contact with the elemental Earth. The
        Immaculate's body twists and shifts, his skin becoming rough
        and craggy, his body hardening and calcifying. The Dynast
        becomes a being of living stone for the rest of the scene.<br>
        The affects of this are quite dramatic. The character's
        Strength is doubled by the powerful Earth Essence coursing
        through his body, and blows from the character's fists
        become deadly weapons, with Accuracy, Parry and Damage
        ratings equal to the character's permanent Essence and
        a Speed equal to twice the character's permanent Essence.
        The character's unarmed attacks do lethal damage. The
        Immaculate's granite-like skin also gives enormous protection,
        increasing his lethal and bashing soaks by his
        permanent Essence score and allows him to soak lethal
        damage with his entire Stamina. This protection is incompatible
        with armor but works with any other defensive
        Charms that character may be using. The character also
        ignores the penalties of losing health levels. He still takes
        the damage normally but functions as if unwounded until
        incapacitated. If the character is wounded already when
        invoking Perfect Earth Body, those penalties are eliminated,
        although the damage is not healed.
