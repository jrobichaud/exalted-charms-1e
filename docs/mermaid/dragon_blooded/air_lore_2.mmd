        This Charm is the most basic of Lore techniques
        known by the Dragon-Blooded. Through the use of this
        Charm, the character concentrates on her aligned element,
        centering herself and opening her mind. The Exalt
        can compact a week's worth of learning into a single day,
        assuming she has access to all the necessary materials. This
        Charm can be used on sequential days, but use of it for more
        days than the character's Lore skill causes one level of
        unsoakable lethal damage per day. This damage can only
        be healed by time, and it does not begin healing until one
        week after the characters suffers it.

        Proper knowledge of the Elemental Dragons allows a
        Dynast to draw energy directly from an elemental source,
        restoring depleted reserves in times of crisis.<br>
        The Elemental Empowerment Meditation requires
        the character to spend Willpower points while in contact
        with her aligned element. The character must be able to
        physically touch the element she is aligned with to draw
        Essence from it. For every point of willpower spent in this
        way, the character instantly gains Essence motes equal to
        her Lore. These motes can be spent normally.<br>
        There is a price to be paid for handling elementals
        energy in such a raw fashion. If a character spends more
        Willpower in a single day to draw elemental energy than
        her permanent Essence score, each additional use of Willpower
        to increase her Essence causes one unsoakable level
        of bashing damage.

        In addition to providing raw energy, a Dynast's
        connection to the Elemental Dragons can be a source of
        great resilience and strength in desperate times. Elemental
        Succor Method lets a Dragon-Blood tap into
        the elemental energy of the Dragons to restore her body,
        healing her injuries. That character must be able to
        immerse herself in her favored element to the greatest
        degree possible (standing in a burning fire, submerged
        in water, etc.) and must spend 5 motes and 1 Willpower
        for every lethal health level to be healed of 2 motes per
        bashing health level to be healed. The Elemental Succor
        Method will not restore lost limbs or repair other
        such mutilations.

        The character extends her hand, and a bolt of elemental
        force flashes forth from it â€” a shaft of ice, a blast
        of fire, a barbed wooden javelin, a stroke of lightning or
        slashing shards of crystal. The character's player rolls
        Dexterity + Athletics or Archery (whichever she prefers)
        to hit. This attack has a range of 20 yards x the character's
        permanent Essence, and it does a base damage of 2L for
        every mote of Essence spent. The accuracy of the attack
        is equal to the character's Essence. A character cannot
        spend more motes on this Charm than her Stamina.

        This Charm has effects similar to Elemental Bolt
        Attack but it creates a blast of elemental power rather
        than hurling a bolt. The character's player rolls Dexterity
        Athletics or Archery (whichever he prefers) to hit,
        with an accuracy bonus equal to the character's permanent
        Essence. This attack has a range increment of 20
        yards x the character's permanent Essence. The Elemental
        Burst Technique affects a circular area with a radius
        equal to the character's permanent Essence in yards.
        Anyone in that area who fails to dodge or parry the attack
        takes a base damage of 1L for every more the Dragon-Blooded
        invested in the Charm.

        Rather than just summoning a temporary damaging
        burst of elemental energy, this Charm creates a deadly
        maelstrom of the character's elemental aspect. Whether it
        is a sudden rain of fire, a roiling whirlwind of air or a
        grinding cloud of stone and earth, all within the area of
        effect suffer the character's wrath.<br>
        Anyone in the area of the Dragon Vortex Attack,
        other than the character who summoned it, takes lethal
        damage equal to the character's Essence every turn, as she
        is battered by flying shards of stone, sliced by razor-thin ice
        crystals, burned by swirling gouts of flame, and so on. This
        damage cannot be dodged or parried. The Dragon-Blooded
        who created it is exempt from these effects, and may act
        normally in all respects. The Dragon Vortex extends 10
        feet from the character per point of his permanent Essence.
        It is stationary once invoked, and not even the character
        can voluntarily terminate it before its duration expires,
        although killing the character will end it.

            Diligence and intellect, properly applied, can
            surmount the most difficult of systemic or academic
            pursuits. Diligence and intellect coupled with the
            magical acumen of a talented Exalt can accomplish in
            a matter of hours what could otherwise require months
            of work from a dedicated team of scholars.<br>
            Through the use of this Charm, a Dragon-Blooded
            scholar can virtually guarantee high-quality results on
            any academic or systemic task by using Essence to
            strengthen and structure his thoughts and mind, gain-
            ing a crystalline clarity. For each hour of dedicated
            work and 2 motes of Essence, the Dragon-Blood's
            player gains an automatic success on any roll pertain-
            ing to academic studies, research, analysis or any
            other type of &quot;book work&quot; the character is conducting,
            to a maximum of the character's Lore Ability (including
            specialties, if applicable).<br>
            The hours spent in study for the use of this Charm
            must be concurrent, and any interruption of the
            character's activities will require him to begin anew,
            losing any Essence spent in the Charm's activation.
            Due to the highly structured changes worked on the
            mind by use of this Charm, characters suffer an effective
            -1 penalty to their Compassion Virtue Trait for a
            number of hours after using this Charm equal to the
            number of hours of study (even if the Charm fails due
            to interruption). Those who make repeated, long-term
            use of this Charm grow detached and often cold
            toward others. Storytellers may reduce the Compas-
            sion of characters who rely overmuch on this Charm
            but should warn players if they think their characters
            are overusing the Charm. Generally, more uses per
            lunar month than a character's Essence should be
            considered abuse.

            Sometimes, solutions to complicated problems
            are needed on the spot, without the luxury of analysis
            by engineers or scholars. When a dam or other vital
            structure is damaged, for example, an effective plan
            must be made before the structure fails and further
            hampers normal operating procedures.<br>
            A Terrestrial scholar may bring the full force of
            his mind and accumulated academic training to bear
            on a single problem with the use of this Charm,
            straining his mind with Essence and condensing days
            of analysis into a single, staggering moment of insight.
            For every 2 motes of Essence spent, the character
            may purchase an automatic success on any roll involving
            an analytical or scholarly task, up to a limit
            of his Lore Ability. The remainder of the pool is then
            rolled normally. The character's player must then
            roll to soak, using the Dragon-Blood's Wits At-
            tribute, a number of bashing health levels equal to
            the total successes on the roll, as the Exalt attempts
            to mentally digest and sort the rush of information.
            It is common, after using this Charm, for a character
            to experience violent nosebleeds, sporadic weakening
            of vision and hearing and excruciating headaches.
            Regardless of the results of the soak roll, each use of
            this Charm counts as a full day's exertion for the
            character, who must then deal with the effects of
            sleep deprivation or use a Charm or item to counter
            it. The bashing damage dealt through the use of this
            Charm may be healed using whatever methods are
            available to the character.

            With a potential lifespan of centuries, and those
            centuries almost surely densely packed with all manner
            of both excitement and study, the memories of the
            Dragon-Blooded can become quite cluttered. Dedicated
            scholars especially, who have a long lifetime's
            worth of books and observations on which they likely
            wish to meditate, find that the enervation of the
            memory with Essence can allow them near-perfect
            recall of any event they have witnessed or any mate-
            rial they have read.<br>
            After spending the required Essence, a Dragon-Blood
            spends a moment in contemplation, and his
            player rolls the Exalt's Intelligence + Lore, with the
            number of successes indicating how far into his memory
            the Dragon-Blood may explore. One success is enough
            to recall a hurried conversation from a few years prior,
            while five allows the user to reexperience events from
            primary school. Some savants have even claimed to
            recall memories of time spent in their mothers' wombs
            through the use of this Charm.<br>
            While using this Charm, the character is not
            helpless or unaware of his surroundings, as he is not
            truly immersed in reexperiencing the events of his
            past. He experiences them normally, as memories,
            simply perfectly detailed and accurate memories.

            Individual study, for a savant, may be a relaxing
            and prestigious pastime, regardless of the specific area
            of endeavor. Professional undertakings and the work
            of students do not allow for the slow pace and low
            pressure necessary to produce the results enjoyed by
            those who study for leisure. In such cases, and others,
            it is efficient and effective to establish a hierarchy
            within which the more skilled savants are on hand to
            advise and to proof the work of the lesser savants or
            students. An overseer who uses this Charm can take
            this methodology a step further, weaving connections
            of Essence between herself and those under her to
            maximize the collective cognition of the group.<br>
            On activation of the Charm, the player rolls his
            character's Charisma + Lore. For the remainder of the
            day's study, the character may use these successes as a
            pool from which he can reflexively allocate additional
            dice to rolls made by those under his tutelage, including
            during a roll that has resulted in a failure or botch.
            The character can, for example, add dice one at a time
            to his charge's roll until the pool of extra dice is
            depleted or the charge cancels his botch or failure.
