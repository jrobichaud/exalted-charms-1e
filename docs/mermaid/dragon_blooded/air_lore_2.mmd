        Elemental Concentration Trance<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One day<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Lore: 2<br>
        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        This Charm is the most basic of Lore techniques
        known by the Dragon-Blooded. Through the use of this
        Charm, the character concentrates on her aligned element,
        centering herself and opening her mind. The Exalt
        can compact a week's worth of learning into a single day,
        assuming she has access to all the necessary materials. This
        Charm can be used on sequential days, but use of it for more
        days than the character's Lore skill causes one level of
        unsoakable lethal damage per day. This damage can only
        be healed by time, and it does not begin healing until one
        week after the characters suffers it.

        Elemental Empowerment Meditation<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1+ Willpower<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Minimum Essence: 3<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Elemental Concentration Trance<br>

        Proper knowledge of the Elemental Dragons allows a
        Dynast to draw energy directly from an elemental source,
        restoring depleted reserves in times of crisis.<br>
        The Elemental Empowerment Meditation requires
        the character to spend Willpower points while in contact
        with her aligned element. The character must be able to
        physically touch the element she is aligned with to draw
        Essence from it. For every point of willpower spent in this
        way, the character instantly gains Essence motes equal to
        her Lore. These motes can be spent normally.<br>
        There is a price to be paid for handling elementals
        energy in such a raw fashion. If a character spends more
        Willpower in a single day to draw elemental energy than
        her permanent Essence score, each additional use of Willpower
        to increase her Essence causes one unsoakable level
        of bashing damage.

        Elemental Succor Method<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes and 1 Willpower per lethal health level, 2 motes per bashing health level<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        In addition to providing raw energy, a Dynast's
        connection to the Elemental Dragons can be a source of
        great resilience and strength in desperate times. Elemental
        Succor Method lets a Dragon-Blood tap into
        the elemental energy of the Dragons to restore her body,
        healing her injuries. That character must be able to
        immerse herself in her favored element to the greatest
        degree possible (standing in a burning fire, submerged
        in water, etc.) and must spend 5 motes and 1 Willpower
        for every lethal health level to be healed of 2 motes per
        bashing health level to be healed. The Elemental Succor
        Method will not restore lost limbs or repair other
        such mutilations.

        Elemental Bolt Attack<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote per 2L damage<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Lore: 2<br>
        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        The character extends her hand, and a bolt of elemental
        force flashes forth from it â€” a shaft of ice, a blast
        of fire, a barbed wooden javelin, a stroke of lightning or
        slashing shards of crystal. The character's player rolls
        Dexterity + Athletics or Archery (whichever she prefers)
        to hit. This attack has a range of 20 yards x the character's
        permanent Essence, and it does a base damage of 2L for
        every mote of Essence spent. The accuracy of the attack
        is equal to the character's Essence. A character cannot
        spend more motes on this Charm than her Stamina.

        Elemental Burst Technique<br>

        Prerequisite Charms: Elemental Bolt Attack
        <br>
        This Charm has effects similar to Elemental Bolt
        Attack but it creates a blast of elemental power rather
        than hurling a bolt. The character's player rolls Dexterity
        Athletics or Archery (whichever he prefers) to hit,
        with an accuracy bonus equal to the character's permanent
        Essence. This attack has a range increment of 20
        yards x the character's permanent Essence. The Elemental
        Burst Technique affects a circular area with a radius
        equal to the character's permanent Essence in yards.
        Anyone in that area who fails to dodge or parry the attack
        takes a base damage of 1L for every more the Dragon-Blooded
        invested in the Charm.

        Dragon Vortex Attack<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Rather than just summoning a temporary damaging
        burst of elemental energy, this Charm creates a deadly
        maelstrom of the character's elemental aspect. Whether it
        is a sudden rain of fire, a roiling whirlwind of air or a
        grinding cloud of stone and earth, all within the area of
        effect suffer the character's wrath.<br>
        Anyone in the area of the Dragon Vortex Attack,
        other than the character who summoned it, takes lethal
        damage equal to the character's Essence every turn, as she
        is battered by flying shards of stone, sliced by razor-thin ice
        crystals, burned by swirling gouts of flame, and so on. This
        damage cannot be dodged or parried. The Dragon-Blooded
        who created it is exempt from these effects, and may act
        normally in all respects. The Dragon Vortex extends 10
        feet from the character per point of his permanent Essence.
        It is stationary once invoked, and not even the character
        can voluntarily terminate it before its duration expires,
        although killing the character will end it.
