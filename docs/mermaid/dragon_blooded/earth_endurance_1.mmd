        The Terrestrial Exalted may not be quite as resilient
        as the Anathema they oppose, but they can still take a good
        deal more punishment than normal humans. Like their
        Solar enemies, the Dragon-Blooded may buy extra health
        levels as if they were a Charm.
        Each level of the Dragon-Blooded Ox-Body Technique
        provides one - 1 and one -2 health level. Characters
        cannot take Ox-Body Technique more times than they
        have points of Endurance.

        Unsleeping Earth Meditation<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote<br>

        By simply invoking the strength of the Earth Dragon, a
        Dragon-Blooded using this Charm is able to go without sleep
        for 24 hours without ill effect. The character suffers no penalties
        of any kind during this period due to fatigue from sleep and is
        fully alert. The character still has to rest from physical exertion.
        Using this Charm for more than the character's Essence
        + Endurance days is not recommended. For every
        day past that point, the Exalt loses one temporary Willpower
        per day. This Willpower cannot be recovered until
        he has had at least 24 hours of uninterrupted sleep.

        Stone does not need nourishment, and with this Charm,
        neither do the Dragon-Blooded. A character under the influence
        of this Charm does not need to eat or drink. The Exalted
        functions perfectly well with no nourishment whatsoever and
        suffers none of the penalties associated with hunger.
        Using this Charm for more than the character's Essence
        + Endurance days is remarkably hard on the body. For
        every day past that point, the character loses one bashing
        health level per day, which cannot be healed until use of the
        Charm is discontinued. Most Terrestrial Exalted using this
        Charm for extended periods tend to go without its effects for
        a day or two before reinvoking it.

        The mountains do not breathe, Neither need a Dynast who
        has mastered this Charm. For the rest of the scene after activating
        this Charm, the Dragon-Blooded does not breathe. She can
        survive under water, in clouds of poison gas and in other
        asphyxiating environments with no ill effects whatsoever,
        Keep in mind that, for the duration of the Charm, the
        character is incapable of breathing. This also means that
        speech is out of the question, since the noise of it is caused
        by expelled air. This Charm can be used on others, if they
        are willing. All the character need do to affect a voluntary
        target is to simply touch him.

        The pain and frailty of mortal flesh may be avoided for very
        short periods of time by the invocation of this Charm. Once
        active, the character may ignore all wound penalties fora number
        of tums equal to his Stamina + Endurance. This Charm does
        nothing to actually protect the character from damage â€” it only
        temporarily alleviates the symptoms of injury.

        This Charm roots the Dragon-Blooded's Essence down
        into the elemental Earth, magically sustaining him. As long as
        the Dragon-Blood's feet touch the earth once every two turns,
        he incurs no fatigue whatsoever from any source, whether it be
        armor, encumbrance, great physical exertion or magical effect.
        This Charm does not relieve fatigue already present when it is
        invoked, however. The Dynast under the influence of the
        Charm also may ignore wound penalties up to his permanent
        Essence rating. If the character does not touch the earth at least
        once every two turns, this Charm is instantly disrupted.

        As well as protecting an Exalted's flesh from harm, the
        steady strength of the Earth Dragon can be used to fuel the
        inner flame of vengeance. This Charm is invoked through
        speaking aloud the terms of the vendetta, to which the
        character commits himself with all his soul: The goal must be
        a simply stated purpose such as: &quot;Find the person who killed my
        father&quot; or &quot;Avenge the stain to my honor inflicted upon me
        by the cowardly vassal of the Lord of Singing Birds.&quot;
        Until the terms of the vendetta are fulfilled, the Exalted
        does not need to eat, sleep or rest, so long as he remains in
        pursuit of the vendetta. The character incurs no penalties
        from any sort of fatigue, whether it be magical or natural. He
        will walk tirelessly and fight tirelessly in pursuit of his aim
        and takes no fatigue from armor. He may soak both lethal
        and bashing damage with his Stamina, and he adds his
        Endurance to both his lethal and bashing soaks.<br>
        Unflagging Vengeance Meditation can be sustained without
        ill effect for up to the Exalt's Essence in days. After that, the
        character begins losing one health level of unsoakable bashing
        damage every time his Essence in days passes. The Exalted
        grows pale and draw, his face ser into a mask of vengeance.
        These health levels may be healed only after the Charm is
        allowed to lapse. Healing damage taken from this effect of the
        Unflagging Vengeance Meditation takes twice as longas usual.<br>
        A number of additional characters can join the vendetta
        equal to the Essence of the character initiating the oath. Other
        characters involved must each pay a point of temporary Willpower
        to take the oath. Unflagging Vengeance Meditation ends
        when either the vendetta is satisfied or the individual who
        invoked it consciously stops it. If anyone involved terminates her
        part in the oath prematurely, she takes a number of unsoakable
        levels of lethal damage equal to sum of the permanent Essences
        of the characters involved. This damage may not be reduced in
        any fashion, either with armor or natural protection.
