        The character with Dragon-Graced Weapon can
        impart special properties to the melee weapon in hand by
        merely concentrating for a moment. The effect on the
        character's weapon is based on his elemental aspect, as
        described below. This effect is instantaneous; the Exalt
        must pay Essence for every attack, and he must do so before
        making his attack roll.<br>
        Air: Fierce winds surround the weapon, knocking
        your foe off his feet. A successful hit means the enemy takes
        normal damage and her player must succeed at a Dexterity
        + Athletics roll at difficulty 2 or have her character
        knocked prone.<br>
        Earth: A thunderous shaking of the earth accompanies
        the weapon's strike. The enemy loses two dice
        from all dice pools for physical actions until he's done
        with his next turn.<br>
        Fire: The target bursts into flames and, on his next
        action, must soak another 4L damage from fire. This
        damage is separate from the normal attack and without any
        extra successes added. The fire gutters out after one turn.<br>
        Water: The target is gripped in a drowning embrace.
        Next turn (or this turn, if he hasn't acted yet) subtract 3
        from his initiative total as struggles to clear water from his
        lungs and throat.<br>
        Wood: Thorns cover all the striking surfaces of the
        weapon, and it increases the damage of the attack by + 2L.

        Ghosts and dematerialized spirits cannot be hit by
        ordinary weapons. Though many powerful weapons can
        strike those immaterial beings, warriors caught without
        that kind of armament are in great danger when facing
        spirit foes. This Charm allows a Dragon-Blooded warrior
        to call upon the Dragon of Fire to enchant his weapon,
        allowing it to strike immaterial creatures normally. The
        character must spend the Essence and activate the Charm
        before making her attack, and her player must still roll to
        hit the creature as if it were material. This Charm provides
        no additional bonus beyond allowing the character to hit
        dematerialized spirits.

        With a few seconds' concentration, the Exalted can
        conjure up a weapon created entirely from his favored
        element. This weapon has the same qualities as an ordinary
        weapon of its type; it also has the qualities of a weapon
        enchanted by the Dragon-Graced Weapon Charm (see
        above). As the weapon is created out of raw elemental
        matter and Essence, it does not last for long, but a combat-
        ant can be sure that it will remain intact until the end of
        his current battle. When the scene ends, the elemental
        weapon dissipates, evaporating into a sparkle of light and
        a whiff of the character's aspected element. The conjured
        weapon can be any sort of melee weapon.

        The Exalt with this basic Charm learns how to lend the
        ferocity of fire to his weapon's blows. His hand becomes
        steadier, and his strike truer. Add two dice to the character's
        Melee dice pool for every mote spent; however, a Dragon-Blood
        cannot more than double his Melee Ability with this
        Charm. The player must declare that his character is using this
        Charm and spend the Essence before making the attack roll.

        Fiery sparks leap from the Exalted's weapon, interposing
        themselves between the Exalt and a potentially deadly
        blow. Spend the necessary Essence and roll Dexterity +
        Melee after an opponent's hand-to-hand attack. If even one
        success is achieve, regardless of how many successes the
        Dragon-Blood's opponent achieved, the attack is blocked

        There is a practical limit, imposed by geometry and space,
        on the number of people that can attack a single target at once.
        Although it is unlikely that a Dragon-Blood has ever participated
        in grain threshing, this technique was so named due to its
        similarity to that activity. Only five foes can possibly effectively
        attack a single target simultaneously, and that number is greatly
        reduced should a target find himself in a defensible position -
        his back against a wall, for instance, or standing between two
        trees. With Threshing Floor Technique, the only limit to the
        number of attackers that can assault a single foe in one turn is
        the amount of Essence the Dragon-Blooded spends. The Exalt
        designates a target and spends 2 motes of Essence to activate the
        Charn and l mote of Essence per attacker. Then, so long as an
        attacker is within her ordinary movement distance from the
        target (that is, [Dexterity + 12] &divide; 2 yards), she may make a melee
        attack at the designated target on her normal action; she dashes
        in, makes an attack normally and then pulls back to her
        previous position. Characters so empowered are not required to
        attack the target on their action, though, if they do not, the
        Essence spent to enable them to do so is still lost. Likewise, if the
        target is slain, Essence spent to empower characters who never
        got their shot is also still lost.

        With this Charm, a Dragon-Blooded character can keep
        a foe entirely off-balance until he is slain, if his skill is sufficient
        to the task. The Exalt using Ringing Anvil Onslaught designates
        a single target, and his player rolls the character's Melee
        Ability (no Attribute is added) For each success, the Exalted
        gains an extra attack against the target this turn. The Dynast
        cannot gain more extra attacks than his Melee.

        <br>
        Seen by some as a refinement of Dragon-Graced
        Weapon, Fire Incites Water to a Riot of Clouds allows the
        Dragon-Blood to channel her connection with the element
        of fire through a metal weapon and into a body of water to
        generate a large volume of steam. The moment the Exalt
        activates this Charm and plunges her weapon into a body of
        water at least two feet deep, huge roiling clouds of white
        steam surge from the water around the Dragon-Blood's
        weapon. This steam isn't particularly hot and cannot be
        used to scald others, but it is highly effective at dampening
        opponents and creating a dense, billowing curtain of fog
        through which enemies cannot see. Due to its thickness, this
        fog is equal to fog at night on the visibility table (see Exalted,
        p. 237), limiting those caught in it to a maximum of three
        yards of murky visibility. The Exalt's weapon generates
        another 10 yards of steam each turn it remains in the water.
        The steam will tend to roll away from the Dragon-Blood,
        and in the absence of any prevailing wind, the character can
        make a Willpower roll (difficulty 3) to control which
        direction the cloud of steam billows.<br>
        Using this Charm to supplement an attack on a water
        elemental inflicts aggravated damage.

      It is common in the course of combat for clashing
      weapons to give off sparks. This Charm gives the Exalt the
      ability to direct a spray of sparks into a foe's opponent's
      face any time their weapons clash.
      The Dragon-Blood can use this Charm any time she
      parries or blocks an opponent's metal weapon with her own or
      whenever her weapon hits anything metal or stone in the
      course of combat. Essence multiplies what would normally
      be a few (low Dexterity characters) or attacking (high Dex-
      terity characters) sparks aimed right into her opponent's
      eyes. The opponent will be blinded the following turn (as
      per the poor visibility rules on p. 232 of Exalted).
      Subtracting two successes from all attack rolls made for
      him. The player of the target of the spray of sparks must
      also make a reflexive Wits + Dodge roll to have his
      character turn away from the spray of sparks. If the roll
      succeeds, the Exalt is down only two dice on his next turn's
      attack roll instead of two successes.

        Prerequisite Charms: Ghost-Fire Blade<br>
        <br>
        The Dragon-Blood channels Essence to her weapon
        on an attack, and if that attack succeeds, not only does the
        Exalt cause lethal damage with the blow, she also marks
        the target with a smoking brand that can lead the Exalt to
        her target should the target escape. The brand is difficult
        to hide and smolders through any clothing or for that hides
        it. While the brand cannot burn through metal armor, it
        can make the armor tremendously hot — so much so that
        it's intensely uncomfortable to wear next to the skin. Every
        three turns the target keeps the mark covered with armor,
        he suffers one level of bashing damage (which may be
        soaked as normal). This mark is plainly visible to all who
        see it, including mortals (who see it as a red and inflamed
        tattoo), but the brand also remains visible if the target
        becomes invisible or takes on a new form (making it very
        helpful when dealing with Fair Folk and Lunar Exalts).
        While marked by the spirit brand, the target cannot lose
        his pursuer by non-supernatural evasion techniques,
        and his player suffers a three-die penalty to all Stealth and
        Survival rolls.<br>
        A trail of black spirit smoke pours from the brand,
        which is visible to any who can perceive dematerialized
        spirits or Essence effects. This plume of smoke rolls in the
        direction of the brand's traveler. It cannot be touched or
        smelled, nor can it be dissipated by wind, by hands or
        bodies passing through it or by any natural means.<br>
        The burning mark is usually in the shape of the
        Dragon-Blood's weapon, although some advanced combatants
        have learned to deliver a more personalized
        brand (use the rules for stunting on page
        238, but the roll to mark is reflexive, and the attack does
        damage as normal).

        This Charm allows the Dragon-Blood to adapt perfectly to an opponent's combat style. By watching and
        analyzing an opponent in combat for no fewer than five
        turns (during which she can do nothing else), the Exalt
        reads the subtle strengths and flaws in the target's fighting
        technique and adjusts her own combat style accordingly,
        exploiting the target's weaknesses and defending against
        particular strengths. Roll Intelligence + Melee (or the
        appropriate Ability). This Charm lasts three turns plus two
        turns per success, during which the Dragon-Blood gains a
        bonus of one die per point of permanent Essence on all
        Dodge and Melee rolls made by her character against that
        one stated target.<br>
        Versions of this Charm exist that use Brawl or
        Martial Arts in place of Melee, but the minimum requirement
        of 4 remains the same, and all versions require
        Dodge 4. The Melee, Brawl and Martial Arts versions of
        this Charm must be learned separately. These versions
        are still Melee Charms. They simply analyze an enemy's
        use of different combat Abilities.<br>
        Due to the complexities and mental demands involved
        in reading and analyzing a target so thoroughly, the
        character can only be prepared to fight one opponent who
        has points of Intelligence. This is a dice-adding Charm.
