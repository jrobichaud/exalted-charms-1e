        Everything that walks, flies or swims is in some way
        connected to the earth, and the elements of air and water
        both rest upon the firmament. By grounding her Essence
        into the earth, a Dragon-Blood can greatly increase her
        sensitivity to things around her. Each mote invested in this
        Charm enhances the character's Awareness by two dice
        for a single roll only. The character cannot more than
        double her Awareness with this Charm.

        While under the aegis of this Charm, the character
        cannot be surprised by any means, magical or otherwise.
        This doesn't make her able to see the invisible or anything
        of the sort. It just means that she cannot be struck by an
        attack she is not aware of.<br>
        This Charm can be extended to the character's companions
        by merely spending 2 extra motes per person to be
        so affected. All-Encompassing Earth Sense is not effective
        unless the character is standing on the ground. She need
        not be touching the earth itself - the Charm functions
        just fine inside structures, etc. — but may not be flying,
        swimming and so forth. Engaging in any of these activities
        breaks the Charm immediately.

        By taking a few moments to attune herself to the pulse
        of the Earth Dragon, the Dragon-Blooded invoking this
        Charm can sense the shape of things that sit upon the Earth
        Dragon's back, as well as those beings that walk upon it.<br>
        The Dragon-Blood's player rolls Intelligence + Awareness.
        With a simple success, the character instantly gets a
        complete but vague mental picture of the surrounding
        area, up to her Awareness x 25 feet distant. This mental
        picture includes living beings. Further successes refine the
        image. One success might yield, &quot;The next room is about
        10 x 10 with three humanoid beings in it.&quot; Three successes
        might impart, &quot;The next room is obviously a guardroom,
        containing three Wyld barbarians, each carrying a large
        stone club.&quot; Five successes would yield all of the above
        information, plus estimates of the various strengths of the
        three barbarians, what armor they are wearing and exact
        details on where they are standing.<br>
        To be properly sensed, an object or being must actually
        be touching the earth or touching something directly
        touching the earth in some fashion Objects floating in the
        air or immersed in water would not be affected for instance.
        The range of this Charm is doubled for every additional
        mote of Essence spent. This Charm is especially
        effective underground or in all stone structures, since they
        are actually embraced by the earth. Double the range while
        using the Charm, in such circumstances, and all details of
        the surrounding areas are perceivable.

        Earth is the most static and quiescent of the elements,
        and while it's all encompassing nature enhances the awareness
        of the Earth-aspected Dragon-Bloods, it also allows
        them to suppress this awareness in others.<br>
        This Charm enables a Dragon-Blooded character to
        infuse some of stone's somnolent stasis into another person's
        mind, putting them to sleep. Some Dynasts work this
        Charm by speaking in a low, droning voice; others prefer
        to use a glittering gemstone, such as the jewel in a ring, to
        fix their victim's attention and convey the flow of Essence.
        The character can only bury someone's mind if she can
        keep them sitting still for five minutes, so this Charm calls
        for a fair bit of guile.<br>
        The Dragon-Blood's player rolls Manipulation + Presence,
        with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Simple
        success causes the target to sleep for an hour, and each
        extra success adds one hour to the total. During that time,
        nothing, not noise, light or movement, will awaken the
        victim. You could send the entire Red-Piss Legion past
        with clashing cymbals, and he wouldn't wake up. At the
        end of this period, the victim passes into normal slumber.<br>
        While in the grip of magic sleep, the victim dreams
        strange, still dreams of the caves beneath the earth and the
        mysteries within them. Once in a while, someone wakes up
        afterward knowing where to dig a well that never goes dry
        or the location of a deposit of ore.

        Sense Riding Technique<br>

        A Dragon-Blood truly in tune with the world can
        project her sense into others, riding along and perceiving:
        things from a great distance.<br>
        This Charm is actually three separate Charms, together
        encompassing all of the five senses. The target must
        be visible to the character when the Charm is activated but
        may leave the character's sight after the activation. The
        maximum range at which these Charms function is the
        character's permanent Essence in miles.<br>
        When activated, a roll is made; pitting the Dynast's
        Awareness + Essence against the target's in a reflexive
        opposed roll. The Dynast needs but a single success to
        invoke the Charm. If the Dynast ties the target, there is no
        effect. If the target is an Exalted and beats the Dragon-
        Blood, his player gers to make a reflexive Awareness roll
        with a difficulty of 3 to sense that someone was trying to
        Sense Ride him. Players of normal mortals get no such roll,
        and they remain unaware of the enchantment.<br>
        While Sense Riding, a character may not take any sort
        of disruptive action whatsoever. It is best to sit quietly and
        just observe the sense ridden. Simple actions such as sitting
        on a slowly walking horse may be possible at the Storyteller's
        option, but the character may be in danger of missing
        important details of what is being observed. If the target is
        injured (takes any health levels of damage) while being
        sense ridden, the character takes an unsoakable level of
        bashing damage, and the Charm is disrupted.<br>
        The effects of riding each sense are detailed below:<br>
        Sight: The character may perceive anything the target
        sees, including any magical enhancements that the target
        applies to his own senses while the character is &quot;riding&quot; him.
        The character may only observe through the ridden target's
        eyes. The character cannot use Charms or sorcery or other-
        wise affect the world around the target through the channel
        of the shared sense, though it might provide targeting
        information for some other sort of attack.<br>
        Hearing &amp; Touch: The character may perceive
        anything the target hears or touches, including any magi-
        cal enhancements that the target applies to his own senses
        while the Exalt is &quot;riding&quot; him. This perception does not
        give the Dragon-Blooded the ability to understand languages
        she doesn't know, even if the person being ridden
        understands them.<br>
        Smell &amp; Taste: This Charm is probably the least used
        of the three, but a truly thorough Dynast may wish to leam
        it. When combined with the other three Charms, it
        provides a complete picture of the target's environment
        and surroundings. As with the other (Sense)-Riding
        Charms, the character may perceive anything the target
        does with his sense of smell and taste, including any
        magical enhancements that the target applies to his own
        senses while the character is &quot;riding&quot; him.

        Sense Destroying Method<br>

        <br>
        This Charm is a cluster of three Charms just like
        (Sense) Riding Technique, and it functions in much the
        same way. However, instead of tapping into the target's
        senses, the character simply shuts them down. When this
        Charm is activated, the Dynast's player makes an Essence
        + Awareness roll with a difficulty equal to the target's
        Perception. The effects for each sense are detailed below.<br>
        Sight: Each extra success subtracts one die from the
        target's Awareness rolls relating to sight and adds a -1
        penalty to any task involving sight. If the character's extra
        successes exceed the target's Perception, the target is
        blinded completely for the Charm's duration.<br>
        Hearing & Touch: Each success subtracts one die
        from the targer's Awareness rolls relating to these senses
        and allows him to ignore one level of wound penalties. If
        the character's roll exceeds the target's Perception, the
        target is rendered completely deaf but also suffers no
        wound penalties for the Charm duration. Some enterprising
        Dynasts use this Charm on their minions before
        sending them into combat — but are careful to give them
        explicit instructions before doing so.<br>
        Smell & Taste: Each success subtracts one die from
        the target's Awareness rolls relating to these senses. If the
        Exalt gains more successes than the target's Perception, he
        is rendered completely unable to smell or taste for the
        Charm's duration.<br>
        A Dynast may not use this Charm on herself.

        After perfecting the art of suppressing another's physical
        sense, a truly skilled Earth-aspected Dynast can actually
        use his own Essence to suppress his victim's ability to
        perceive and manipulate Essence. The character must pay
        the base cost of the Charm, plus any additional motes. The
        maximum number of additional motes that the Exalt can
        spend is equal to her permanent Essence.<br>
        Her player then makes an Awareness + Essence roll with
        a difficulty of 3 for the Exalt to correctly judge the patterns of
        Essence around the target, who must be insight and no farther
        away than 10 x the character's permanent Essence in feet. If
        the roll succeeds, the player makes a Willpower + Essence roll
        against a difficulty of the target's Essence. Each extra success
        on this toll adds I mote to the cost of all Charms and sorcery
        used by the target, to a maximum penalty equal to the amount
        of extra Essence the character spent activating this Charm.<br>
        This surcharge applies to.every activation ofa Charm,
        meaning it may be paid multiple times per turn if an Exalt,
        for example, uses reflexive defensive Charms, If Combos
        are involved, then the surcharge is applied to every Charm
        in the Combo, every time one of those Charms is activated.
        The effects of the Charm linger for a number of
        turns equal to the Exalt's permanent Essence.
