        The victims of this Charm drown on dry land, locked
        into a fierce clinch with the Exalt. Survivors of the
        assault actually cough up water from their lungs. This
        Charm must be used in conjunction with a clinch attack
        against the target. The Dragon-Blooded's clinch does
        lethal rather than bashing damage. For each successive
        turn the clinch is maintained and this Charm is invoked,
        the clinch does an additional + 1L damage. Stopping the
        use of this Charm for even a turn will reset the damage of
        the clinch to normal.

        Riptide Method<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote per attack/foe<br>
        Duration: One turn<br>
        Type: Extra Action<br>

        A brawler using this Charm is capable of wrestling up
        to four opponents at once — theoretically, one for each
        limb, though combatants of particularly large girth may
        simply immobilize opponents with their bulk.
        The Exalt's player makes Dexterity + Brawl rolls to
        initiate the attacks, which must be clinches or holds. Each
        attack costs a single mote, each must be made against a
        different target, and the Exalt may not make more than four
        such attacks. The targets may dodge or parry as normal,
        meaning that some may escape while others may not.
        In subsequent turns, the Dragon-Blood may, after
        initiative is rolled but before anyone acts, spend Essence to
        keep this Charm active. Again, the cost is 1 mote per
        already-restrained victim per turn. If the character has less
        than four victims and others are still within reach, then on
        his action, he may pay more motes and attempt to put them
        in clinches or holds.
        If the Exalt does not pay the motes of Essence each
        turn to maintain the assault, then he must let some of the
        grappled opponents free. The Dragon-Blood may not
        move while using this Charm after the initial assault — his
        Victims must come to him.

        Pounding Surf Style<br>

        Cost: 1 mote<br>

        Type: Supplemental<br>

        <br>
        Not even the Blessed Isle is immune to the inexorable
        power of water, as it is slowly shaped over the eons
        by the pounding of the waves. A Dragon-Blood emulates
        the repeated crashing of the surf with this style, wearing
        down the protection of his foe's armor with a flurry of
        blows. The Exalt makes a Brawl attack. Damage for the
        first such attack that lands ignores one point of the
        target's soak. If the character uses this Charm and strikes
        the target again later in the scene, each successive such
        blow ignores a an additional point of soak. Thus, on the
        second successful attack, the character would be at -2
        soak and on the third attack, -3. The target's armor is not
        physically damaged, just temporarily compromised to the
        benefit of the attacking Dragon-Blood— no other at
        -tackers gain this benefit, and the armor penalties do not
        last past the end of the scene.

        A Dragon-Blood using this Charm attacks her enemies to
        all sides with lightning-quick, accurate strikes. Each extra attack
        costs 2 motes. The Exalt must be facing multiple opponents, and
        she must attack each opponent at least once. She cannot launch
        more attacks in a turn than she has dots of Brawl.

        The average street brawler quickly falls back before any
        sharp pointy object waved at him. A true student of the art,
        however, can turn aside armed blows without dismay. Upon
        activating this Charm, the user may parry any incoming
        brawl, martial arts or melee attacks with his Brawl, including
        specialties, and with no penalty or harm for fighting unarmed.

        This Charm turns the Dragon-Blood's brawling strikes into
        deadly, crushing blows that are extremely difficult for an unarmed
        opponent to turn aside. A punch or kick delivered with
        this Charm does lethal damage rather than bashing and is treated
        as an attack with a weapon for the purpose of parrying. As usual,
        additional strikes made using this Charm during the same turn
        require that the Essence cost of the Charm be paid again.

        A master brawler unafraid to go toe to toe with a powerful
        enemy can use this Charm to aid her allies' attacks. While
        applying a hold to her foe, she exposes him to greater harm
        while keeping her own limbs more or less out of the way.
        After the Exalt makes a successful hold attack, she may
        use her extra successes on that roll to reduce her enemy's
        lethal and bashing soak totals by that amount until her next
        action or until the enemy breaks the hold. The result may be
        maintained through additional turns by paying two additional
        motes. Once each turn the hold is maintained, the
        Dragon-Blood's player may roll her character's Essence. Every
        success on this roll further reduces the target's soak by a point.
        The Exalt is not normally harmed by attacks aimed at the held
        foe, although a botched attack may still injure her.
