        Spirit Sight<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>
        Minimum Martial Arts: 3<br>
        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        As mentioned previously, a basic part of Immaculate
        training is that of interacting with the spirit world. The
        first step in this training is to comprehend how to perceive
        the spirit world. This ability is gained as part of the basic
        training of a Dragon Path, whether the Exalt becomes an
        Immaculate during character creation or joins the Order
        later in life. Possessing it is a requirement for learning the
        Charms on the Dragon Path.<br>
        The practical upshot of this is that by spending a
        single mote of Essence, an Immaculate can perceive spirits
        and incorporeal beings. Normally invisible spiritualized
        beings become visible to the Spirit Walker. This power
        lasts for an entire scene â€” or until the Exalt consciously
        reattunes herself to the normal world. Reattuning to the
        normal world is a dice action.<br>
        Tuning in to the spirit world does tend to distract
        one from the concerns of the material one though. The
        Exalt invoking this ability suffers a +1 to the difficulty
        of any activity relating to the corporeal world while
        using Spirit Sight.

        Spirit Walking<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 3 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Martial Arts: 3<br>
        Minimum Essence: 3<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Spirit Sight<br>

        The Immaculates are widely known for their ability
        to interact with and combat spirits. By merely concentrating
        for a moment, a properly trained Dragon-blood
        can do more than just see the spirit world. She can &quot;Spirit
        Walk,&quot; mystically attuning herself to the spirit world on
        a physical level.
        This Charm allows the Immaculates who know it to
        interact with spirits as if they were normal corporeal
        beings. Physical damage dealt by a Spirit Walker that
        would normally pass right through a spirit's immaterial
        form affects it as if the spirit were flesh and blood, as do
        the Charms and abilities of the Exalted. The Immaculate
        is still in the physical world, however, and has to deal
        with any physical limitations that may apply. Also,
        unless the Immaculate uses Spirit Sight, she cannot see
        dematerialized spirits.
        Spirit Walking puts the character truly in tune with
        both the spiritual world and the corporeal one. When
        Spirit Walking is used with Spirit Sight, the +1 penalty to
        difficulties for physical world action is negated.
