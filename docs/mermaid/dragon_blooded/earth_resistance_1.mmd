        Strength of Stone Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 2 motes per person<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>

        <br>
        One of the most notable traits of the element of Earth
        is its strength and resistance to damage. Through this
        Charm, a Dragon-Blooded can take on some of the strength
        and hardness of stone and share it with other people.
        After a short meditation spent holding and concentrating
        upon the Essence within a pebble, the character
        becomes stronger and tougher, gaining one dot each of
        Strength and Stamina for the next five minutes. If the
        Dragon-Blooded character wants to include other people
        in the Charm, they must all hold hands in a circle with a
        pebble between each pair of palms. A character can only
        benefit from one application of Strength of Stone Technique
        at a time.

        With this Charm in effect, a Dragon-Blood's skin
        gains the toughness of the native rock of the earth itself.
        Swords and arrows glance from her skin as if off a cliff face.
        Every mote of Essence invested in the Charm give the
        character two points of additional soak against lethal and
        bashing damage. The bonus to soak cannot be greater than
        the character's Essence. This Charm is weak against Essence
        and does not apply to damage caused by sorcery or by
        attacks enhanced with Charms.

        Through this Charm, a Dragon-Blooded character
        links his own Essence to the Essence within any great mass.
        By inverting the principles of resistance against the mass, it
        enables him to exert vastly magnified strength. After a
        moment's concentration, the Dynast can hurl boulders,
        topple pillars, stomp on the edge of a cliff to start a
        landslide or perform other momentary feats of superhuman
        strength. In game terms, for one turn, the character's
        Strength increases by 5, but he can only apply that extra
        Strength to objects made of earth or stone. This height-
        ened Strength may be used in an attack (for instance,
        throwing a boulder at an opponent for Strength-based
        damage), and jade-alloy weapons such as daiklaves are
        &quot;stone&quot; enough to benefit from the effects of this Charm.

        This is actually a cluster of five separate Charms, each
        offering protection from the harmful effects of the element
        of one of Five Immaculate Dragons. While this Charm in
        effect, the character gets a bonus to lethal and bashing soak
        equal to her Essence when attacked by an appropriate
        source of elemental damage. This soak applies to attacks as
        well as to environmental damage (from say drowning;
        crushing rock or molten lava). For the purposes of this
        Charm, metal is earth and fists, teeth and other natural
        attacks are wood. As with Impervious. Skin of Stone
        Meditation, this protection is brittle and offers no additional
        resistance against attacks enhanced with Charms or
        against damage caused by sorcery.<br>
        These Charms must be each bought separately. A
        character may apply the discount for buying Charms of her
        own elemental attunement when learning the protection
        technique for her element.

        The disruptive predations of beings and creatures of
        the Wyld are a constant danger to the Realm. Naturally,
        the Dynasts of Earth - paragons of stability - have
        developed methods for combating these roiling energies.
        For the remainder of the scene after invoking this Charm,
        a Dynast may ignore the warping effects of the Wyld. Both
        his person and his gear are protected and cannot be
        mutated or changed by Wyld effects. The character can
        extend this protection to others by paying the full cost of
        the Charm and touching them.

        methods to shield themselves from the powerful magic of the
        Anathema. For the remainder of the scene after invoking this
        Charm, a Dynast may add her Essence to the difficulty of
        magical attacks made against her by the Anathema. This
        includes both Charm-enhanced attacks and sorcery. These
        are effective automatic successes to avoid the attack and are
        additive with dodges and parries. This Charm offers no
        protection against more subtle effects, such as mind control.

        The Exalt focuses, invoking the durability of the Earth
        as an enchantment upon his armor. The degree of benefit
        depends on the composition of his armor according to the
        table below. The Exalt can extend this Charm to any ally
        within his (Essence x 3) yards by paying the same cost, and
        a character may simultaneously evoke protection on as
        many allies within range as his Essence reserves permit.
        Characters may only benefit from one application of this
        Charm at a time and immediately lose the enchantment if
        they remove their armor for any reason.<br>

            Like the lesser (Element) Protection Form upon
            which this Charm builds, Mantle of (Element) Invulnerability
            is actually a cluster of five separate Charms that
            must be purchased separately. Each confers unsurpassed
            protection, allowing the Exalt to completely ignore all
            non-magical sources of injury associated with the respective
            element and adding the character's permanent
            Essence to her soak against magical attacks involving the
            element. This Charm uses the same guidelines for determining
            the elemental association of a damage source as
            (Element) Protection Form (see Exalted: The Dragon-Blooded, p. 201).<br>
            Dragon-Blooded always consider the Mantle of (Element)
            Invulnerability for their own element to be a
            favored Charm, even if they do not actually have Resistance
            as an Aspect or Favored Ability. However, because
            this Charm is still based on Resistance, Earth Aspects
            never pay an elemental surcharge to use any of the five
            elemental permutations.

            The Exalt dons the fivefold aegis of the Elemental
            Dragons, his anima roaring out in a gale of destructive
            power as if he had spent 16+ motes of Peripheral
            Essence. For the rest of the scene, the character is at one
            with the harmony of the elements and suffers no damage
            from any non-magical object or force native to the
            Tapestry of Creation. Beings and forces from outside of
            Fate can hurt the character normally by mundane
            means, but all others must use magically enhanced
            attacks or weapons of the Five Magical Materials to
            harm the Exalt. Unlike the individual Mantle of (Element)
            Invulnerability Charms, Perfected Scales of the
            Dragon offers no additional soak versus damage sources
            that penetrate its limited perfection.

        The Dragon-Blood kneels in humble supplication
        to the Elemental Dragons, briefly setting aside his
        authority as a Prince of the Earth to become a vessel of
        greater divinity. As the Charm activates, a sphere of
        living Essence spreads from the Chosen's heart and
        grows to envelop a radius of her Essence in yards. Taint-Cleansing
        Technique cannot be placed in a Combo but
        may be used synergistically. In order to obtain the
        synergistic benefit, all participant Dragon-Blooded must
        stand in an outward-facing circle with each no more
        than five yards from all other participants. The total
        number of participants cannot exceed the Essence +
        Performance + applicable specialty (usually Leadership)
        of the Exalt leading the combined effort. A
        synergistic use of this Charm combines the spheres of
        Essence from each character into a single sphere emerging
        from the center of the participant circle. This
        sphere has a radius in yards equal to the (highest
        Essence in the group) x (the number of participants).<br>
        Within the radius of the sphere, the energy of the
        Wyld is completely displaced, turning the affected
        area into a bubble of perfect and inviolate stability.
        Every decade of contact with the Wyld erodes one
        foot of radius from the protected region. Fair Folk and
        Wyld mutants can freely enter regions of stability
        created with Taint-Cleansing Technique without suffering
        any more harm than they experience in any
        other part of Creation.
