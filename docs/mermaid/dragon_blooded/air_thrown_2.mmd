        Seeking Throw Technique<br>

        Cost: 1 mote per two dice<br>

        Close alignment with the element of Air considerably
        simplifies the task of hurling deadly objects at opponents.
        With an infusion of Essence, the Dragon-Blooded forges a
        path through the air to her target, ensuring her missile's
        true and deadly flight. For each mote of Essence spent on
        the Seeking Throw, the player may add two dice to a
        Thrown attack roll. This cannot increase the character's
        dice pool by more than her Thrown Ability rating. The
        player must declare how much Essence she is infusing into
        the Charm before making the attack roll.

        This Charm allows an Exalt to ensure that a particularly
        valuable weapon (or weapons) will return safely to
        her hand. When she first hurls the weapon, the Dynast
        attaches an invisible rope of wind to it, pulling it back to
        her hand when it's path is spent. Whether it hits its target
        or not, a Loyal Weapon instantly flies back through the air
        to the character's hand, available for use next turn.<br>
        This Charm works on any weapon at all, not just those
        usually thrown. A daiklave may be hurled as easily as a
        group of shuriken. Melee weapons thrown using this Charm
        have the same accuracy, speed and damage as they would
        if melee weapons and a range in yards equal to 10 rimes the
        character's Essence; but they use the character's Thrown
        Ability, rather than her Melee.<br>
        Anyone in the weapon's path, other than the target,
        may attempt to grab the weapon as his action, assuming:
        that he has an action available. The weapon can be caught
        with a successful Dexterity. + Athletics roll, but the player
        of the character catching the weapon must succeed at an
        immediate, reflexive opposed Strength + Athletics roll.

        <br>
        Currents of elemental Air can be used to sustain a
        thrown missile's deadly flight long after its energy would
        normally be spent. The character infuses the Essence of air
        into an item and hurls it at his opponent as normal. But
        unlike a normal hurled attack, this thrown weapon takes
        on a life of it's own, continuing to circle and attack for a
        number of turns equal to the attacking character's Essence.<br>
        A weapon or item enchanted with Persistent Hornet
        Attack strikes a single target each turn with the
        attacking character's Perception + Thrown skill. The
        weapon acts on the same initiative as the character's
        each turn. Once a weapon has been assigned a target,
        the character can't change the target. The weapon can
        be attacked as if it was a normal character, but the
        difficulty to hit it is the throwing character's Essence. If
        struck, the weapon does not soak â€” it is immediately
        knocked from the air and become inert.<br>
        The character must declare he is invoking this Charm
        when he first throws the weapon it is used on. If the
        attacker uses Persistent Hornet Attack as part of a Combo,
        the daggers must repeat the use of the other Charms in the
        Combo exactly. The character should pay the cost of the
        additional Charms each time the dagger uses them, but
        need not pay the Willpower every turn.

        <br>
        To invoke this potent Charm, the character simply
        tosses a weapon (or weapons) into the air and sends it
        Elsewhere for later use. At a later time, the Exalted can
        release the weapon back into the material world. The
        weapon must be designed to be thrown and be of a type that
        the Dragon-Blooded is actually familiar with and skilled in
        throwing himself.<br>
        Attacking with one or more of these waiting weapons
        is a reflexive action that must be done at the same time that
        the character takes his regular action, and it can be done
        in conjunction with any other normal simple action.
        Aside from that fact, it is a normal, reflexive Dexterity
        + Thrown attack, which can be modified by
        Charms as usual. The waiting weapons may be used as
        part of a Combo, but the Combo can only apply to the
        hidden weapons, cannot include an Extra Attacks-type
        Charm and must include every hidden weapon called up
        in the turn.<br>
        There is no limit to the number of weapons concealed
        by the Invisibly Hidden Chakram Method that a Dragon-
        Blood can release in one turn, and each is thrown with the
        Exalt's full Dexterity + Thrown pool at the time of its
        appearance. The hidden weapons originate from the
        character's location and are clearly part of an attack on
        that character's part. A Dragon-Blooded character can
        maintain as many invisibly hidden weapons as his Essence
        Trait x 2. These weapons are as impossible to sense as
        anything hidden Elsewhere.

        directed at a character using Whirlwind Shield, the

        make a ranged attack roll against the target.
        This Charm can be used upon a group if the
        character so wishes, but characters so protected must
        remain within range of the character's perception.
        The Exalted must commit an additional mote per

        Beyond just deflecting an enemy's attack, Vengeful
        Gust Counterattack lets a character strike back at the one.
        assaulting her. Upon being made the target of a ranged
        attack that she is aware of, the player of a character that.
        knows this Charm may make an immediate Dexterity +
        Thrown check as an opposed defensive roll in place of a
        dodge or parry attempt.<br>
        If this roll exceeds the attacker's roll, the missile's path
        is reversed. It is hurled back to its point of origin, striking
        with a number of successes equal to the extra successes on
        the defending character's player's Dexterity + Thrown roll.
        This Charm is not an all-or-nothing proposition.
        Even if the defender fails to score extra successes on her
        Dexterity + Thrown roll, she still subtracts the successes
        she got from the attacker's roll, just as if the character was
        dodging or parrying the attack.<br>
        If the Exalt has Whirlwind Shield Form active when
        she activates Vengeful Gust Counterattack, the character's
        Essence is subtracted from the atrack before the results of
        the Dexterity + Thrown roll are applied to it, allowing
        stronger counterattacks. If the character is the target of an
        area-of-effect attack such as the Death of Obsidian Butterflies,
        the Whirlwind Shield Form protects only her own
        person, but the attack can still be deflected. This means
        that, for example, a sorcerer who targets multiple Air-aspected
        Dragon-Blooded with such a spell may be struck
        multiple times with its effect due to this Charm.

        Once sufficient connection with the Air Dragon has
        formed, the skilled Dragon-Blooded can move beyond
        even the need for a weapon to throw at his opponent. By
        infusing the air itself with Essence, the character solidifies
        it, forming indistinct yet glittering patterns of icy wind â€” weapons
        from the very substance of air itself. Such insubstantial
        weapons are too unstable for melee combat, but
        they are eminently suited for ranged attacks.<br>
        A wind weapon has a base damage and accuracy equal
        to the character's permanent Essence and a range equal to
        10 times this value. It is also possible to create more than
        one wind weapon at once, so long as the Essence cost is
        paid for each. The maximum number of weapons that can
        be created in a single turn with this Charm is equal to the
        character's permanent Essence.<br>
        Once created, the wind weapon is thrown as a reflexive
        action, using the characters Dexterity + Thrown, plus
        the accuracy of the weapon and any appropriate modifiers
        for ranged attack. If multiple weapons are created, they
        are all thrown at once and can be thrown at one or at
        multiple targets. The wind weapons can't be handed to
        anyone else or used in melee combat. This Charm cannot
        be put in a Combo with Extra Action type Charms, If the
        character throws multiple wind weapons, each is thrown at
        his full dice pool.<br>
        Wind Weapons have real substance for the Charm's
        short duration and can be used for purposes other than
        simple attacks. For instance, a wind knife can sever a rope
        or knock an item out of someone's hand as easily as any
        other thrown knife can.

        By further refining the control needed to form a
        Whirlwind Shield, the character learns to form invisible
        armor from the surrounding air. While a Whirlwind Shield
        only protects against ranged weapons, Wind Armor Technique
        forms a barrier to any assault upon the character.<br>
        The Wind Armor has a 1B/1L soak rating for every
        mote of Essence committed to it and has no mobility
        penalty or fatigue value. Wind Armor appears as a cocoon
        of violently swirling winds surrounding the character
        invoking it. The maximum rating of this armor is the
        character's permanent Essence. This armor is fully com-
        patible with and additive to physical armor.<br>
        Wind Armor Technique can also be used on others,
        but they cannot move farther than 5 x the Exalt's permanent
        Essence in yards away, or the effect immediately
        fades. The use of this Charm on others is at the normal
        price - one mote per 1L/1B of the armor â€” and must be
        spent for every target armored.

            This is the first of what are collectively known as
            the Crosswind Techniques, a group of Charms predicated
            on emulating and channeling Essence in a
            manner similar to the Essence within the very wind,
            first taught centuries ago by their creator,
            &quot;Windtamer&quot; Cynis Mond. The eccentric innovator
            no longer teaches the Techniques he once claimed
            were mere by-products of his other studies of the
            Essence of the winds, but the collection of Charms is
            so widespread today that instruction is available
            practically anywhere.<br>
            The Crosswind Offense is a technique by which a
            Terrestrial may imbue both weapon and throw with
            windlike Essence in order to guide the throw accurately
            in a wide arc instead of a straight line, with the
            purpose of bypassing a shield or cover with a lateral
            attack. This technique costs 1 mote of Essence per
            difficulty penalty due to shields or cover bypassed.

            weapon to the target.&quot; These are Windtamer's words
            on the subject of this Charm, often quoted by teachers
            of this technique. Activating this Charm, the Exalt
            uses a feinted attack to trick a target into dodging into
            a second attack, the true attack.<br>
            To use this Charm, the attacking character
            splits his action into two actions. The player rolls
            one attack using his character's Manipulation +
            Thrown at -2 dice with a difficulty of 1. If this
            attack is successful, it does no damage, but instead,
            note the extra successes rolled on the attack. The
            second action is a normal Dexterity + Thrown
            attack at -3 dice. The extra successes on the first
            roll reduce the target's dice on any attempts to
            dodge the second throw.
