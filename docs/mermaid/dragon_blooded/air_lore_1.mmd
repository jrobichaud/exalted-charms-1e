        This peculiar Charm finds use among Dragon-Bloods
        who worry about thieves. It takes a clever hand, though, to
        trap a fire inside a box, jar or bottle so that it can't go out.
        The Dynast must place a bit of fuel inside the container —
        firedust from the far south works best — set it on fire, then
        slap the lid shut and seal it just right. When someone opens
        the container, the captive fire explodes, much larger and
        hotter from anger at being trapped. A typical use for the
        fire trap is to rig it inside a trunk or cupboard so that anyone
        who opens it the wrong way pops open the hidden container
        and set off the trap.<br>
        Like most Charms with long-term effects, the fire trap
        &quot;ties up&quot; the mote of Essence used to set it up. For this
        reason, the Aspects of Fire do not manufacture fire traps by
        the dozen. Creating a fire trap takes just a minute, but the
        trap itself can last indefinitely. The trap lasts even after its
        creator's death, if she never reclaimed its Essence. The fire
        trap's explosion has a three-foot radius. The player rolls
        Dexterity + Lore. As well as causing a flash and loud bang,
        for each success the player rolls, the trap does a number of
        points of lethal damage equal to the Essence of the Exalted
        who set the trap, soaked normally. Obviously, fire traps are
        unsuitable for guarding anything that flame could destroy.<br>
        Cascade Charms:<br>
        • The Fire Blast Trap Trick needs few improvements.
        One possibility is an improved fire trap whose flame fills a
        larger area.
