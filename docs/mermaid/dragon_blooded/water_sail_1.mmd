        Bounding Main Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes<br>
        Duration: 1 hour<br>
        Type: Supplemental<br>
        Minimum Sail: 2<br>
        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        Dynasts attuned to Water can become some of the
        world's greatest sailors. The Charm makes every sailing
        task just a little bit easier: The wind doesn't die or shift at
        awkward moments, there always seems to be a current in
        the desirable direction, and crewmembers do their jobs
        with skill and efficiency.<br>
        In game terms, every two successes rolled with this
        Charm (rounded up) cancel out one difficulty penalty
        from a Sail-based feat. Thus, if the Storyteller rules that
        threading the narrow, stormy Straits of Hell normally
        would be difficulty 3, one or two successes with this Charm
        would reduce the difficulty to 2, and three or four successes
        would reduce the task to normal difficulty. The player
        must still make Ability rolls and gain at least a simple
        success for tasks, but does not suffer penalties for adverse
        conditions.<br>
        Multiple characters cannot add together successes
        rolled for this Charm. Only the roll with the greatest
        number of successes counts. For instance, if two characters
        both use Bounding Main Technique and one rolls two
        successes while the other rolls three, only the second
        character's Charm has any effect.<br>
        Cascade Charms:<br>
        • A more powerful version of this Charm extends
        over multiple ships, at least if they stay fairly close together.<br>
        • A more skilled and powerful sailor could reverse this
        Charm and use it against an enemy, adding difficulty
        penalties for any sailing task. On the high sea, this merely
        hinders a ship— it doesn't move as quickly, the crew seems
        clumsy and stupid, and so on. Moderately risky tasks (such
        as sailing a narrow passage between rocky shoals) can
        become incredibly dangerous.

        With a look at the sky, the Exalted can predict the
        weather for the next day or so; his empathy with the
        currents of the ocean and air give him real prescience
        regarding the weather. The Charm will fail if the local
        weather is changing in response to a magical event or
        sorcery; this Charm only describes to the character
        what the natural weather will be if nothing unusual
        takes place. Perceptive Dragon-Blooded can sometimes
        use this Charm to predict events other than the
        weather: If, for instance, Admiral Potan's fleet is pre-
        paring to sail on a rebellious prefecture as soon as a
        storm breaks, the user of this Charm can predict
        exactly when they will set sail. And impossibly heavy
        clouds appearing out of clear blue skies might be a
        harbinger of an impending volcanic eruption. This
        Charm only works when the character is on the water;
        it fails when the Exalted's feet are on land.

        When time is of the essence and getting a ship into
        safe harbor is more important than the crew's rest and
        safety, a captain or pilot with Storm-Outrunning Technique
        is essential to survival and success. This Charm
        allows a ship's officer to double that ship's rate of
        movement for the current scene. This may enable a
        small ship to beat an enemy fleet to a friendly port,
        giving the city some warning; it may let a ship beat a
        storm to safety; or it may let a crew of merchants beat
        a rival to a choice port. To activate the Charm, the
        Exalt need only spend the necessary Essence. The
        greatly increased speed may require one or more Sail
        rolls, especially if the ship cruises through hazardous
        waters at double normal velocity. Also, note that if
        this Charm is used from the deck of a becalmed sailing
        ship it will have no effect, as a speed of zero, when
        doubled, remains zero.

        The finest captains and pilots can thread their ships
        through the most dangerous patches of sea, avoiding
        submerged hazards with flair and panache. This Charm is
        the source of more than one pilot's reputation. With it, an
        Exalt gains an instinctive knowledge of any submerged
        hazards within five miles of the ship's current location, as
        well as the prevailing current, danger spots and safe channels
        in the same radius. The net effect of this knowledge is
        that the pilot's Sail dice pool improves by three dice for the
        remainder of the scene for the purpose of avoiding hazards.
        This Charm does not directly protect the ship from such
        hazards: If the pilot makes a bad mistake, the hull might
        still be rent asunder. It also does not give its user any special
        awareness of the activities of other characters: It cannot
        point out an ambush in a narrow passage or the impending
        arrival of an enemy vessel.

        A Charm favored by Wood-aspected sailors, Sturdy
        Bulkhead Concentration enhances the strength of a ship's
        hull without making it heavier. When this Charm is
        active, the hull gains three additional health levels and 2
        additional soak. The benefit only remains as long as the
        Exalted who activated the Charm remains aboard the
        vessel. To activate the Charm, the character needs only to
        spend the necessary Essence while aboard the ship.

        Whenever a ship under the command of a Dragon-Blooded
        with this Charm comes into contact with hostile ships
        of any stripe, it is temporarily camouflaged as a ship of that
        allegiance: The ship appears to be a merchantman to those
        aboard merchantmen; it looks as a pirate ship does to pirates;
        and so on. The Charm is largely a visual illusion — the vessel's
        flag changes its appearance, and the crew appears, from a
        distance, to be the appropriate sort of crew for a ship of its type.
        The Charm does not change the line of the ship itself, so one
        cannot, for instance, hide an imperial dreadnought among
        fishing smacks and expect to go unnoticed. The Charm also
        fails should any viewer set foot upon the ship; visitors and
        raiders see the ship as it really is, once they are aboard it.

            By pursing her lips and whistling as she invokes this
            Charm, an Exalt can call the winds into the sails of her ship
            and escape from a dangerous situation — or hurl herself into
            battle. The wider the sails and the mightier the ship, the
            more winds are called, as the spirits of the air hasten to obey
            the Exalt, until the ship is moving at full speed in the desired
            direction. The winds are intensely localized and will affect
            other ships within a couple hundred meters of the Exalt's
            ship. However, they cannot be commanded to alter their
            direction once summoned. The ship may run before the
            wind or tack into it, but it cannot turn back on itself. The
            winds will cause the ship to move at its full rate of speed,
            depending on the type of ship, and will last for up to a scene.

            When this Charm is activated, all those who see the
            ship on which the Exalt stands perceive it as an awesome
            naval battleship, haloed with strange lights and manned by
            deadly warriors —even if it's a rickety old piece of wood held
            together by worn-out nails and crewed by the sweepings of
            the local port. While common sense cuts in a moment later
            and the ship is clearly visible as what it actually is, the players
            of all those who were looking at the ship when the Charm
            took effect must succeed in a reflexive Willpower roll for the
            characters to attack it. This Charm is normally used in order
            to gain the advantage of surprise. A wise captain can have
            half the enemy crew slaughtered before it manages to pull
            itself together and fight back.

            By spending 5 motes of Essence and invoking this
            Charm, an Exalt can whisper his name into the waves
            around his vessel, and it will be carried to all sea spirits,
            pelagials or other sentient inhabitants of the ocean within
            five miles of his ship. All those who have no particular and
            personal reason to hate that Exalt will be instinctively
            reminded of the power and authority of the Exalted and will
            travel to the vessel to pay their respects and to find out why
            the Exalt has declared his presence. Particularly powerful
            creatures or minor gods may send a representative rather
            than attend themselves. This Charm can be used while at
            port, but fewer creatures of the sea are likely to answer the
            summons. Any beings who will arrive do so within half an
            hour at the most. Their behavior and the length of time they
            remain depends upon the attitude or requests of the Exalt.

            By invoking this Charm, the Exalt summons a great
            swarm of lampreys and similar clinging creatures, which
            adhere to the hull of the target ship, slowing it and possibly
            even causing it to founder if the weather conditions are
            exceptionally bad. The target ship, which must be within
            a mile of the Exalt, has its speed reduced by 10 percent for
            every mote of the Exalt's permanent Essence and will
            remain at this reduced speed until its hull is cleaned or for
            a week, whichever is sooner. This may require a formal dry-docking,
            if the crew has no facilities to do so at sea. This
            Charm fails to work on any ships whose hulls are crafted
            from the Five Magical Materials or other imperishable
            First Age materials, though the Essence is still lost, as such
            ships are of too noble a substance to be so fouled.

            This Charm invokes the powers of the Exalted to
            disguise the ship, clothing it in the appearance of an ally —
            or even an enemy. When a ship with this Exalt on board
            flies the colors of a particular person or group and comes
            into contact with other ships, the Exalt's ship temporarily
            appears to be the ship of the captain who flies those colors
            or a typical ship of that group. This is a visual illusion and
            even goes so far as to alter the perceived lines of the ship
            if necessary, so that a warship may appear to be a slaver's
            dhow or even a common fishing vessel. The Charm fails
            the moment that any outsider sets foot on the ship or if any
            damage (such as that of a flaming arrow or a barrel of pitch)
            is done to it. It has no mechanical effects in terms of sailing
            speed, defense or anything else.
