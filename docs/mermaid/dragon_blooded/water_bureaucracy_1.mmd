        Benevolent Master's Blessing<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote or 1 mote per two dice<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Bureaucracy: 2<br>
        Minimum Essence: 1<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        Using this Charm, a Dragon-Blood administrator can
        imbue his underlings with an echo of his own innate grasp of
        the workings of state. The bureaucrat may grant one trusted
        assistant a bonus of two dice per point of Essence spent. The
        assistant may not more than double her Bureaucracy, and the
        Exalt cannot donate more Ability than he has.<br>
        Alternately, for merely 1 mote of Essence, the Dynast may
        turn a group of dullards or even the soul-dead victims of the Fair
        Folk into passable temporary help by splitting his Bureaucracy
        Ability among them, giving a maximum of one point to each.
        This Charm requires some supervision — the assistants will
        have questions, and if they cannot find the Dragon- Blood to ask
        him their questions, the Charm fails. While supervising, the
        Dragon-Blooded technically has no Bureaucracy, and can do
        nothing but look after his charges. Temporary assistants must
        have originally possessed no dots in Bureaucracy.

        The Essence of bureaucracy is the same everywhere -
        the day-to-day affairs of a household or mercantile establishment
        tend to pool and eddy in predictable patterns no
        matter how grand or humble the scale. An Exalt may use this
        Charm to tap into the bureaucracy around her and under-
        stand its general nature and some specifics of its operation,
        such as where goods or documents are kept or who is
        responsible for what aspects of administration. This Charm
        does not grant unfettered access to guarded or locked areas,
        but it does allow the Dragon-Blood to use her Bureaucracy
        Ability in place of her Socialize Ability for purposes of
        dissembling about paperwork, permissions and passage.

        An administrator with this Charm can bend her entire
        bureaucratic apparatus to expedite a designated task: tax collec-
        tion, troop recruitment or selling merchandise, for example.
        Her followers perform their duties exceptionally well for the
        duration of the task, serving with the utmost dedication. At the
        completion of the task, the Dragon-Blood reaps additional
        benefits. Monetary profits increase by one percent per success
        on an Intelligence + Bureaucracy roll. If the end result is goods
        rather than coin, the amount is increased by two percent per
        success. Conscription and other recruitment are improved by
        two percent per success on a Charisma + Bureaucracy roll. The
        Storyteller is responsible for determining the base result of any
        such endeavor, before the improvements granted by this
        Charm. These improvements are strictly magical and do not
        actually improve the bureaucracy in the long term.

        This Charm is priceless to Dragon-Blooded who must
        travel but cannot bear to leave their affairs in the hands of
        others. Before leaving on a journey, a Dragon-Blood knowing
        this Charm may designate a proxy to make decisions on his
        behalf (most give a token of some kind, perhaps a seal, scroll
        or garment). The designee administers precisely as the Exalt
        would have were he present, making decisions and placing
        resources with her master's remarkable skill. Dusty legends
        popular only among scribes tell of assassinated Dynasts who
        reach out from beyond the grave to wreak havoc on the affairs
        of their murders by way of their faithful servants.<br>
        The Charm is effective for a number of weeks equal to
        the successes scored on a Perception + Bureaucracy roll, but
        the exact duration is not obvious to either the proxy or the
        Dragon-Blooded, who must simply trust in his abilities. The
        Dragon-Blood may end the Charm sooner if he wishes. If he
        does so, the committed Essence begins returning normally.

        There is an art to impeding the flow of a bureaucracy.
        The Thrashing Carp Serenade is only the beginning of that
        art. By means of this Charm, an Exalt may slow administrative
        tasks and productive deliberation in the area within the sound
        of his voice to a near standstill. In order to make any progress,
        the player of the opposing bureaucrat must best the wielder of
        this Charm's player in an opposed Stamina + Bureaucracy
        test. Any Water-aspected novice can hold a roomful of aged
        scribes at bay, but only the experienced or rash use this
        technique in an august body such as the Deliberative.

        Presenting an appropriate gift can take the edge off an
        uncomfortable social gathering or gain favors and access
        that would otherwise seem unattainable. Using this Charm,
        a Dragon-Blood intuits what would make the perfect gift, for
        public presentation, or the perfect bribe, for private dealings.
        Specifying gift or bribe, the Exalt's player rolls Perception
        + Bureaucracy. The Exalt must know the intended recipient;
        knowing him by reputation raises the difficulty of the
        roll by 2. This Charm does not provide the gift — or even
        easy access to it — it merely provides the information. The
        brutish administrators of the tributary lands may be fondest
        of gifts of wealth, but the nuanced tastes of the Dynasts may
        require that the would-be gift-giver acquire unusual items
        such as a lock of hair from a vain rival or a sapphire exactly
        the color of a favored mistress's eyes.

        The quickest path to disaster for a political gambit is to
        call a vote before knowing how the votes will fall. Armed
        with this Charm, a master bureaucrat can safely avoid that
        pitfall. With but a moment's consideration, the Exalt knows
        how many votes yea, nay or abstaining would result should
        the matter under discussion be called to a vote. It does not
        reveal by whom the votes would be cast. The Dragon-Blooded
        do not only use this Charm to pass their own
        agendas. They also hurry their rivals' plans to failure or
        simply judge where their vote will bring the highest price.
        Note that this Charm can only be used on groups of seven
        or more; it simply fails if used on a smaller group.
