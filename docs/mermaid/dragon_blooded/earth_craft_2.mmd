        The Terrestrial Exalted's basic and close connection
        with the things of the earth gives them great facility in
        manipulating the rude stuff that makes up the world. The
        most basic trick any Exalted craftswoman learns is that
        tools are, to a large extent, an illusion. It is the force of will
        that drives the act of creation, not the material items one
        uses to shape things.<br>
        This Charm bears that out. While the Charm is in
        effect, one of the character's hands may perform the
        function of any one normal tool. The character must
        decide what tool he wants to emulate when the Charm is
        activated. Whether it be a pick axe, hatchet or hammer,
        the Dragon-Blooded's bare hand fulfills the function quite
        nicely. The character takes no damage that a normal tool
        would not normally endure and can perform any normal
        function the tool is capable of - and can use her hand
        normally as well. The Exalt's hand does not take on the
        appearance of the tool in question.<br>
        The shaping hand only emulates the selected tool. If
        the character wants to switch functions, she has to activate
        the Charm again. Both hands can be enchanted separately
        using this Charm.

        This Charm is extremely popular with Earth-aspected
        Exalts because it forms the prerequisite for so many others.
        It enables the character to split stone with uncanny
        precision. Aside from its usefulness in siege — craft breach.
        ing walls and the like — the character can make all manner
        of useful items out of stone.<br>
        The character must spend at least a full minute care.
        fully striking at the stone. Most characters will use a hammer,
        pick of chisel, but a sword pommel or another rock will do
        just as well. Characters trained in martial arts might strikes
        with their bare hands. An the end of the minute the
        character strikes a final blow and the excess rock shatters,
        leaving behind the shape the character wanted.<br>
        Roll Wits + Craft. With a simple success, a character
        can quarry stone blocks ready for use in building or knock
        a doorway in a wall. With three successes, she can craft an
        obsidian vase, already hollowed out. With five successes,
        she can produce a portrait statue so realistic that a person
        might mistake it for the actual person, turned to stone.<br>
        The Essence cost of this Charm depends on the
        volume of the finished object: 1 mote of Essence per cubic
        foot of stone.

        The Dragon-Blooded of Earth include some superb
        mountaineers and rock-climbers, many as a result of this
        Charm. Not only may a character using this Charm cling
        to a rock face like a limpet, she leaves indentations in the
        rock that other people can use as hand- and footholds,
        making the climb easier for them. The Earth-aspected
        Exalt literally crafts a ladder out of a sheer rock surface as
        she climbs it.<br>
        The character can climb a sheer stone wall at a rate of
        10 feet per turn, 20 feet or more per turn up a rough cliff-face
        (or a surface where someone already made handholds
        in the rock). No Ability roll is needed. Those following the
        character up the cliff face are considered to have two
        automatic successes for any climbing check.<br>
        Surfaces that are worse than sheer, such as overhangs,
        call for multiple successes.

        By simply studying any crafted or created item, object
        or structure, a Dragon-Blooded using this Charm may
        determine that item's weakest point. This knowledge can
        be used to locate and eliminate flaws – or exploited to
        destroy the object.<br>
        To use this Charm, the character must study the
        object in question for at least a full minute. If the Exalt is
        able to handle or touch the thing being studied, the Charm
        costs only a single mote. Studying an object from a distance
        costs 3 motes.<br>
        Once the flaw has been determined, the character
        has two options. If the Dynast wants to try and eliminate
        the flaw, roll her Intelligence + Craft score and
        spend a point of Willpower. If the roll succeeds, the
        object is repaired - this Charm can effect the most
        serious repairs without tools, though something badly
        broken may have many flaws.<br>
        If the character wants to damage the thing in ques-
        tion, the Flaw-Finding Examination is much simpler. The
        next successful physical attack the character makes on the
        target does double normal damage. If the Exalt is targeting
        something such as armor or a weapon, treat it as doubling
        the extra successes of a disarming attempt. If the disarming
        attempt succeeds, the weapon or armor is destroyed.

        Charm of Lesser Unmaking<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 5 motes<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Craft: 5<br>
        Minimum Essence: 3<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Flaw-Finding Examination<br>
        <br>
        The Charm of Lesser Unmaking allows a Dynast to
        disassemble an object or structure without actually damaging
        any of its components. An item affected by this Charm
        is broken down into its component pieces.<br>
        For instance, if a Dragon-Blood was to use the
        Charm of Lesser Unmaking on a heavy wooden door
        bound in steel bands, the end result would be a stack of
        timbers, some hammered steel bands and a small pile of
        rivets. Items disassembled in this manner are rendered
        useless until put back together. Enchanted items are
        neutralized until reconstructed, but the Charm does not
        permanently disrupt such enchantments.<br>
        When the Charm of Lesser Unmaking is invoked, the
        character's player makes an Essence + Craft roll. The
        difficulty for this roll is 1 for simply constructed items
        (crudely made stone hatchets, huts lashed together with
        vines), 3 for sturdily or competently made items (a well-
        constructed sword, iron chains, the aforementioned door)
        and 5 for intricately or masterfully made items (a finely
        crafted piece of jewelry, a finely forged weapon). If the item
        in question is enchanted in any way, add i to the difficulty,
        meaning most enchanted items are difficulty 6 to disassemble.
        The maximum volume that a Dynast can affect.
        with the Charm of Lesser Unmaking is equal to her
        Essence in cubic yards.<br>
        Unmaking will hot work on any item that is made in
        one piece (i.e., a vase, stone carving or the like). However,
        it will undo knots and reduce chains to their component
        links. Lesser unmaking is a somewhat time-consuming
        process. The Exalt must also remain in contact with the
        item for a number of turns equal to the unmaking difficulty,
        and it cannot be done as a combat maneuver.

        Charm of Greater Unmaking<br>

        This Charm functions much like Lesser Unmaking
        but with much more dramatic effects. Rather than just
        being taken apart, an item affected by Greater Unmaking
        is actually reduced back to its raw materials. Sword blades
        melt into hunks of raw iron. Timbers turn to freshly cut
        logs. Glittering gemstones return to their uncut state. Fine
        pottery melts to clay.<br>
        When the Charm is used, roll the character's Essence
        + Craft. This roll is difficulty 1 for normal items constructed
        through standard methods, but difficulty 3 for
        exceptionally crafted or constructed things and 5 for items
        forged from the Five Magical Materials. The Exalt must
        also remain in contact with the item for a number of turns
        equal to the difficulty. The maximum volume that a
        Dynast can affect with the Charm of Greater Unmaking is
        equal to her Essence in cubic yards. This Charm is only
        effective against items made of materials in some way
        derived from the earth.<br>
        Items that are unmade are completely destroyed,
        reduced to their component materials. Whatever is un-
        made must be remade from scratch. The raw materials
        retain any inherent value, of course.

            Not every project can have a top-notch savant on
            hand to oversee it at every stage, and many of the most
            skilled savants are kept far too busy to personally
            attend to every detail of execution, even of the projects
            they do supervise. Through the use of this Charm, a
            savant may produce a detailed and comprehensive
            report and set of instructions that encapsulate the
            research and design phases of a project. This plan may
            then be given to the person or people actually performing
            the work, who will benefit from the expertise
            of the planning savant.<br>
            The character using Diligent Engineer Discipline,
            after familiarizing herself appropriately with the details
            of the proposed undertaking, pays for the
            activation of the Charm and takes the normal amount
            of time to prepare a plan, the player rolling her
            character's Intelligence + Craft at a difficulty of 2.
            Anyone faithfully working from this plan can avoid a
            total number of difficulty penalties during the under-
            taking equal to the number of successes rolled by the
            planning savant. In addition, he cannot fail to at least
            achieve at least minimal success on the finished project
            so long as no circumstances arise that would result in
            difficulty penalties greater than those the Charm's
            effects cancel.

            The Dragon-Blood stamps hard or smites the earth
            with his fist, and a shockwave of Essence and force
            ripples across the ground from the point of impact. This
            shockwave can crudely shape and pack one cubic yard of
            soil for every mote spent, but the continuous structure
            must have at least one edge within a yard of its creator.
            Ramparts of Obedient Earth can only shape soil, but it
            may affect mud, sand and even hard-packed dirt liberally
            strewn with pebbles. The Charm has no effect on solid
            rock of any density.<br>
            Dragon-Blooded chiefly use this Charm on the
            battlefield to quickly erect cover for themselves or others
            (using the standard rules for cover on pages 229-230 of
            Exalted), though creative applications can wreak havoc
            on a cavalry charge and disrupt formations of infantry.
            Anyone unfortunate enough to be standing on the
            ground when it buckles or collapses into a sinkhole
            suffers no damage unless an extremely deep excavation
            prompts an injurious fall, but such characters suffer
            immediate knockdown unless their players make a successful
            Dexterity + Athletics roll at standard difficulty.
            Outside of combat, this Charm has considerable utility
            for excavation work of all kinds, especially since the
            heavy compression of displaced earth allows for the
            creation of extremely stable tunnels. In general, walls of
            packed earth roughly a yard thick have a soak of 5L/8B
            and require 20 health levels to damage and 30 to destroy
            outright. These statistics will fluctuate wildly depending
            on a given structure's thickness and architectural stability.
            Characters may only use this Charm once per turn.

            The Dragon-Blood holds a Hearthstone in his hand
            and crushes the gem in his fist. Such is the power and
            exacting skill of this grip that the stone shatters. Use of
            this Charm requires a Wits + Craft (Jewelry) roll against
            a difficulty of the Hearthstone's rating + 2. A botch
            causes the stone to explode, inflicting dice of unsoakable
            aggravated damage to the Exalt equal to the difficulty of
            the Craft roll. If the character suffers two or more levels
            of damage from a botch, the explosion of Essence also
            costs him the hand holding the gem. On a failure, the
            Hearthstone remains undamaged. Success breaks the
            gem safely, releasing its store of Essence in a surge of
            power. If attuned to the Manse generating the Hearthstone,
            the Exalt regains a number of motes equal to the
            rating of the Hearthstone x 10. If this surge would bring
            his Essence pool above maximum, the excess motes
            bleed into his anima banner as if spent from his Peripheral pool.
            The act of shattering a Hearthstone with this
            Charm manifests as a deafening thunderclap and a flash
            of light brighter than the noonday sun.<br>
            This Charm is chiefly intended to break Hearthstones
            removed from settings. It cannot be used in
            combat or against Hearthstones still in their settings.
            Breaking a Hearthstone has negative effects on the
            geomancy of the Manse. Dragon-Blooded Dynasts
            who use this Charm to cannibalize family Hearthstones
            without an extremely good reason may not be
            permitted to reclaim the gems when they reform.
            Soldiers of Lookshy can expect even harsher sanctions
            from their superiors. Other outcastes may or may
            not suffer social ramifications for use of this Charm,
            depending on who owns the Manse generating the
            Hearthstone they destroyed.
