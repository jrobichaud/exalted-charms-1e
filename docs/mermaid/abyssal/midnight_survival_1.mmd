        Essence Engorgement Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: None
        Duration: Permanent
        Type: Special

        Prerequisite Charms: None
        Lacking ready sources of Essence apart from cannibal-
        ism, Abyssal Exalted must often conserve their power in
        Creation. Deathknights with this Charm can offset this
        weakness somewhat by bloating their animas with stolen
        power. For each time this Charm is taken, the Abyssal adds
        an additional 10 motes to his Peripheral Essence pool.
        However, the Exalt can only fill this extra capacity by
        consuming flesh or blood or by using Essence-draining
        magic. The character cannot recharge this bonus pool
        with Hearthstones, respiration or any other passive means.
        Characters cannot take this Charm more times than their
        permanent Essence rating.

        Once an Abyssal masters this Charm, he can subsist
        entirely on a diet of human blood. The character must drink
        a number of health levels per day equal to his permanent
        Essence if he wishes to replace his bodyâ€™s need for regular
        food. While subsisting on blood, characters suffer no dietary
        deficiencies. Many deathknights who learn this Charm find
        their palettes prefer the sweet taste of life to blander solid
        food. Note that blood consumed specifically as sustenance
        for this Charm does not provide Essence.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can intensify his aura of
        menace to ward off animals. Herbivores and domesticated
        beasts avoid the character completely and panic if directly
        confronted. Most non-magical predators keep their distance,
        fighting only as a last resort if cornered. This Charm
        has less effect on magical beasts and super-predators such
        as tyrant lizards and siaka. Such beings can overcome the
        aversion with a successful Willpower roll, although they
        still suffer a +1 difficulty to attack the Exalt.

        By beating an animal into submission or otherwise
        abusing it to establish dominance, an Abyssal with this
        Charm can mystically chain a beast to her will. The
        character gains one dot of the Familiar Background each
        time she uses this Charm, although she can only have one
        Familiar at a time. Thus, it would take three applications
        of this Charm to enslave a wild omen dog and another two
        to gain communication and sharing of senses. Although
        dangerous animals make superior slaves, it takes consider-
        ably more work to tame them. Beating an angry bear until
        it cowers in obedience can be problematic at best, to say
        nothing of subduing a full-grown tyrant lizard. Characters
        should prepare for appropriately epic combat unless they
        plan on raising such monsters from birth.

        While most deathknights can only absorb Essence
        from the blood and flesh of other sentient beings, a few
        have learned to draw power from lesser creatures. Once a
        character purchases this Charm, he can devour animals to
        regain Essence. Such prey must be consumed within minutes
        of death and cannot be cooked or otherwise prepared.
        Additionally, the animal must be a predator or scavenger.
        If these conditions are met, the Exalt regains 1 mote for
        every two health levels eaten. Otherwise, the meal affords
        only physical sustenance.

        With this Charm, a character gains unnatural resilience
        to hostile environments, regardless of attire or preparation.
        She can withstand brutal extremes of temperature without ill
        effect and need never fear hypothermia, frostbite, parasites,
        sand blindness or any other hazard of the wilderness. This
        resistance applies to virtually any condition a human body
        could actually survive, however briefly. Thus, a character
        could trudge naked through a blizzard without discomfort but
        would not have an easier time breathing underwater or
        surviving a raging bonfire. Ultimately, the limits of this
        Charm are left to Storyteller discretion.

        Pulling his arms and legs together like a corpse ready for
        burial, an Abyssal with this Charm can mystically sink into
        the earth. This process buries the character a full yard
        underground, leaving no trace of excavation on the surface.
        The character slips into a state of suspended animation for
        the duration of the Charm and does not breathe, although
        he still hungers normally. Sheltering Interment Prana lasts
        one hour for every 3 motes spent, unless the torpid character
        is injured or uncovered by digging. Once the Charm ends for
        whatever reason, the character arises to the surface in a
        shower of dirt and immediately regains consciousness. Characters
        may regain Essence while interred (assuming they are
        in a location that permits it), although motes used to power
        the Charm remain committed during its duration.

        By definition, few environments are as inhospitable
        and lifeless as the dim recesses of the Underworld. The
        food of ghosts is a poor substitute for the fruits of Creation,
        and the strange beasts that lurk in the realm of the dead
        afford little in the way of palatable meat. With this Charm,
        however, an Abyssal may readily consume spectral food
        and derive full nourishment from her meal.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can mentally unlock the
        twisting paths of a labyrinth to find a desired course or
        egress. The character may add his permanent Essence in
        automatic successes to a single attempt to navigate a maze
        or similarly convoluted network of passages. This Charm
        also aids in navigating the Labyrinth beneath the Under-
        world, although to a lesser degree. The Ebon Maze defies
        sane comprehension, both for its size and alien geometry.
        Characters can only unravel short stretches at a time, and
        this Charm only applies to a single navigation roll.

        With this Charm, an Abyssal can pursue a quarry with
        supernatural prowess and determination. The player can
        add one die per mote to any roll to track a single target
        individual. This target must be decided when the Charm
        is invoked and cannot later be changed. Bonus dice gained
        from this Charm apply to all tracking attempts until the
        character finds his quarry or gives up his hunt, although
        this Charm cannot more than double a characterâ€™s dice
        pool. Infallible Barghest Mien aids in tracking regardless of
        environment; the character can stalk his quarry through
        the twisting streets of a necropolis as readily as any wilder-
        ness. Characters may only benefit from one application of
        this Charm at a time. Characters using this Charm are
        considered supernatural trackers.

        For the duration of this Charm, the character passes as
        unobtrusively as a phantom. She leaves no footprints or
        scent or any sign of her passing that can be detected by
        conventional means. The character can also extend this
        protection to a maximum number of companions equal to
        her permanent Essence rating at a cost of 5 motes each.
        Only characters with supernatural tracking abilities can
        hope to follow an Exalt shrouded by this Charm, and such
        attempts are resolved through a normal tracking contest.
