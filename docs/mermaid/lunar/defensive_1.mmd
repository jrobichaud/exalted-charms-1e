        By means of this Charm, the Lunar focuses Essence
        into the skin of his hands and forearms, briefly
        causing them to become iron-hard. This allows the
        Lunar to parry hand-to-hand or ranged attacks, even
        if unarmed, though it confers no bonus to the parry
        and cannot be used as part of an offensive action.

        In clear terrain, up to five opponents can attack a
        single target in a turn. By using the Ground-Denying
        Defense to focus his instincts, a Lunar can use the
        terrain and the opponent's own actions to limit the
        number of attackers he faces in a given turn. For every
        2 motes spent, the Lunar can reduce the maximum
        number of opponents able to attack him in a turn by
        one. Essence spent to activate this Charm must be spent
        before initiative is rolled for the turn. The Lunar has no
        control over which opponent he avoids â€” those with
        the highest initiative scores are still able to attack,
        while those with lower initiative values are evaded -
        nor can he reduce the maximum number of opponents
        by more than his Dexterity or below one. The Ground-Denying
        Defense can be used in any terrain, even open
        ground. If the terrain naturally reduces the number of
        potential attackers, for example a narrow passage, the
        Ground-Denying Defense reduces the modified maxi-
        mum number of attackers for that terrain but still
        cannot reduce the value below one.<br>
        For Example: A Lunar with a Dexterity 3 could reduce
        the maximum number of opponents he faces by three at the
        cost of 6 motes. If he is facing five enemies, the two with the
        highest initiative totals could still attack him. If he was facing
        only three opponents, two would still be able to attack him â€”
        the Charm reduces the MAXIMUM number of attackers,
        not the actual number. In a narrow tunnel that allows a
        maximum of two attackers, a Lunar would only need to spend
        2 motes to reduce the number of attackers to one.

        The preternatural speed of a Lunar Exalted gives
        him a substantial advantage when seeking to parry an
        opponent's attacks. Indeed, a sufficiently dexterous
        Lunar can use the Golden Tiger block to render himself
        almost unassailable. When making a parry, he may
        spend 1 mote to convert a die into an automatic
        success. He may only purchase as many automatic
        successes as he has points of Dexterity in that pool. A
        Lunar using the Golden Tiger Block may parry lethal
        damage even if unarmed.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can attempt to parry an
        attack directed at him, even if he is unaware of it (for
        example, an attack from the rear or by an invisible
        character). The Exalt allows instinct to guide his
        actions and, thus, can respond to events that have yet
        to register in his conscious mind. The Lunar gains no
        advantage in the parry action, but he may use his full
        dice pool in the attempt if he has not yet acted during
        the turn. The Lunar may postpone his action, but once
        he has taken it, he may not use Wary Swallow Method

        Lunar may parry an attack with his full relevant
        Ability pool total (meaning Dexterity + Ability + any

        A Lunar may not move more than half his

        when seeking to avoid damage. By activating this Charm
        when the player declares a full dodge (see Exalted, p.
        231), the Lunar does not suffer any dice-pool penalties
        for dodging multiple attacks for the rest of the turn. She
        may use her full Dexterity + Dodge pool against all
        attacks for the remainder of the turn, providing she is

        he moves as gracefully as a swan and as sure-footedly as
        a mountain goat. Before making a dodge roll, the Lunar's
        player may spend Essence to transform some of his dice
        on a dodge attempt into automatic successes at a cost of
        I mote per die converted. The Lunar's player may purchase
        as many automatic successes as the character's
        Dexterity Attribute, even if circumstances - such as
        making multiple evasion attempts while using full dodge
        â€” reduce the total dodge dice pool. If modifiers reduce
        the number of dice in the dodge pool below the character's

        number of successes that may be purchased. The successes
        must be purchased separately for each dodge
        attempt, so a Lunar whose player sought to gain five
        automatic successes on each of three dodge attempts in
        the same turn would spend a total of 15 motes. A Lunar
        rendered immobile by terrain, magic or other effects
        gains no advantage from Bending Before the Storm and
        must rely on parry or soak to avoid the attack.

        Simply dodging an attack may not be enough to save
        an Exalt from harm â€” his opponent may have multiple
        actions and may keep attacking until the character's
        defenses fail. Using the Wind-Dancing Method, a Lunar
        can use his agility to both avoid an attack and make
        it much harder for an opponent to press her advantage.
        By using this Charm, when dodging, if he
        succeeds in dodging an attack, the Lunar can move
        up to eight yards from the opponent as a reflexive part
        of the dodge action, even if the Lunar has already
        moved this turn. In hand-to-hand combat, this means
        the opponent must herself move or use some reach-
        extending magic if she wishes to attack again. If the
        attacker cannot reach the Lunar for her next attack,
        she may make no further attacks against the Lunar
        this turn. A Lunar who is attacked repeatedly can
        activate this Charm after each attack and continue
        moving away from the attacker, hoping to exhaust
        her movement. Note that this Charm does not allow
        the Lunar to take a dodge action if he could not
        normally do so - Lunars wishing to defend themselves
        without splitting their dice pools or going full
        dodge will have to put this Charm in a Combo.

        By locking his eyes with his attacker and activating
        this Charm, the Lunar may distract his opponent
        and cause the attack to go wide. The attacker must be
        within a number of yards equal to (5 x the target's
        Perception) for the Charm to be effective - the
        opponent needs to be able to see the Lunar's eyes for
        them to distract him. If the attacker does no use her
        visual senses â€” for example, if she is blind or blind-folded
        â€” then the Charm is wasted. If the victim is
        deliberately avoiding the Lunar's gaze, this increases
        the difficulty of all actions involving the Lunar (including
        attack and defense rolls) by 2, and the
        avoidance must be declared before the Charm is
        activated. Once stung, the opponent may begin avoiding
        the Lunar's gaze, but the target cannot suddenly
        decide to begin when the Lunar activates this Charm.
        If the Charm takes effect, the attacker is momentarily
        confused as to the Lunar's position, and the
        Lunar may add a number of dice to his dodge pool
        equal to his Charisma. These are not Dexterity bonus
        dice, they are Charisma dice, and thus, they circumvent
        the normal ceiling on dodge bonus dice.

        Dodges usually require the defender to maneuver
        and are thus impossible if the character cannot give
        ground. Using the Unmoving Bear Defense, a Lunar
        Exalted can dodge attacks without moving, instead using
        his protean abilities to twist and deform his body to avoid
        the attacks. The Lunar must be conscious and able to
        maneuver to use this Charm, though he does not need to
        actually move his feet. When dodging, he may add his
        Essence to his dodge pool. If the character has no dodge
        action, he may use his Essence as his dice pool in a dodge
        attempt. This Charm is not compatible with other Charms
        that add dice to the character's dodge attempts but does

        <br>
        For a dodge to be effective, the character must be
        able to move away from the source of possible injury.
        Most attacks â€” a fist, a sword, an arrow â€” are concentrated
        on a single point and are, thus, avoidable, but not
        all attacks are. Some attacks are so magically enhanced
        they are unavoidable, while others affect an area, perhaps
        encompassing sufficient space that a character
        doesn't have the speed to get clear before the blow lands.
        In such cases, the character would ordinarily be unable
        to dodge avoid the attack. However, a Lunar who knows
        Flowing Body Evasion may attempt to cheat fate, using
        speed, agility and his shapeshifting nature to avoid harm.
        The exact method will vary â€” perhaps the Lunar puts on
        a burst of speed, dodges with godlike agility or squeezes
        into a tiny hole â€” but the end result is the same; a nearly
        perfect dodge. Properly used, this technique provides a
        nearly impenetrable defense.<br>
        When the Lunar activates this Charm, his player
        must make a reflexive Dexterity + Dodge roll. If the
        player gets at least one success, the Exalt avoids the
        attack totally. If the roll fails, the attack affects the Lunar
        normally. This is a dodge action, so a Lunar who fails to
        dodge with this Charm cannot attempt to make an
        &quot;actual&quot; dodge roll for the turn. This Charm cannot be
        placed in a Combo with any Charm that would cause the
        Lunar's player to automatically succeed on the Dexterity
        + Dodge roll. A Lunar can only use this Charm before he
        takes his action for the turn â€” he may postpone his
        action, but once he acts, he is unable to invoke Flowing
        Body Evasion.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can use his preternatural
        abilities to help defend his associates. If an ally is attacked,
        the Lunar may abort his action and seek to wrest
        the friend out of harm's way. The associate must be
        within a number of yards equal to the Lunar's Dexterity
        for him to be able to use the Charm, and the Lunar must
        pay the Essence cost as soon as his player declares the
        action. The Essence cost is usually 3 motes per attempt,
        but if the ally is bound to the Lunar by the Charm
        Brotherhood of Lake and River, the cost is only 2 motes.
        The Lunar's player makes a Dexterity + Dodge roll, and
        if the player rolls but a single success, the original target
        avoids taking damage from the attack. The Lunar takes
        the attack instead, with the dodge roll applied as a
        normal defense. If the roll botches, both the Lunar and
        the target take the attack, and neither can make any
        further defense against it. Lunars may use this Charm
        more than once in a turn, but it must be used before they
        take their action for the turn. The Lunar can postpone
        his action, but once he has made his dice action, he can
        no longer use this Charm. The shielded character cannot
        decline the effects of this Charm.

        Using a mix of Dexterity, shapeshifting and illusion to
        confuse his opponent, a Lunar can employ this Charm to
        mislead an opponent into attacking the wrong person. To
        use this Charm, the Lunar must be in close proximity to his
        intended target (who must be less than the Lunar's Dexterity
        in yards away). The Lunar spends the Essence to activate
        the Charm, then his player reflexively rolls the Exalt's
        Dexterity + Dodge. For the Charm to take effect, the
        Lunar's player must get as many successes as the attacker's
        Perception. If the Lunar succeeds, the Lunar avoids damage,
        and the new target is subject to the attack. The new
        target may attempt to parry or dodge as normal if she has
        actions available. If the redirection attempt fails, the Lunar
        takes damage normally â€” he sacrificed his dodge attempt in
        the redirection effort. This Charm cannot be used to avoid
        counterattacks, nor is it compatible with Charms that cause
        the Lunar to gain automatic dodge successes.

        Hide Toughening Essence<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 per 2 points<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        Using this Charm, a Lunar's skin thickens and
        strengthens, providing the Lunar with additional soak
        against bashing damage. When this Charm is invoked,
        or as a simple action at any time later in the
        scene, the Lunar's player may purchase bonus points of
        bashing soak for his character. A player cannot purchase
        more points of bashing soak than his character
        has dots of Stamina. The player must purchase at least
        one point when the Charm is activated. The Lunar's
        outward appearance is largely unchanged, though
        closer examination will show the modifications to his
        hide. The character can wear armor as normal while
        under the effects of this Charm. The Lunar's bashing
        soak cannot be raised above 12 by the combined
        effects of this Charm and Deadly Beastman
        Transformation's gifts and effects on the character's
        Stamina. Instead, the character may ignore bashing
        attacks that do less raw damage less than the difference
        between 12 and what the character's soak would
        be without the limit. A character may never ignore
        attacks doing more than 12 points of raw damage,
        regardless of what his soak should be.

        Armor-Forming Technique<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 mote per point<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Stamina: 3<br>
        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Hide-Toughening Essence<br>
        <br>
        The Armor-Forming Technique creates bony plates
        in the Exalt's body and limbs and hides vital organs
        behind multiple sheets of moonsilver-laced bone. These
        defenses allow the character to bolster his resistance to
        even lethal damage. The bone grows up and around the
        character's armor, sealing his weak points and reinforcing
        his armor's strength. Thus, this Charm is compatible
        with the use of armor. When this Charm is invoked or at
        any time thereafter during the scene, the player may
        spend motes of Essence to purchase extra soak against
        lethal damage for his character. The player must pur-
        chase at least one point when the Charm is activated.
        The maximum number of points of soak the player can
        purchase is equal to half (round down, minimum of 1) his
        character's Stamina Attribute.<br>
        Unlike the Hide-Toughening Essence, the changes
        wrought by the Armor-Forming Technique are pro-
        found and immediately obvious to any observers.
        Furthermore, each point purchased with the Charm
        reduces the Lunar's Appearance by 1 (to a minimum of
        0, at which point the character is hideous to behold).
        The Lunar's lethal soak cannot be raised above 12 by
        the combined effects of this Charm and Deadly
        Beastman Transformation's gifts and effects on the
        character's Stamina. Instead, the character may ignore
        bashing attacks that do less raw damage less than the
        difference between 12 and what the character's soak
        would be without the limit. A character may never
        ignore attacks doing more than 12 points of raw dam-
        age, regardless of what his soak should be.

        Using this Charm, the Lunar causes a large bony
        growth to appear on one of his arms (usually the off
        hand). He can use this &quot;shield&quot; to protect his body from
        hand-to-hand and ranged attacks alike, gaining the
        benefits of a target shield, automatically reducing attackers'
        success dice by one. The Lunar does not suffer
        a mobility penalty for using Limb-Shielding Growth,
        nor does it add to his fatigue value, but any attacks
        made using the hand upon which the shield has grown
        are at - 1 dice.

        Scales of the Dragon<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Prerequisite Charms: Armor-Forming Technique<br>
        <br>
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can transform his skin
        to resemble the hide of a ferocious Celestial dragon. His
        body is covered with a series of overlapping moonsilver-reinforced
        scales that glisten coldly in the light and
        provide formidable protection against all forms of attack.
        It is as if the character is swathed in articulated
        plate armor, and the Lunar gains a +9L/+9B soak
        bonus, while incurring only a - 1 mobility penalty. The
        armor has no fatigue value, and it is not counted as
        armor for the purposes of attacks that ignore armor, but
        it does count as armor for the purposes of stopping
        aggravated attacks.<br>
        Unlike the other armor-enhancing Charms known
        to the Lunar Exalted, Scales of the Dragon is not
        compatible with the use of armor. However, the Lunar's
        player continues to add his character's Stamina (or one
        half Stamina against lethal damage) to the character's
        soak. The Lunar still gains the benefits of a shield (if
        carried) and can reinforce his defense with Hide-
        Toughening Technique and Armor-Forming Style. No
        combination of this Charm, those two Charms or the
        effects of Deadly Beastman Transformation can increase
        either of the character's natural soaks above 12.
        If the character's soak would rise above 12, then the
        character will ignore attacks that have a raw damage
        less than the difference between 12 and what the
        Lunar's soak should be, to a maximum of 12.

        Invulnerable Moonsilver Carapace<br>

        By activating this Charm, the Lunar shields
        herself in a carapace of moonsilver, which appears to
        flow out of her pores to completely cover her body in
        shimmering plates. There are no gaps or weak points
        in this armor, which glistens fluidly as the Lunar
        moves. Though appearing to be liquid, the Invulnerable
        Moonsilver Carapace is nigh invulnerable to
        any form of attack. It adds 15B/15L to the Lunar's
        soak until the end of the turn. This soak stacks with
        armor and cannot be circumvented by any stratagem,
        Charm or sorcery (this is a perfect effect) and is not
        armor for the purposes of Charms that do not stack
        with armor. Its Essence cost is, however, crippling.
        During turns when the Invulnerable Moonsilver
        Carapace is activated, the Lunar suffers a -3 penalty
        to her Dexterity and Perception, though this cannot
        reduce the Attributes below 1.
