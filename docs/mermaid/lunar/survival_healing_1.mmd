        A Lunar's ties to the wild allow him to survive in
        conditions where others would suffer great hardship. By
        using this Charm, the Lunar taps into his bestial nature,
        using instinct and cunning rather than rational thought
        to guide his actions. When attempting any form of
        Survival roll that involves Wits, the Lunar's player may
        purchase additional dice up to his character's unmodified
        Wits score.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar replicates the breath
        control of a diving whale and need not breath for a
        considerable period of time (Stamina x 10 minutes). The
        Lunar can survive underwater, in poison gas or even
        where there's no air at all. However, the Lunar cannot
        speak without compromising the effects of the Charm â€”
        doing so requires him to expel air from his lungs. The
        Lunar may speak a few words, perhaps a short sentence,
        but if he does so, the duration of the Charm decreases to
        one minute. If he speaks a longer sentence or speaks
        again, the duration decreases to five turns. A third
        attempt at speech or any form of longer communication
        cancels the Charm. As part of activating the Charm, the
        Lunar must take a deep breath and so cannot simply
        reactivate it in hostile conditions.

        Charm to keep gills indefinitely.

        Lunar to Lunar â€” some may grow a layer of blubber,
        others a pelt of warm fur. Regardless, the effects are the
        same. For the duration of the Charm, the Lunar can exist
        in relative comfort even in the coldest conditions. He
        does not suffer from hypothermia, frostbite or immersion,
        nor does he suffer the effects of snow blindness.
        He is not, however, protected from the harshest
        rigors of the Elemental Poles, nor from magically
        conjured cold.

        This Charm has the opposite effect of Sealskin
        Endurance, resulting in a lean, sleek Lunar adapted to
        the rigors of warm environments. His body becomes
        highly efficient at conserving water and adept at

        For the duration of the Charm, the Lunar can exist in
        relative comfort in even the warmest conditions. He
        does not suffer heatstroke or sand blindness, nor does
        his skin blister and burn after exposure to the sun. The

        from the effects of fire.

        shelter for himself and a number of associates. The
        exact sort of shelter will depend on the environment
        â€” in rocky terrain, the Lunar's senses may lead him
        to a cave or cleft, while, in a forest, he may divine a
        hollow tree of suitable size. The Lunar's player makes
        a Perception + Survival roll, each success indicating
        capacity for one person, irrespective of the environmental
        conditions. However, this protection merely shields

        If he is traveling during the day in hospitable terrain,
        the Lunar is guaranteed to find enough nuts, berries,
        ants and fungi to keep him well fed. If he actively
        forages for food (see Exalted, p. 245), he may gather
        sufficient food to feed a number of people equal to his
        Perception + Survival, though doing so will take
        approximately an hour of his time. In harsher environments,
        the Lunar is still able to feed himself, though
        the Storyteller may wish the Lunar's player to roll his
        character's Perception + Survival, perhaps even at an
        increased difficulty level, to determine how many
        people he can feed. In no case should the difficulty
        increase above 3 unless the Lunar is stranded on pack

        moisture from around individual grains of sand, so sensitive
        are their tongues. If the Exalt seeks water for others,
        he may gather sufficient moisture to meet the needs of a
        number of people equal to his Perception + Survival,
        though harsh conditions may require his player to roll
        against a difficulty depending on the circumstances, each
        success indicating sufficient water for a person. Finding
        water takes 30 minutes per person (including the Lunar),
        and as with the Food-Scenting Method above, the difficulty
        of the roll to find water should never rise above 3.

        Many wild beasts can go for days without nourishment,
        and the Wolf Endurance Method allows the Lunar
        Exalted to do likewise. On a day that the Charm is active,
        the Lunar does not need to eat or drink and does not
        suffer any hunger pangs. Unfortunately, while Essence
        can support the body for a short while, it is very inefficient
        at powering the metabolism of an Exalted. As a
        result, the Wolf Endurance Method can be used for a
        number of weeks equal to the character's Stamina. After
        that point, the Lunar must temporarily loose a point of
        Strength or Stamina for each additional week. Attribute
        points lost in this manner cannot be recovered until the
        Charm is discontinued and the character has had several
        square and nutritious meals.

        By activating this Charm, the Lunar can place
        himself in a deep sleep, during which time he need not
        eat and drink. Instead, Essence and body fat reserves
        sustain the Lunar. The character may place himself in
        this hibernation for a number of months up to his
        Stamina score, paying 3 motes of Essence and 1 point of
        temporary Stamina to maintain his body during this
        time. However long he sleeps, the Lunar will be ravenous
        upon waking. The Lunar must have a solid meal within
        24 hours of waking, or else, he loses an additional point
        of Stamina each day until he does. The Wolf Endurance
        Method cannot offset this Stamina loss â€” after hibernating,
        the Lunar is beyond mere hunger. If his Stamina
        declines to 0, the Lunar dies. Every day after waking
        during which he eats properly allows the character to

        bashing damage per point of Stamina, at a cost of 1 mote
        of Essence per health level. The Lunar does not have to
        repair all of his bashing damage with this Charm - he
        may leave some to heal naturally. To an observer, bruises
        and other superficial injuries simply fade away to leave
        unblemished skin. Characters may activate this Charm
        even if unconscious.

        By exploiting his shapeshifting abilities, a Lunar
        Exalted is able to quickly deal with cuts and other
        wounds, causing the flesh around gashes to flow together
        and broken bones to magically reknit. The Exalt may
        spend 2 motes to transform a level of lethal damage into
        bashing damage. A Lunar cannot heal more lethal damage
        in a turn than he has points of Stamina. In addition,
        if even one health level is healed, any bleeding wounds
        automatically close, preventing the loss of further health
        levels. The Lunar does not have to repair all of his lethal
        damage with this Charm â€” he may leave some to heal
        naturally. Observers will see the blood flow cease, wounds
        knit together and swelling subside. All that remains are
        scratches and bruising. Wounds healed with this Charm
        do not scar. Characters may activate this Charm even if
        unconscious and dying of mortal injury but cannot
        activate it if they are actually dead.

        or breathing vapors into her face allows the Lunar to use
        his own Essence to fortify an ally's resistance to infection.
        The player may purchase dice up to his character's
        Stamina and add them to the subject's efforts to resist
        infection or disease or her player's rolls to overcome
        illness or disease.

        By infusing his hands with Essence and touching a
        subject's wounds, a Lunar is able to heal or alleviate those
        wounds. These healing hands can remove bashing damage
        and transform lethal wounds into bashing. Mother's
        Touch also closes bleeding wounds, preventing the loss
        of additional health levels. Each level of bashing damage
        healed costs 2 motes of Essence, while each level of lethal
        transformed costs 3 motes. Mother's Touch can be used
        to transform aggravated damage (into lethal), but each
        health level removed costs 3 motes and a temporary
        Willpower point. With each use of Mother's Touch, the
        Lunar may transform/cure as many levels of damage as he
        has points of Stamina.
