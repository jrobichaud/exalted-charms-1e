        Terrestrial Circle Sorcery<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        <br>
        Terrestrial sorcery is the simplest magic wielded by
        Lunars, and the No Moons will initiate members of any
        caste as sorcerers provided an Exalt shows the appropriate
        intelligence and aptitude. Note that invoking this
        Charm only enables the character to cast a single
        Terrestrial Circle Sorcery spell. The actual spell itself
        has an Essence cost, often very high, that the character
        must pay to actualize the spell. This cost is listed in the
        spell's description. Terrestrial Circle Sorcery can never
        be part of a Combo.

        Knowledge of this Charm allows a Lunar to tattoo a newly
        Exalted Lunar, fixing his caste and allowing him to resist the
        physical (but not mental) warping properties of the Wyld. The
        Lunar can fix the newly tattooed Exalt's caste as whichever he
        chooses, but the tests of initiation are used to determined the
        Lunar's caste. The experience points spent are gone forever.
        This Charm is generally practiced only by Lunars of the No
        Moon Caste, but other Lunars know it. However, it is considered
        inappropriate for Lunars of castes other than No Moon to
        tattoo young Lunars. The use of this Charm requires a ceremony
        of several hours, where occult instruments are used to
        draw the moonsilver tattoos into the Lunar's skin.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can engrave or otherwise mark
        an item so that it is immune to the chaotic effects of the Wyld,
        an untamed Demesne or another source of shapechanging.

        Though others may attempt to forge moonsilver,
        only a Lunar Exalted has the knowledge and spiritual
        connection to the Magical Material to shape it effectively.
        Enacting this Charm forges a bond between the
        Lunar and the moonsilver being worked. Moonsilver is
        essentially impossible to work without the use of this
        Charm, and the technique is a jealously guarded secret of
        the Lunars. This bond must be maintained â€” and the
        Essence committed â€” for the duration of the item-crafting
        effort, even when the object is not in the Lunar's
        immediate presence. Failing to maintain the Charm
        results in the immediate failure of the creation effort,
        though the moonsilver can be reused in a later project.
        The Essence cost of the Charm is twice the rating of the
        artifact the Lunar seeks to create. This is in addition to
        the basic Essence cost for creating the item (see Chapter
        Five of The Book of Three Circles for the specifics and
        rules of item creation).

        Celestial sorcery is much harder to learn and master
        than Terrestrial magics, and its practice among the
        Lunar Exalted is restricted to members of the No Moon
        Caste, who must undergo a rigorous (and often deadly)
        training regime before they are entrusted with its secrets.
        Note that invoking this Charm only enables the character
        to cast a single Celestial Circle Sorcery spell. The
        actual spell itself has an Essence cost, often very high,
        that the character must pay to actualize the spell. This
        cost is listed in the spell's description. Celestial Circle
        Sorcery can never be part of a Combo.
