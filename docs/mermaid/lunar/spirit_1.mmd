        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can &quot;see&quot; spirits in
        his immediate vicinity, gaining an approximate idea of
        their forms and actions. Provided he is circumspect, and
        no Charms aid the spirit, this observation is undetectable.
        Furthermore, this Charm allows the Lunar to sense
        the true form of a materialized spirit â€” a Lunar will know
        that a spirit masquerading as or possessing a human is not
        what it seems. The Charm does not allow the Lunar to

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can adapt his senses to
        detect the flows and patterns of Essence in the world
        around him, as well as any dematerialized spirits present.
        The Exalt can instinctively sense the direction and
        strength of flows, as well as the locations and power of
        loci such as Manses and Demesnes. Ascertaining more
        detailed information requires a Perception + Occult
        roll. A single success grants the Lunar basic information
        about the examined Essence, such as identifying
        the nature of a sorcery or the general geomancy of a
        region, while additional successes provide more indepth
        and specific information. For example, three
        successes might allow the Lunar to judge the age and
        other specific details of the sorcery, while, with five
        successes, he may identify the sorcerer by &quot;signature&quot;
        traits. Likewise, three successes provides the sort of
        detailed survey information necessary to construct a
        Manse, while five allows a near-perfect comprehension
        of an area's geomancy.

        Devil-Restraining Grip<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Using the Devil-Restraining Grip Charm, a Lunar
        can immobilize a spirit with a snare of Essence,
        binding it to her as if on a leash. If the spirit is
        dematerialized, she can drive it into the material
        world, and once the spirit is in physical form, it is
        prevented from dematerializing. To use this Charm,
        the Exalt's player makes a Manipulation + Occult roll
        against a difficulty equal to the spirit's Essence. The
        spirit must be within (the Lunar's Essence x 10) yards.
        If she succeeds, the spirit cannot move further from
        the Exalt than its Essence Trait in yards and must
        materialize. If it does not have the Essence to materialize,
        then the additional Essence required is drained
        from the Lunar's reserves. If both the spirit and the
        Lunar cannot pay for the spirit's materialization, then
        the Essence is wasted, and the spirit remains immaterial.
        If the spirit is already further away than its Essence
        in yards, it may only move toward the Lunar. The
        Charm does not protect the Lunar from the spirit's
        actions, though each success beyond that needed to
        ensnare the spirit imposes a -1 die penalty to all of the
        spirit's actions. The spirit is held for a number of
        minutes equal to the Lunar's Essence.

        If an encounter with a spirit goes wrong or if the
        being is intrinsically hostile, then the Lunar may have
        to fight it, a difficult proposition against a possibly
        incorporeal foe. The Spirit-Maiming Essence Attack
        is one of the Lunar's most potent weapons in such a
        conflict, allowing him to use his strength of will to
        bolster his material attacks. The Lunar must activate
        this Charm before he attacks. If the attack is successful,
        the damage caused by the attack is aggravated. In
        addition, the Lunar's player also reflexively rolls a
        number of dice equal to the Lunar's Manipulation +
        Essence and adds a bonus to the base damage of the
        attack equal to the number of successes rolled. Spirits
        destroyed with this Charm are gone forever, and they
        can sense Exalts who know it and threat them with the
        same wary respect reserved for those who can slay gods.
        Attacks enhanced with this Charm may explicitly be
        part of Combos with Charms of other Attributes.
