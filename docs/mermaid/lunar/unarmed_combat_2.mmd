        Lunars revel in the visceral nature of hand-to-hand
        combat, particularly when they can feel the breath of
        their opponents on their face. As a consequence, grap-
        pling is a favored technique. This Charm allows the
        Lunar to fortify his musculature, allowing his player to
        purchase additional dice up to the character's Dexterity
        when rolling a single wrestling attack with Martial Arts
        or Brawl. The Charm allows the addition of dice to
        enact, continue or escape from such maneuvers or to do
        extra points of damage in a clinch attack.

        The pinnacle of their wrestling abilities, the Spine-Breaking
        Technique demonstrates the awesome power
        of the Lunars' bestial nature. By means of this Charm,
        the Lunar turns a painful and often incapacitating
        attack into a lethal demonstration of his prowess. The
        Lunar makes a clinch attack as normal, but rather than
        the normal bashing damage, the Spine-Breaking Technique
        inflicts lethal damage. The Spine-Breaking
        Technique is also very difficult for the victim to escape
        from, and the player of a Lunar who activated the
        technique with his last action adds the Lunar's Strength
        in automatic successes to the roll to resist any escape
        attempt. A Lunar caught in a clinch may activate this
        Charm on his action to do lethal damage. The Spine-Breaking
        Technique can be used in a Combo with
        Charms that increase the character's Strength but not
        with any that enhance Dexterity.

        This Charm allows the Lunar to imbue his muscles
        with Essence, giving flesh and bone the strength and
        consistency of steel hawsers. When the character has
        successfully executed a clinch, tackle or throw or is doing
        damage from maintaining a clinch, this Charm allows
        the Lunar to transform dice up to his Strength into
        automatic damage successes. However, the maximum
        number of dice the Lunar can transform is equal to his
        Essence or Strength, whichever is lower. The Essence for
        this Charm is spent after soak is applied, so characters
        need not worry about wagering Essence. The Mighty
        Bear Crush can be used against any target the Lunar
        perceives, including dematerialized spirits.

        Lunars revel in close combat, and many are unafraid
        to place themselves in a disadvantageous position if
        doing so will aid their hunting companions. Indeed,
        doing so is seen by many as both a test of strength and
        courage. The Throat-Baring Hold is one of the most
        powerful expressions of this, allowing a Lunar who has
        his opponent in a hold to &quot;open&quot; the opponent's defenses
        to other attackers.<br>
        The Lunar must make a successful hold attack.
        Any extra successes reduce the target's lethal and
        bashing soak totals until the Lunar's next action or
        until the opponent breaks free. As with normal hold
        attacks, the Lunar's attack does not inflict damage. The
        Throat-Baring Hold may be maintained for multiple
        turns, but the Lunar must spend 5 motes and his action
        (and Charm) for the turn in order to maintain the
        Charm, and the target may break out, just as if it were
        a normal hold.<br>
        The penalty inflicted remains the same from turn
        to turn, until the hold is broken â€” a Lunar whose
        initial attack fares poorly must release his foe and apply
        the hold again to get a new result. In all turns after the
        initial attack, the Lunar's player may add the Exalt's
        Strength as automatic successes to the roll for the
        purposes of combating the target's escape attempts and
        reducing soak totals. Attacks against the target will
        not harm the Lunar - the Charm helps keep him clear
        of the incoming strikes - but a botched attack may
        still strike him.

        Despite their formidable strength and unparalleled
        martial prowess, a foe is sometimes able to resist
        the Lunar's attentions for a protracted period. Activating
        the Hyena Jaw Technique allows a Lunar who has
        his opponent in a clinch or hold to subdue the foe
        quickly. The Charm, usable only in beastman form,
        allows the Lunar to extend his neck and muzzle, allowing
        him to clamp his jaws on the opponent's throat.
        Every turn the Charm is in effect, the target loses a dot
        of temporary Stamina and falls unconscious if reduced
        to 0 Stamina. If the target attempts to break away from
        the clinch or hold, she must soak lethal damage equal
        to the Lunar's Strength + 2, irrespective of the success
        (or otherwise) of her player's escape roll. If the target
        falls unconscious as a result of Stamina loss or her
        injuries, further damage inflicted by the Hyena Jaw
        Technique reduces one of the target's Mental Attributes
        (Perception, Intelligence or Wits) by one, but
        not below 0. If all four targeted Attributes are reduced
        to 0, the target dies. A victim of Hyena Jaw Technique
        regains one Attribute dot per day.

        Though reveling in close combat, there are times
        Lunars seek to escape the clutches of their opponents
        and brute strength is not enough. This Charm, which
        can only be used when in the hybrid beastman form,
        allows the Lunar to give his foe a deadly surprise. After
        activating the Charm, the Lunar sprouts a number of 6-inch
        long, razor-sharp spines. Anyone who is clinching
        the Lunar when the spines form or who thereafter
        clinches, holds or otherwise engages in wrestling with
        the Lunar, risks grave injury. Those clinching or holding
        the Lunar suffer damage equal to the Lunar's Strength +
        5L, and the Lunar substitutes this for his normal damage
        when he does damage in a clinch.<br>
        Any unarmed attacks made by the Lunar while the
        spines are extended inflict lethal damage rather than
        bashing. Players of characters who make unarmed
        attacks against a Lunar using the Cunning Porcupine
        Defense must make a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics
        roll (Difficulty 3) or else their characters suffer lethal
        damage equal to their own Strength. Regardless, the
        Lunar takes damage from the opponent's attack as
        normal. The Cunning Porcupine Defense remains in
        effect as long as the Lunar commits Essence to the
        Charm and stays in beastman form. If the Lunar leaves
        hybrid form or stops committing Essence, the spines
        merge back into his body.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can tear a fragment from
        her bones and reform her muscles to launch it from her
        body, hurling it at an opponent within a range of (her
        Perception x 10) in yards. This attack is horrible to
        behold, as the shard tears free of the Lunar's body in a
        shower of blood and torn tissue, which, like the bone,
        regenerates near-instantly. The attack is made with
        Dexterity + Archery or Thrown, at - 1 accuracy, and it
        inflicts (9L + extra successes) damage.

        Rather than simply wounding an opponent, a Lunar
        may use her strength and body mass to overbear the
        opponent and force him into a disadvantageous position.
        Using the Angry Rhino Charge after making a successful
        Brawl or Martial Arts attack allows the Lunar's player to
        purchase extra dice of damage up to the Exalt's Strength
        Attribute. These bonus dice do not add to the damage
        inflicted by the attack, but they do count toward deter-
        mining knockdown and/or knockback (see Exalted, pp.
        234-235) and also determine the difficulty of the target's
        roll to avoid knockdown.<br>
        For Example: Ma-Ha-Suchi, in beastman form, uses
        the Angry Rhino Charge in his battle with the Terrestrial
        Gavus. After Ma-Ha-Suchi successfully strikes the Dragon-
        Blooded, 3 motes are spent to purchase six extra dice to
        supplement the ancient Lunar's natural Strength. Gavus has
        a combined Stamina + Resistance of 8, which Ma-Ha-
        Suchi's damage dice exceed. Gavus' player must therefore get
        five successes (the number of dice purchased by Ma-Ha-Suchi),
        or the Dragon-Blood suffers knockdown.

        The Lunars can grow not only tentacles, but also
        other enhancements as well. Through the use of this
        Charm, the Lunar reshapes his head to be like that of a
        bull, including the bull's deadly horns, for the instant of
        an attack. Using the Bull Head Technique, a Lunar who
        is charging into combat (that is, who moves his full
        movement allowance for the turn) may focus his Essence
        to maximize damage to his opponent. After the Lunar
        makes a successful Brawl or Martial Arts attack, his
        player can purchase additional damage dice up to the
        value of the Exalt's Strength Attribute. All damage from

        Though Lunars enjoy the thrill of combat, they
        don't always want to kill their foes. In many cases, they
        seek simply to subdue them, as part of a ritual or demonstrative
        duel or to claim a ransom from the defeated foe.
        This Charm envelopes the Lunar's limbs in Essence,
        lending his blows considerable weight but also cushioning
        the target from the worst effects of the blow. When
        rolling damage for an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack, the Lunar's player can transform a number of dice
        up to a maximum of his character's Essence into automatic
        successes at the cost of 1 mote per die. Attacks
        enhanced with Subduing the Honored Foe automatically do bashing damage only.<br>
        This Charm's effects take place immediately after
        soak is applied, but the player must pick before he makes
        the attack roll how many motes to spend converting dice
        of damage into automatic successes. If the player pays to
        convert more damage dice than he rolls, the extra
        Essence invested is wasted. If the target remains conscious
        after the attack but suffered more levels of bashing
        damage than her Stamina, she is dazed, and her player
        must make a successful reflexive Willpower roll (difficulty
        of the Lunar's Strength) or have her character
        spend her next action shaking off the attack's effects.

        Some Lunars employ finesse in combat, but most
        prefer brute force, and the Body Breaking Kata reflects
        this fact. It is not a subtle attack, but instead, employs a
        combination of size, strength and outright aggression to
        overwhelm an opponent. The Charm is only effective if
        the Lunar charges into close combat with her opponent
        - she must move half her movement allowance before
        engaging the foe. The Lunar channels Essence through
        her body while making a single unarmed Martial Arts or
        Brawl attack. This Essence charge seems to cause the
        Lunar's form to swell and take on giant proportions for an
        instant. As far as observers are concerned, the target is
        charged by a monstrous version of the Lunar's totem.
        The player of the attacking Lunar should roll Dexterity
        + Brawl or Martial Arts as normal for the attack but
        double the number of extra successes before applying the
        target's soak. All damage from the Body Breaking Kata is
        lethal.

        Maintaining the initiative in combat is often as
        important as the amount of damage inflicted on the
        opponent. Keeping control of the direction of a fight
        often takes precedence over inflicting injuries in the
        short term. The Foot-Confusing Buffet allows the Lunar
        to keep an opponent off balance, sacrificing one or more
        damage dice from a successful Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack in favor of an initiative penalty for the foe in the
        following turn. The Charm surrounds the Lunar's attacking
        limbs with a nimbus of light, creating a
        mesmerizing series of patterns that distract the foe. The
        Lunar must activate the Charm before making his attack,
        paying the basic Essence cost even if the attack
        misses. Only if the attacking Lunar gets at least one extra
        success does the Foot-Confusing Buffet come into play.
        The Lunar may sacrifice a number of dice of damage up
        to his Essence or Strength score, whichever is lowest.
        Damage dice are sacrificed before soak is applied. The
        number of points sacrificed is applied as a penalty to the
        target's player's initiative roll in the next turn.

        the Lunar focuses his strength and aggression into
        the blow, as well as Essence. Every mote expended adds
        one die of damage to a single attack by the Lunar against
        an item. If the item is man-made, then each mote spent
        is worth two automatic damage successes instead. The

        Strength is only part of winning a fight. Knowing
        where to hit the opponent to gain maximum effect is an
        equally important consideration â€” perhaps more important
        in the case of fast, agile Lunars. Using this Charm,
        the Lunar guides a single unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        blow to the enemy's weak point, circumventing his
        armor and defenses. For every 2 motes spent, the Lunar
        may reduce the soak rating of her opponent's armor by 1.
        This applies to armor soak only â€” the target's natural
        soak is unaffected. The attack cannot reduce the soak of
        an opponent's armor by more than the Lunar's own
        Dexterity or below O. The soak reduction applies only for
        the enhanced single attack. This Charm is of instant
        duration â€” if the Lunar makes multiple attacks in a turn
        and desires to reduce the opponent's armor soak each
        time, she must pay for each reduction separately.

        the mightiest Exalts. By means of this Charm, a Lunar
        can reduce the efficacy of his opponent's armor, directing
        his attacks at the protective layers rather than
        directly at the opponent. To do so, he transforms his
        claws into vicious, hooked rending devices, lacking the
        length to cause serious harm to the opponent but grant-
        ing them sufficient strength and resilience to rend even
        the hardest armors.<br>
        The Lunar makes an unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts
        attack as normal, including determining the amount of
        raw damage before soak. The opponent may reduce the
        attack's damage only using his armor's lethal soak rating,
        not his Stamina or any enhancements, unless they specifically
        reinforce the armor. Unlike a normal soak, this
        may reduce the damage of the attack to O. Roll any
        remaining damage dice normally, and subtract the number
        of successes from all of the armor's soak ratings. This
        reduction is a permanent one, reflecting the Lunar's
        efforts to shred and rend the armor, though a skilled
        armorer may be able to affect repairs. If the number of
        successful damage dice exceeds the armor's soak rating,
        the armor is destroyed (irreparably), with the excess
        applied to the opponent (who may soak with her Stamina)
        as health levels of lethal damage. The Armor-Rending
        Claw Fist is not effective against armor made from the
        Five Magical Materials.
