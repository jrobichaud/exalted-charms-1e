        When purchasing this Charm, the Lunar chooses an
        animal no larger than an elk and no smaller than a large
        cat. That animal is now the Lunar's spirit animal, and its
        shape is now considered one of the Lunar's true shapes.
        It is thus easier to spot the Lunar's Tell when she assumes
        this animal shape, and if the Lunar becomes locked into
        her true shapes, she can still use this Charm to change
        between her human and totem animal shape.<br>
        Almost all Lunars know this Charm. A Lunar either
        tastes the heart's blood of his totem animal during his
        initiation or, in many cases, finds the totem-shape when
        she Exalts. Such Exalts are driven by an incredible
        craving to consume the life of a beast of their newfound
        shape, so that they can fairly gain its form. If a Lunar
        wants a totem animal larger than an elk or smaller than
        a cat, she may gain one, but she must already know or
        must immediately purchase Humble Mouse Shape or
        Towering Beast Form as appropriate and cannot exceed
        the limits of those Charms.<br>
        A Lunar may change his totem animal, but doing so
        is both costly and dangerous. Those who choose to do so
        must pay a dot of permanent Willpower and buy this
        Charm again. Traces of his previous form remain in the
        Lunar's Tell, to which may be added attributes of the new
        form. A Lunar whose Tell combines the traits of several
        animals is known by other Lunars as a chimera and is
        regarded with scorn. In addition, the Lunar may offend
        the animal avatar of the species he forsakes and, thus,
        gain the enmity of that godly being and the species it
        protects. A Lunar in his totem animal shape may spend
        1 mote to activate this Charm and return to human
        shape. This Charm may be activated only once per turn.<br>
        Members of the Eclipse Caste may not learn this
        Charm, for it draws on a natural power of the Lunar
        Exalted that Solars cannot master or emulate.

        This Charm allows the Lunar to make minor
        cosmetic changes to the appearance of any of his true
        forms. Such modifications include changing hair, eye
        or skin color by several shades, lengthening (or shortening)
        hair length, reshaping a chin or nose slightly or
        straightening teeth. A modification only applies to
        the form in which it was used â€” if the Lunar wishes to
        alter is hair color in his human and totem-animal
        shapes, he will have to use this Charm twice. Shaping
        the Ideal Form does not allow the Lunar to assume the
        appearance of another being, though it may help to
        disguise his appearance. Lunars who wish to assume
        the form of specific individuals must learn the Charm
        Prey's Skin Disguise. Shaping the Ideal Form cannot
        be used to conceal the Lunar's Tell or tattoos. No
        matter how much effort is put into the shaping, the
        Charm cannot be used to improve the Lunar's Physical
        Attributes unless the player invests experience in
        raising the Attribute â€” in that case, training time can
        represent an extended campaign of cosmetic self-
        improvement by reshaping. Overuse of the Charm
        tends to detract from the Lunar's appearance, render-
        ing him bland. It is regarded as a sign of degeneracy and
        vanity among Luna's Beloved.

        Deadly Beastman Transformation<br>

        Duration: Instant<br>
        Type: Reflexive<br>

        Prerequisite Charms: Finding the Spirit's Shape<br>
        <br>
        This powerful Charm allows the Lunar to shift its
        shape into a monstrous hybrid of the human form and its
        totem animal. This shape is three feet taller than the
        Lunar's normal height and enjoys many bonuses. Anyone
        who sees the Lunar in this shape cannot fail to
        mistake him for what he is â€” a sleek and deadly feral
        killing machine. A character using this shapechanging
        Charm is considered to be in one of his true forms, which
        includes the increased visibility of his Tell.<br>
        The first time a character takes this Charm, he
        receives five Attribute points and two gifts. Both Attribute
        points and gifts must be applied immediately after
        the character purchases this Charm. Subsequent purchases
        of the Charm provide three Attribute points and
        one gift per purchase. A character can purchase this
        Charm no more times than he has points of Essence.<br>
        Each Attribute point represents the war-shape's
        enhanced physical capabilities. One Attribute point
        raises the character's Strength or Stamina by 1 while he
        is in his beastman form, and two Attribute points can
        raise the character's beastman form's Dexterity by 1.
        Once allocated, these bonuses are fixed and cannot be
        modified. These points must be allocated immediately
        when the Charm is purchased - characters cannot save
        up points between purchases of this Charm. When the
        character is in his hybrid war-shape, these bonus Attributes
        are considered to be a natural part of the
        character's Attribute for the purposes of Charms that
        double Attributes and for the purposes of Charms that
        allow the character to convert Attribute dice to auto-
        matic successes on a roll.<br>
        Gifts represent special capabilities the hybrid shape
        offers and give the character some sort of special bonus
        beyond increased Attributes. Gifts often have prerequisite
        gifts, which their effects build on and enhance. A
        character cannot take a gift without taking all of its
        prerequisites. Characters cannot take a gift more than
        once unless the gift specifically permits it. Gifts, like
        the Attribute bonuses, apply only while in hybrid form.
        If the Lunar wishes to take advantage of his gifts in
        human or totem animal form, he must learn Charms
        that have similar effects or else use the Charm Calling
        Luna's Favor.<br>
        In beastman form, weapons and armor worn by the
        Lunar in human form are present in hybrid form as well,
        magically adjusted to suit the size of the hybrid form.
        While the Lunar's adjusted Attributes might allow him
        to wield huge weapons or bear the weight of superheavy
        armor, this Charm does not turn the Lunar's accoutrements
        into such gear. Though the weapons may change
        somewhat in size and shape to accommodate the hybrid's
        large grip, the weapons' and armor's statistics do not
        alter. Defensive gifts (Rugged Hide, Impenetrable Beast-Armor)
        combine with any armor worn by the Lunar.<br>
        Characters can gain large dice pools by means of
        the Deadly Beastman Transformation. Keep in mind
        that the Lunar's running speed, jumping distance and
        lifting ability will likewise change. Players should remember
        that they may use the automatic successes rules
        (Exalted, p. 90-91) rather than rolling dice for many
        Athletics feats.<br>
        Characters in their hybrid shape may spend 5
        motes activate this Charm and assume human form.
        This Charm can be used only once per turn. Because
        assuming totem animal shape with Finding the Spirit's
        Shape requires only 1 mote of Essence and the Lunar
        can then change to human shape with another activation
        of that Charm, it is significantly cheaper for a
        Lunar to pass through animal shape when returning to
        human form (2 motes versus 5). However, this takes an
        extra turn, so Lunars in a hurry sometimes directly
        return to human shape.<br>
        Members of the Eclipse Caste may not learn this
        Charm, for it draws on a natural power of the Lunar
        Exalted that Solars cannot master or emulate.

        Mouse Shape, Many-Faced Moon Transformation
        This Charm allows the Lunar to assume the outward
        appearance of a specific other human. To do so, the
        Lunar must consume the target's heart's blood like any
        other beast whose form she wishes to gain. The Charm
        then allows her to assume the victim's outward appearance
        and Physical Attributes and Appearance, but she
        does not gain the victim's knowledge, Mental or Social
        Attributes or Abilities. If the target is an Exalt, the Lunar
        gains his outward appearance but remains a Lunar. This
        Charm cannot be used to mimic the Fair Folk who,
        though humanoid, are something other.<br>
        The character can still dress and act any way she
        desires â€” she adopts the victim's outward appearance,
        not personality. A Lunar willing to consume many mor-
        tals can develop quite a diverse catalog of shapes. Just as
        with any other type of shapechanging, the appearance of
        the character's Tell and tattoos is unchanged. Lunars who
        wish to masquerade as the persons they consumed would
        thus be well-advised to use Charms to suppress these
        unmistakable signs. The Charm's effect includes a gender
        change if appropriate, with the same limitations to preg-
        nant characters as Many-Faced Moon Transformation.<br>
        Members of the Eclipse Caste may not learn this

        By allowing a subject to taste his blood and activating
        this Charm, the Lunar can make minor
        alterations to the form of another willing subject. The
        range of possible changes are as per Shaping the Ideal
        Form - this Charm cannot be used to change a
        target's shape or to give her the appearance of a specific
        other human. Unlike modifications the Lunar makes
        to himself, the changes fade after a day. The subject
        must also spend a temporary Willpower point (two if
        she is an Exalt). Unwilling subjects, tattooed Lunars,
        non-humans, the undead and unmaterialized spirits
        cannot be shaped by this Charm. Once the Charm is
        activated, the player rolls Manipulation + Craft
        (Body Shaping) at standard difficulty. One
        success or more indicates success, while if
        the roll fails, the subject's form is unaltered.
        A botch, however, results in an unexpected
        â€” and usually unpleasant - outcome.

        &quot;library.&quot; This process is a difficult one, both
        painful for the subject and requiring immense skill
        by the Lunar, but it allows the subject to attain a non-human
        form or to masquerade as another human. In
        addition to the costs to the Lunar, the subject must
        spend 2 temporary Willpower points (3 if an Exalt).
        Unwilling subjects, tattooed Lunars, non-humans, the

        <br>
        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can reshape inert
        once-living material into another form. He can turn a
        fallen tree into a shelter, a bone into a weapon or a hide
        into clothing. He cannot, however, use the Charm to
        create complex objects (a simple buckle is about as
        sophisticated as it gets), nor can it be used to reshape
        objects that are already under the influence of Charms,
        sorcery or other supernatural effects. The item to be
        shaped must be smeared in the Lunar's blood, costing
        him a single health level (unsoakable lethal damage)
        before Essence can be channeled into the object.<br>
        The texture, appearance and so on of the original
        material remains unaltered â€” a bone weapon is clearly
        bone, not metal â€” but the product may be modified by
        conventional methods (dyes, paint and so forth). The
        Essence cost for activating the Charm reflects the amount
        of raw material affected. If the target object is roughly the
        same size as the raw material, the Essence cost of the
        Charm is unaltered. If a size change is part of the process,
        the Lunar must spend additional Essence motes, each
        extra mote allowing the final product's size to be twice
        (or half) that of the raw material. An object fashioned in
        this manner are not permanent, but rather remains while
        the Lunar commits the Essence. If the Lunar uses the
        Essence for other purposes, the object reverts to its
        original form. A Lunar can, however, make his construct
        permanent by spending a point of Willpower, but this
        may only be done at the moment of creation. In this case,
        the Charm is instant, and the Essence returns normally.<br>
        Shaping the object requires a Manipulation + Craft
        roll, usually of difficulty 1. The Storyteller may, however,
        increase this difficulty for more complex shapes.
        This Charm cannot effect the undead.

        unimpeded at twice his normal movement rate. If the
        Lunar is in a form with innate swimming abilities, such
        as that of a shark or a seal, the Fish Tail Technique
        confers no additional benefits. This Charm does not
        confer the ability to breath water, and the character must
        surface to breathe (per the holding breath rules on p. 243
        of Exalted) or risk drowning.

        Most Lunars abhor the trappings of civilization, but
        this does not mean that they don't occasionally require
        tools. Unlike mortals, who must keep a range of prefabricated
        tools for such circumstances, a Lunar can reshape
        his body to provide the necessary instruments. Hands
        are strengthened and fingers and claws sharpened and
        reshaped to provide any tool the Exalt might need.
        While using the Tool-Hand Technique, the Lunar can
        naturally perform tasks that would normally require
        tools (for example, boring a hole in wood, hammering a
        peg or picking at stone). The Lunar's hands, feet or
        whatever else is shaped into the tool takes on a superficial
        resemblance to the tool in question but remains
        indisputably flesh and bone (albeit flesh and bone
        surrounded by a nimbus of Essence). A Lunar with
        multiple limbs can equip the multiple limbs at a cost of
        1 mote per limb and suffers no injury from the pounding.
        cutting or rasping of using the &quot;tools.&quot; The Tool-Hand
        Technique cannot be used to form weapons or to otherwise
        give the Lunar an advantage in inflicting or
        withstanding damage, nor does the Lunar work any
        faster than she would with normal tools. Any rolls
        involving Craft gain +2 dice when the Lunar uses this
        Charm.

        By means of this Charm, the Lunar's bones, muscles
        and organs become capable of immense deformation, allowing
        him to squeeze his body through gaps it would not
        normally fit through. By means of this Charm, a human-sized
        Lunar could wriggle through a hole as small as a mouse
        hole or a knothole in a fence. The process is very unsettling
        to watch and is likewise uncomfortable for the Lunar.<br>
        The Rat-Head Technique cannot be used as part of
        any Combo or while the Lunar is under the effects of a
        Charm or sorcery that hardens or reinforces his limbs in
        any manner (such as the Body Weapon Technique). While
        using this Charm, the Lunar's natural soak cannot exceed
        2B/2L under any circumstances, and he cannot parry lethal
        attacks without an appropriate stunt â€” his &quot;softened&quot; body
        lacks the strength to do so effectively. A Lunar under the
        effect of Rat-Head Technique may dodge normally.

            to focus Essence into their limbs, increasing their strength

            her skin. The Exalt's player makes a Strength + Athletics

            That character cannot more than double her initial

            By performing a series of limbering up exercises and
            stances as he directs Essence through his muscles, a
            Lunar Exalt can temporarily boost his hand-eye coordination,

            In addition to using his Essence to fortify his body,

            likeness of the legs of a giant cat, and his whole body
            twists slightly, becoming lower and more streamlined.
            For the remainder of the scene, the character can move
            at twice his normal movement rate and leap three times
            his normal jumping distance. If the target surface is
            uncertain, the Lunar's player must still make a (Dexterity
            or Wits) + Athletics roll normally for the character to
            land successfully (see p. 252 of Exalted) after such a leap.
            A Lunar may carry a &quot;passenger&quot; on such a leap, though

            By creating a flap of skin between his arms and legs,
            a Lunar can drastically extend his leaping abilities.
            Using the skin flap as crude gliding wings, a Lunar using
            this technique can extend his horizontal leaping abilities
            in excess of 10 times his normal leaping distance, though
            this depends on his trading height for distance. He can
            travel 20 yards per dot of Strength and Athletics, and
            another two yards for every yard of altitude he descends.
            For example, a Lunar with Strength 3, Athletics 3 who
            leaps from a branch 100 yards up may glide to a point on
            the ground 320 yards away ([3 x 20] + [3 x 20] + [2 Ã— 100]
            yards). The Lunar may attempt to extend this distance
            by rolling Dexterity + Athletics, each success adding 10
            percent to the range. The anima powers of a Full Moon
            Lunar, the effect of Panther Stride Stance and other
            movement-enhancing Charms do not add to the gliding
            distance of the Skin-Flap Flying Method.
