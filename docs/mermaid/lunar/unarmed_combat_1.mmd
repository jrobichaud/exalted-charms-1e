        A Lunar may use this Charm to enhance his unarmed-combat
        abilities, making his blows more deadly
        by focusing Essence into his limbs. Rather than inflicting
        bashing damage when executing a single unarmed Brawl
        or Martial Arts attack (not a wrestling maneuver), his
        blow causes lethal damage.

        The Lunar uses the Sinuous Striking Grace Charm
        to guide his actions, allowing Essence flows to suggest the
        likely actions of allies and enemies alike. When rolling
        initiative, the Lunar may spend motes of Essence to
        improve his initiative rating, 1 mote buying a +1 modifier
        to a maximum of the Lunar's Dexterity score.

        By utilizing the sinuous movements of a snake, the
        Lunar can use a civilized enemy's strengths against him.
        When attacked by a Melee or Martial Arts attack but
        before damage is rolled, the Exalt's player can make a
        reflexive Dexterity + Dodge roll against a difficulty equal
        to the number of successes rolled on the attack. If the roll
        succeeds, any damage from the attack is applied to the
        attacker instead of the Lunar, with extra successes by the
        Lunar increasing the number of damage dice. Even if the
        Exalt fails to reflect the attack, Lunar's successes on the
        Dexterity + Dodge roll still reduce the attack's successes
        normally. The Snake Body Technique is a form of dodge
        and cannot be used against undodgeable attacks, nor can
        it be used to avoid counterattack-type effects.

        By holding his body in anticipation of the opponent's
        actions, a Lunar using this Charm can ready a devastating
        blow against his foe, timing that blow with deadly
        precision. The Lunar activates the Charm before rolling
        initiative and chooses a self-inflicted initiative penalty.
        For every point of penalty on the initiative roll, the
        Lunar gains a bonus die to his attack roll. This bonus
        cannot exceed the Lunar's Dexterity, counts against the
        Exalted's Dexterity Charm dice and only applies during
        turns when the character plans to make Brawl or Martial
        Arts attacks. If the Lunar does not attack in the turn in
        which the Charm is activated, the advantages of the
        Coiled Cobra Stance are lost. If the Lunar full dodges or
        aborts to a parry, the effects of the Charm are lost. Coiled
        Cobra Stance cannot be used in a Combo with Charms
        that grant extra actions. A character cannot split his dice
        pool in a turn when he uses the Coiled Cobra Stance.<br>
        For Example: After the first turn of combat, Kajeha
        Lef knows she is faster than her opponent does and opts
        to use the Coiled Cobra Stance. Kajeha is in hybrid form
        and has a Dexterity of 6 but opts to delay her initiative
        by only 5 points rather than risk the opponent acting
        first. In the second turn of combat, her initiative score is
        14 (reduced to 9), while her opponent gets a 7 total.
        Kajeha still acts first, but her use of the Coiled Cobra
        Stance adds 5 dice to her attack pool.

        This Charm allows the Lunar to harness his bestial
        prowess to become a killing machine. He becomes instinctively
        aware of an opponent's weak spots and how to
        exploit them, allowing him to target his attacks to
        maximum effect. He may spend Essence to turn his
        Dexterity dice into automatic successes when making a
        single unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack. The dice
        converted into automatic successes are not rolled as part
        of his dice pool but the remaining dice (including Ability
        dice and any Attribute dice not converted to successes)
        are rolled normally. Each Attribute die converted costs
        2 motes of Essence. The precision of the Deadly Claw
        Blow allows the Lunar to harm beings not wholly in the
        material world, allowing him to target spirits even if they
        are dematerialized.<br>
        For Example: Swims in Shadows uses Deadly Claw
        Blow to enhance his abilities in combat with the Fair Folk. His
        player spends 6 motes of Swims in Shadows' Essence to
        convert his 3 Dexterity dice into automatic successes, then
        rolls the four dice of his Brawl Ability to see if he can increase
        this number. He rolls 3, 4, 8 and 1, adding one additional
        success, for a total of four successes.

        improving his combat abilities. When using the Charm,
        the Lunar may make unarmed claw attacks with his Brawl
        or Martial Arts at Spd +6, Acc +1, Dmg +3L, Pry +1. He
        may make unarmed bite attacks with those Abilities at
        Spd +0, Acc + 2, Dmg +5L, Pry +0. Claws of the Silver
        Moon can harm spirits even if they are dematerialized
        and Charms that enhance moonsilver weapons may be
        used in conjunction with Claws of the Silver Moon.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar channels Essence
        into his digestive system, momentarily transforming
        his stomach acids into a lethal weapon. He can spit
        this corrosive phlegm at a target within 10 yards. The
        attack uses Dexterity + Thrown or Athletics with a -
        1 accuracy modifier. The opponent may dodge but
        not parry. The attack inflicts 8L + extra successes.
        The Burning Saliva Attack continues to harm the
        opponent each turn until it is washed off or otherwise
        removed. Scraping the acid off requires a Dexterity +
        Athletics roll and is not a reflexive action - the
        victim or one of his associates must use a dice action
        to do so, though she need not roll.<br>
        Rather than directly attacking an enemy with
        his acid saliva, the Lunar can target the opponent's
        weapon. The accuracy of such attacks is -2, and
        rather than the opponent soaking the damage, her
        weapon must do so. Its soak is equal to its damage
        value (so a straight sword that inflicts +3L has a soak
        of 3). Roll unsoaked damage dice normally, and every
        two successes reduce the weapon's damage value by
        one. If the weapon's damage reaches 0, the weapon is
        rendered useless. The acid continues to harm the
        weapon until it is removed, which requires a non-reflexive
        Dexterity + Athletics action, though the player of
        the character removing the acid need not actually roll.
        Such an attack doesn't affect weapons made of the Five
        Magical Materials.

        A sufficiently skilled Lunar can adjust the lethality
        of his acid saliva, adjusting its damage and efficacy to
        meet specific requirements. One such alternative is to
        reduce the damage of the attack in favor of more precise
        targeting of the attack. A Lunar may attack as per the
        Burning Saliva Attack (range 10 yards, accuracy - 1,
        damage 8L + extra successes, opponent may not parry),
        and if the attack is successful, his player rolls damage
        normally. However, as well as inflicting health levels of
        damage, such an attack can reduces of the target's
        Physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity and Stamina),
        his Appearance or his Perception. After rolling for
        damage, the Lunar may sacrifice a health level of
        damage to reduce one of the target's Physical Attributes,
        his Appearance or his Perception by one dot.
        An Attribute cannot be reduced below 1 with this
        Charm. An Exalt requires a week of healing to recover
        each Attribute point lost, but such injuries are permanent
        if inflicted on mortals.

        The Soporific Venom Attack functions as per the
        Burning Saliva Attack, attacking at - 1 accuracy at a
        range of 10 yards. However, the damage it inflicts is
        14B + extra successes. The target may be rendered
        insensate in two ways: He may sustain sufficient bashing
        damage to render him incapacitated, or the toxin
        may shock him into unconsciousness. The latter may
        happen if the number of bashing health levels inflicted
        by a single attack after damage is rolled exceeds
        the target's Stamina Attribute. If it does, the target's
        player must make a reflexive Stamina + Endurance
        roll against a difficulty equal to the Lunar's Essence. If
        the defender succeeds, he simply takes the bashing
        damage from the attack. Otherwise, he is immediately

        The Deadly Viper Strike allows the Lunar to create
        and use a more toxic variant of the venom in the Adder
        Fang Method. This Charm must be used as part of an
        unarmed Brawl or Martial Arts attack. In addition to
        the normal attack damage, the venom injected into the
        target causes injury and pain, though the immediate
        damage is less than for the Adder Fang Method toxin.
        Instead, if the Lunar's attack was successful and does
        damage, the victim's player must roll Stamina + Endurance
        against a difficulty equal to the Lunar's Essence. If
        the roll fails, the target suffers an automatic level of
        lethal damage, and his player must roll again (at the
        same difficulty) next turn. Success indicates that the
        target sustains no injury, and any additional successes
        reduce the difficulty of resisting next turn. If the difficulty
        is reduced to 0, the poison is no longer effective.
        A botch indicates that the target suffers two automatic
        levels of lethal damage, and the difficulty of resisting
        next turn increases by one.

        Fists, fangs and talons are only the most obvious
        components of a Lunar's arsenal. Using the Rabid Beast
        Bite, a Lunar Exalt can focus tainted traces of Essence
        into an injury, no matter how insignificant. Any wounds
        caused by a Brawl or Martial Arts attack supplemented
        by Rabid Beast Bite are likely to become infected, even
        if the attack inflicted only bashing damage.<br>
        Players must make a roll for their characters to
        avoid infection on any injury caused by such an
        attack. Wounds that would normally have a chance of
        infection (those inflicting lethal or aggravated damage)
        increase the difficulty of the roll to avoid infection
        by the Lunar's Essence, and rolls for the unExalted to
        recover from the infection are also increased by the
        Lunar's Essence. The difficulty of avoiding infection
        from bashing damage is 1. The cost of this Charm must
        be paid before the Lunar makes his attack roll. Using
        the Rabid Beast Bite on another Lunar is considered
        a sign of great disrespect.

        a shapeless mass.<br>
        The Form-Destroying Touch must be activated
        before the Lunar makes an unarmed Brawl or Martial
        Arts attack. The Charm has no effect unless the Exalt
        gets at least one success on his attack roll â€” if the attack
        roll fails or if the target blocks or dodges the attack, the
        Charm has no effect, and the motes and Willpower are
        lost. However, if the attack lands, the Lunar's player
        rolls damage dice as normal â€” which the target cannot
        soak - though no actual damage is recorded on the
        target's health levels. Instead, if the successes inflicted
        by the attack equal or exceed the target's Stamina, the
        Lunar has implanted part of his protean power in the
        victim, with potentially devastating consequences. If
        the phantom damage does not exceed the victim's
        Stamina, the Charm dissipates with no lasting effect.<br>
        The target of a successful Form-Destroying Touch
        suffers no ill effects for the first day after she has been
        attacked, though the corrupt Essence is already at
        work. Each day after the first, anomalies begin to
        emerge, and the target must attempt to resist the
        corruption (roll Stamina + Endurance against a difficulty
        equal to the Lunar's Essence). If the roll succeeds,
        she resists ill effects for that day. If the roll fails, she
        suffers aggravated damage; the first time this happens,
        the damage is a single die, but it increases to two dice
        the second time the roll fails, three the third, and so
        forth, as the contagion continues to spread its mutations
        and damage. These damage dice are rolled
        normally. If the number of contagion-inflicted aggravated
        health levels of damage exceeds the victim's
        Essence + Stamina, the victim's body looses cohesion,
        and she dies, transmuted into a chaotic jumble of
        mutated organs and protoplasmic sludge.<br>
        Form-Destroying Touch cannot be used on those
        immune to shapeshifting (such as Lunars) or where a
        Charm or sorcery prevents the Lunar from touching his
        victim or shields the target from Wyld mutation. Mortal
        medicine is powerless to cure the Form-Destroying Touch,
        though Charms such as Bodily Regeneration Prana can
        negate the effect of Form-Destroying Touch if they cure
        all the aggravated damage from the character's health
        track. Disease-curing Charms and magical remedies do
        nothing unless they are of incredible power (the legendary
        Panacea Pipe might cure an afflicted character, for
        example). The notable exception is the cure-all Sweet
        Cordial (see Exalted, p. 336, which allows the victim's
        player a regular Stamina + Resistance roll at difficulty 1
        to defeat the infection.

        <br>
        Using this Charm, a Lunar can fashion part of his
        body â€” usually the hair or a tail â€” into the form of a
        venomous snake or snakes. If doesn't matter if the Lunar
        has one large snake or many smaller ones, the effect is the
        same. These snake-buds act pseudo-independently of
        the Lunar. Though limited in reach to half the Lunar's
        Essence in yards (rounded down), the snakes can attack
        independently of the character. The snake or snakes
        attack targets of the Exalt's player's choosing and act on
        the Lunar's initiative. The snake-extensions fight with
        half (round down, minimum 1) the Lunar's Attribute
        and Ability scores and do Strength + 1L base damage.
        They act once per turn but can split their dice pool
        normally. Though lacking the raw strength of the Exalt,
        a serpent's bite is venomous, acting in the same manner
        as the Deadly Viper Strike (see above). However, the
        venom is less than the Lunar's own, and the victim's
        player need only roll Stamina + Endurance against a
        difficulty equal to half the Lunar's Essence (rounded
        down, minimum 1).<br>
        A snake may be attacked independently of the
        Lunar and has 3 health levels: -1, -2 and -4. A fourth
        point of damage &quot;kills&quot; or disables the snake. These
        wounds do not affect the Lunar while the snake remains
        in existence, but if he chooses to discontinue the
        Charm, half (round up) of any wounds suffered by the
        character's ophidian offshoots transfer to the Exalt.
        Damaged snakes heal at the same rate as an Exalt (not
        as fast as the Lunar using the Charm); dead snakes do
        not heal. While a snake remains &quot;alive,&quot; a Lunar Exalted
        cannot be subjected to an unanticipated attack by
        a visible foe. The snakes cannot parry or dodge, but a
        Lunar whose snake-extensions are attacked can parry or
        dodge the attack as if it was against the Lunar himself.
        A Lunar cannot use this Charm more than once at a
        time on himself.

        <br>
        Ordinarily, a Lunar can only attack targets within
        arm's reach. The Monkey Arm Style allows the Lunar to surprise
        his opponents by extending his reach by a number of yards equal to his
        Essence. The Charm causes one or both of the Lunar's
        arms to elongate, reshaping bone and muscle to create a
        long, sinuous limb that, despite its snake-like appearance,
        remains fully functional. The hand can grasp objects or targets
        but lacks the finesse required to wield a weapon
        effectively. The Monkey Arm Style can be used on its own to
        extend the Lunar's reach for an instant, but it is most commonly
        used as part of a Brawl or Martial Arts attack, allowing
        the character to make unarmed attacks or wrestling
        maneuvers at a distance equal to his Essence in yards.

        <br>
        This Charm allows the Lunar to pour Essence into one
        of his limbs, which splits into
        multiple, writhing tentacles. Anything held in that
        limb is dropped, and while the Exalted's natural weaponry
        functions as normal, the damage is always converted
        to bashing before it is applied to the target. Each of the
        tentacles is capable of making a separate attack at the
        Lunar's full Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts dice,
        although all must attack the same target within a
        number of yards equal to twice the Lunar's Essence. If
        the defender dodges, make one roll and apply it to all
        attacks. However, parry attempts must be made against
        each attack. The tentacles re-form into the original
        limb after the attacks are made. The Exalted cannot
        create more tentacles than his permanent Essence.

        make clinch, hold and throw attacks out to a number of
        yards equal to twice his Essence (per the rules on pages
        239 and 240 of Exalted). If the Lunar's player botches his
        attack roll or if the target gets five more successes than
        the Lunar in any contest related to the wrestling, the
        Lunar's player must make a reflexive Wits + Athletics
        roll or have his character thrown toward the target and
        suffer the effects of knockdown.

        Prerequisite Charms: Startling Tentacle Attack<br>
        <br>
        By increasing the amount of Essence he commits
        when creating tentacles, the Lunar can strike at targets
        further away, allowing him to make hand-to-hand at-
        tacks at incredible range. The Lunar can make a number
        of tentacle attacks up to his permanent Essence, and
        each tentacle may make a separate attack at the Lunar's
        full Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts. A tentacle does
        damage as if it were a normal unarmed attack by the
        Lunar. Each tentacle may attack the same target, or they
        may attack different victims, but each defender must be
        in sight and within a number of yards of the Lunar equal
        to (the Lunar's Essence x 10). Roll each attack sepa-
        rately, but if the target parries or dodges the attack, make
        one roll and apply it to all attacks directed against him.
        As a result, the Lunar's opponent may avoid some none,
        some or all of the tentacles. The tentacles re-form into
        the original limb immediately after the attacks are made.
        The cost of the Charm is 4 motes per tentacle if all are
        directed at a single target, or 5 motes per tentacle if the
        attacks are targeted at multiple foes.

        <br>
        By directing his pseudopodia at an opponent's
        weapon, the Lunar can use the multiplicity of the
        tentacles and their speed and reach to foil the
        opponent's attacks. The maximum number and reach
        of the tentacles is as per the Tentacle-Spear Strike
        (Essence x 10 in yards, no more than Essence tentacles),
        but rather than rolling Dexterity + Brawl, the
        Lunar's player rolls Strength + Brawl, adding 1 die for
        each tentacle formed. The opponent may seek to parry
        or dodge the attack, but if the number of successes
        remaining after defense still exceeds the target's Dexterity,
        she is disarmed. Weapon-Snatching Coils do
        not inflict damage on the target, and the attack cannot
        be split between multiple foes.
