        Stealthy Fox Method<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 2 motes per die<br>
        Duration: One scene<br>
        Type: Simple<br>

        Minimum Essence: 2<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: None<br>
        <br>
        Using this Charm. a Lunar can call on his feral instincts
        to enhance any attempts to hide or use stealth. By
        honing both his senses and his agility, the Lunar exploits all
        cover to the maximum possible extent, avoiding obstacles
        that might alert others to his presence, and moves in such
        a graceful manner as to avoid catching the attention of
        unwary observers. For the rest of the scene, when making a
        roll to move stealthily or to hide, the Lunar's player may add
        as many dice to the character's Stealth pool as the Exalt has
        dots of Dexterity, at a cost of 2 motes per die.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can mimic the skin of the
        chameleon and becomes able to adjust the texture and color
        of his hide to better aid in concealment. The player may
        convert the character's Dexterity into automatic successes.
        For the rest of the scene, as long as the character stays still, he
        may convert a number of dice up to his Dexterity Attribute
        into automatic successes. The character must spend 2 motes
        of Essence when the Charm is activated per dot of Dexterity
        the player wants to convert. If the character moves any
        distance, the Lunar must reflexively spend 2 motes at the end
        of the movement to adapt the camouflage to his new back-
        ground. The Charm's benefits are negated until the character
        pays these 2 motes. The Chameleon Skin Method provides
        the Lunar with no advantage if he is clothed or armored.

        Object-Concealing Method<br>
        <br>
        Cost: 3 motes<br>
        Duration: One day<br>
        Type: Simple<br>
        Minimum Wits: 3<br>
        Minimum Essence: 3<br>
        Prerequisite Charms: Chameleon Skin Disguise<br>
        <br>
        The Object-Concealing Method allows a Lunar
        both to find a suitable place of concealment for an item
        and to enhance its protections against even a deliberate
        search. The Lunar's player rolls Wits + Survival, usually
        against a difficulty of 1 but perhaps higher in terrain with
        very few hiding places. If she succeeds, the Lunar has
        found a place of concealment for the item within (her
        Wits x 10) yards. Furthermore, the number of successes
        are the difficulty of Perception + Investigation rolls of
        others trying to find the object in a deliberate search.
        The object cannot be discovered by accident. It takes
        (10 - the Lunar's Essence) turns to find a hiding place for
        the concealed item.

        Ally-Concealing Method<br>

        <br>
        This Charm functions as per the Object-Concealing
        Method save that the object being hidden is another
        character. The concealing Charm remains active so
        long as the affected character remains calm and relatively
        still. Attacking will disrupt this camouflage. A
        Lunar may conceal as many people at once as his
        Essence Trait, each costing 5 motes. A Lunar cannot
        use Ally Concealing Method to hide himself. It takes
        (10 - the Lunar's Essence) turns to find hiding places for
        the concealed individuals.

        Lunars are crafty in the ways of the wild, adept at
        following â€” or hiding â€” signs of passage. There are
        times, however, when a Lunar wishes to truly disappear,
        throwing even the craftiest pursuers off the
        scent. Traceless Passage Technique allows him to do
        so, concealing evidence of his passage and disguising
        anywhere he rested. Trackers without magical enhancements
        are unable to follow his trail while the
        Charm is active, and those with Charms or sorcery to
        aid their endeavors suffer a difficulty modifier equal to
        the Lunar's Essence. Traceless Passage Technique
        does not provide the automatic successes against
        other Lunars.

        Using this Charm, the Lunar can extend the benefits
        of Traceless Passage Technique to his companions,
        and his instincts help to guide their actions as well as
        his own. Enacting the Charm costs 4 motes, and each
        person encompassed in Track-Sweeping Essence costs
        an additional 2 motes. If the Lunar wants to conceal his
        own passage, he must pay for himself as well. The Lunar
        may conceal the passage of as many people as he has
        points of Essence.
