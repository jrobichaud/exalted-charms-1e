        Using this Charm, the Lunar can heighten all of his
        senses far beyond those of normal humans. His ears grow
        to better hear sound, his nostrils flare to enhance his
        ability to smell, and his eyes grow and dilate to enhance
        his sight â€” he can even taste individual ingredients in a
        meal and feel the slightest wind on his skin. For the
        duration of the Charm, the Lunar's player adds bonus
        dice equal to the amount of Essence spent to Perception
        rolls. He may not increase the character's pool by more
        dice through this Charm than the Lunar has dots of
        Perception. This enhancement, though powered by Essence,
        does not grant the Lunar supernatural powers â€”
        it merely enhances his mortal senses.

        This Charm is actually three different Charms,
        one each for sight, for scent and taste and for hearing
        and touch. Through it, the Lunar can hone his senses
        far beyond those of most animals. When making a
        Perception test with the heightened sense, the Lunar's
        Perception dice are automatically successes, and the
        Lunar's player need only roll the character's Ability
        dice (usually Awareness or Survival). Charms that
        reduce successes in Perception tests affect these automatic
        successes normally. The Charm must be purchased
        separately for each of the three sense groups
        and only provides a bonus when used in conjunction
        with that sense group. A Lunar may use a maximum of
        two Heightened (Sense) Charms at any time. If he
        wishes to enhance a third, he must cease using the
        Charm on one of the already-heightened senses.
        Heightened (Sense) Method Charms may not be used
        at the same time as the Sense-Sharpening Change or
        any other Charm that boosts the Lunar's Perception,
        though they may be used in conjunction with sense-
        enhancing Charms that do not directly enhance the
        Perception Trait, such as Night Is Day.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can attach his perceptions
        to the senses of another human or an animal. The
        Lunar must touch the target when activating the Charm,
        but once it is functioning, the subject may travel up to
        a mile from the Lunar per point of the Exalt's permanent
        Essence and still serve as a source of sensory
        information. If the subject is willing, no roll is required
        to activate the Charm. Otherwise, the Lunar's player
        must make a Wits + Awareness roll, with a difficulty
        equal to the target's Essence. Animals of the Lunar's
        totem species are automatically willing, while other
        animals are not unless charmed or befriended. To
        succeed, the Lunar's player must roll a number of
        successes equal to or exceeding the target's Essence.
        Otherwise, the Charm fails, and if the target is an Exalt
        or other supernatural creature, he knows the Lunar
        attempted to use a Charm on him. Mortals and mortal
        beasts cannot detect the Charm.<br>
        While the Charm is active, the Lunar senses
        everything his subject does. For all intents and pur-
        poses, the subject becomes the Lunar's eyes and ears.
        The Lunar has some semblance of his own senses, but
        borrowed senses dominate his perceptions. Any ac-
        tions taken by the Lunar while the Sense-Borrowing
        Method is being used â€” including reflexive actions â€”
        are at +2 difficulty. As a consequence, most Lunars
        simply meditate while using the Charm. If the either
        the Lunar or his subject sustain an injury (at least one
        health level of damage), the Charm ends. This Charm
        gives the Lunar no control over the creature, he
        simply shares its senses.

        Lunars are very aware of their environments and,
        thus, very difficult to ambush. When the character is
        attacked from surprise, the Lunar may choose to activate
        this Charm automatically if the character has sufficient
        Essence to power it. When it does activate, the Lunar's
        player's reflexive Perception + Awareness roll to avoid
        being ambushed (see Exalted, p. 238) gains a number of
        bonus dice equal to the Lunar's Perception.

        This reflexive Charm allows a Lunar to know if he is
        being watched, either by normal senses or magic. It activates
        automatically if the Lunar comes under sustained
        observation â€” a casual glance or a flirtatious look are not
        enough to trigger it. The Charm guides his perceptions to
        gather further information, allowing a reflexive Perception
        + Awareness roll. The number of successes determines
        the information gathered. A single success merely confirms
        that the Lunar is being observed, while additional
        successes will pinpoint the number and direction of observers
        (one per success). A Lunar observed by magical
        means will know the viewpoint from which he is being
        watched but not the actual location of the observer.

        Lunars with this Charm can track and predict the
        weather, using Essence to build on and extend their
        natural perceptions. The number of successes from a
        Wits + Survival roll determines the scope of information
        a Lunar can divine. Each success garners him either
        knowledge of conditions within a 10-mile radius or for
        the next day (cumulative). A Lunar may purchase information
        on both area and time, but he must do so in as
        even a manner as possible. For example, a Lunar who gets
        4 successes cannot purchase information on a 40-mile
        radius or about a 10-mile radius for 4 days in advance, but
        rather learns about a 20-mile radius for two days in
        advance. If there are an odd number of successes, the
        Lunar's player may choose which aspect has the additional
        die. The Weather-Scenting Method may not be
        used to predict future conditions under the influence of
        magic, though it may be used to gather information on
        the prevailing conditions when the Charm is activated.

        After activating this Charm, the Lunar instinctively
        knows the direction of the Imperial Mountain.
        This works irrespective of the Lunar's situation â€” it is as
        effective inside a building or underground as it is in
        plains or forest â€” and works as well in darkness as in
        daylight. If the Lunar simply desires to know the direction
        of the Imperial Mountain, no roll is required
        However, he may also use this Charm to identify his
        location, though this requires a Wits + Awareness roll,
        the number of successes indicating the precision of the
        information. One success gives him little more than
        what he already knows, three successes allows him to
        narrow his location down to the county or district, and
        five or more let him know precisely where he stands.

        not attuned to a Lunar. The Lunar's player must make

        moonsilver deposits and unattuned items in the region.
        One success allows the Lunar to ascertain whether there
        is any moonsilver within a number of miles equal to the
        Lunar's Perception + Essence. Three successes also pro-
        vide a direction and approximate distance. Five or more
        successes allow the Lunar to judge the quality and condition
        (e.g., concealed by Dragon-Blooded machinations)
        of the deposits or items. The Lunar's player may make one
        roll for every 10 minutes that the Charm is active.

        Having existed on the edge of the world, Lunar Exalted
        are ever watchful for the warping effects of the Wyld.
        Though their nature and their tattoos protect them from
        its deforming effects, their associates and non-Lunar kin
        are less fortunate, and their gear is often vulnerable as well.
        Provided the Lunar has sufficient motes available, Wyld-Sensing
        Instincts activates reflexively to alert the Lunar to
        these malign changes. Immediately after it does, the Lunar's
        player may make a (non-reflexive) Perception + Survival
        roll. The number of successes indicates the amount of time
        the Lunar has to act before changes occur. One success
        gives the Lunar a few turns to escape the transformations,
        while three successes indicates he has several minutes to
        reach safety. Five or more successes indicate that, while
        approaching dangerous levels, the chaos is not yet sufficient
        to warp items, and he has as much as 30 minutes to
        seek refuge â€” or to otherwise protect â€” his associates.

        must roll Wits + Linguistics, with the number of successes
        indicating the level of comprehension. One success
        allows him to get the general gist of what's being said,
        while three successes afford solid comprehension. Five or
        more successes allow the Lunar to discern nuances in
        what has been said, be they insults or flattery. The
        Comprehending Ears Meditation does not allow the
        Lunar to speak in a foreign tongue. Comprehending Ears
        Meditation does not allow the Lunar to understand
        nonverbal communication.

        By activating this Charm, a Lunar can attempt to
        both understand and speak any language or dialect
        known by people he has consumed. The Lunar's player
        makes a Wits + Linguistics roll when the Lunar activates
        the Charm. The difficulty is 5 - (the number of people
        who spoke the language the Lunar has eaten the heart's
        blood of). The number of successes on the roll determines
        the Lunar's level of comprehension and fluency.
        One success indicates linguistic abilities comparable
        with a young child, while three successes denote average
        adult abilities. Five or more successes grant the skills of
        a poet. Calls of the Human Prey does not allow the Lunar
        to read or write the language, nor does it make her a
        perfect mimic. If the Lunar has eaten only a few victims
        fluent in a single language, his voice may possess a
        distinct accent that damages his ability to socialize with
        those who dislike his dialect.

        This Charm allows a Lunar to understand and communicate
        with â€” in general if not in precise terms â€” any
        animals in his presence. It functions as per the Comprehending
        Ears Meditation, save with regard to its subjects.
        The Lunar's player makes a Wits + Linguistics roll when
        the Lunar activates the Charm, with a difficulty of 5 -
        (the number of beasts of that species the Lunar has eaten
        the heart's blood of). The Lunar need get only one
        success in most cases, as natural animals are not generally
        articulate. However, if the animal is a complex thinker
        normally unable to communicate, then more successes
        may be relevant. A Lunar using this Charm can automatically
        understand the language of his totem animal
        form (no roll needed).

        Prerequisite Charms: Heightened Hearing and Touch Method<br>
        <br>
        Using this Charm â€” which, in any form, causes his
        ears to enlarge and resemble those of a rabbit or stiff-eared
        dog â€” a Lunar can use his enhanced hearing to
        keep track of others in his immediate vicinity without
        needing to have them in sight. He is dimly aware of the
        others' presence and may reach out with his senses to
        pinpoint them and provide extra information. Doing so
        requires a Perception + Awareness roll, difficulty 1 in
        wilderness conditions, 2 in the streets of a town and 3
        inside a structure. One success indicates that the Lunar
        is aware of those around him, but only in a general sense,
        while three successes provide him with an approximate
        direction and range to each. Five or more successes allow
        the Lunar to pinpoint the others and also provide information
        on their activities, equipment carried and
        movement. The Lunar may use this Charm to track a
        number of others equal to (his Essence x 5) and may
        perceive them out to (his Perception x 100) yards.
        Unless concealed by Charms, those closest to the Lunar
        are revealed first, and those furthest from him last. A
        Storyteller may, at his discretion, identify more distant
        targets first if they are somehow &quot;broadcasting&quot; their
        presence by making lots of noise.

        Prerequisite Charms: Rabbit Ear Method<br>
        <br>
        By focusing his hearing, a Lunar can build a mental
        picture of the surrounding area. Unlike the Rabbit Ear
        Method, which only tracks individuals, Seeing Without
        Looking also allows the Lunar to build up an idea of the
        objects and materials that make up the environs by
        analyzing subtle alterations in the sound of echoes.<br>
        Analyzing the sounds he hears takes the Lunar five
        turns, during which time he may move about at a
        walking pace but cannot take any other actions. If he
        does, the Charm fails. After five turns have elapsed, the
        Exalt's player makes a Perception + Awareness roll.
        The number of successes on this roll determines the
        quality of the Lunar's mental picture and the range to
        which the sense applies.<br>
        One success indicates that the Lunar has a general
        picture of the surroundings, including the position of
        people, beasts and major obstacles. However, he knows
        little about their composition and size and cannot tell
        the difference between two small objects placed close
        together. Three successes let the Lunar refine his
        search, allowing him to identify the materials and
        giving him a finer &quot;resolution&quot; in his mind. Five or
        more successes allow the Lunar to identify most details
        in his immediate area, save those that can only be
        gleaned by sight (such as color). With five successes,
        the Lunar can also identify hidden people and items in
        the vicinity, even if Charms were used as part of the
        concealment process. The Lunar's mental picture extends
        a number of yards equal to (the number of
        successes on the Perception roll x 5). Provided he
        maintains the Charm and carries out no actions other
        than walking, the mental image remains current. However,
        as soon as he carries out a dice action or ceases to
        spend Essence, the picture &quot;locks&quot; though the Lunar
        may still act on the details for the remainder of the
        scene. Thus, a Lunar who wishes to fight blind will
        need to use this Charm to build up a picture of his
        surroundings and Rabbit Ear Method to sense his foes.
        However, such a Lunar might be deceived by sliding
        walls, silently opening pits or other changes that make
        the static picture of his environment obsolete.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can immediately sense
        the blood ties between other individuals. A Lunar's
        player may make a Perception + Awareness roll when
        the character targets the Blood-Kin Sense on an individual.
        If the player gets at least one success, the Lunar
        knows if the person is related to someone else the Lunar
        is familiar with, while three successes give some indication
        of the relationship. Five or more successes allow
        the Lunar to sense firm details of the subjects lineage,
        including a capsule history of the being's ancestor's
        physical abilities for a number of generations back
        equal to the Lunar's Essence. The Blood-Kin Sense
        assumes the Lunar is using scent to study his subject. If
        the Lunar tastes the target's blood, his player gains
        three bonus dice for the roll.

        By means of the Charm, a Lunar can track an
        opponent (or opponents) through almost any terrain.
        To the Lunar, the trail is as clear on solid stone as it is
        in the woodlands or on soft ground. When making a
        tracking roll (Perception + Survival) for the Lunar, her
        player need roll only a single success for the character to
        follow any mundane prey. Furthermore, if the Lunar is
        in beastman form when using this Charm, he is considered
        to be a supernatural tracker, can automatically
        track any mortal target and has a number of automatic
        successes in the tracking contest against other super-
        natural trackers equal to his Essence.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can sense the emotional
        state of her subject, even if there are no outward signs.
        Even if the target appears perfectly calm, his body scent
        will betray him, allowing the Lunar to clearly scent
        strong emotions such as fear, anger, hate and love. Doing
        this does not require a dice roll, though it does count as
        a dice action. The Charm does not, however, automatically
        divine the cause of this emotion or its focus. To
        divine a deeper understanding of the target, the Lunar's
        player must roll Perception + Investigation, the number
        of successes indicating the degree of information gathered.
        One success merely confirms the initial impression,
        while three successes denote the source, target or object
        causing the emotions. Five or more successes allow the
        Lunar to deduce the reason for the emotion.

        By observing subtle physical and chemical responses
        in his subject, a Lunar can determine whether a person
        in his presence is speaking the truth. The Lunar may
        target the Charm at an individual â€” in which case, it
        works automatically â€” or he may use it more generally
        on a body of people. In this latter case, the Lunar's player
        must roll Perception + Investigation, the number of
        successes being the number of people the Exalt can
        successfully observe. The Truth-Scenting Method does
        not detect evasions or statements that twist the truth
        without actually being falsehoods. Furthermore, some
        &quot;truths&quot; are subjective, and it is the target's view, not
        that of the perceiving Lunar, which determines truth.<br>
        For Example: If a subject says, &quot;I saw him do it,&quot; when
        he saw no such thing, the Lunar can detect the lie. However,
        the Charm will not detect a lie if the subject states, &quot;No, Janek
        didn't pay me anything&quot; (because Marcos did), as it is an
        evasion, not an outright lie.
