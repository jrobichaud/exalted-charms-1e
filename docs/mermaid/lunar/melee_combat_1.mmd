        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can perceive the
        flows of Essence around his target, using them to guide
        his blows to best effect. For each mote of Essence spent
        on this Charm, the Lunar gains an additional attack die
        on a single Melee attack. These bonus dice may not
        exceed the character's Dexterity.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can imbue his weapon
        with preternatural speed, using his Essence and instincts
        to enhance the tempo of his attack. When rolling initiative
        for a turn in which the character plans to make a
        Melee attack, the Lunar may spend Essence to improve
        his initiative rating for a single turn, each mote buying a
        +1 modifier. The character cannot spend more motes
        than he has points of Dexterity. The Essence cost of the
        Charm is paid before making the initiative roll. The
        Striking Raptor Method cannot be used in a Combo with
        any other Charm that gives an initiative bonus.

        <br>
        By fortifying his attacking weapon with Essence, a
        Lunar can make it very difficult for his opponent to block
        a single attack with a hand-to-hand weapon. Players
        rolling to defend against this attack must roll two successes
        for each of the Exalt's own successes they seek to
        negate. If a defender rolls an odd number of successes, the
        extra success is wasted.<br>
        For Example: Red Jaw uses the Ferocious Biting Sword
        to enhance his attacks on a Solar. His reaver daiklave,
        Winter's Heart, arcs round at the enemy, and Red Jaw's
        player gets four successes on the attack. The Storyteller rolls
        the Solar's parry and gets seven successes. Ordinarily, this
        would cancel out Red Jaw's attack, but as the Ferocious
        Biting Sword Charm was in effect, it only cancels three of the
        successes, with the seventh success on the parry discarded.
        With one success remaining, Red Jaw's attack succeeds.

        These may be against the same foe or against multiple
        foes within a distance in yards equal to the Lunar's
        Dexterity. Each additional attack costs 3 motes of
        Essence, and the Lunar may purchase no more additional
        attacks than he has points of Essence. Each
        attack is made with the Lunar's full dice pool and must
        be parried or dodged separately. A Lunar can buy no
        more extra actions than (the initiative on which he
        activated this Charm Ã· 3, rounded down). This
        normally means (the character's initiative Ã· 3), but
        Lunars who hold their action and then invoke this
        Charm may lose extra actions.

        foes and force them onto the defensive. The Irresistible
        Storm Attack allows the Lunar to make a
        number of Melee attacks equal to his Essence. All
        the foes targeted by this Charm must be within a
        number of yards of the Lunar equal to twice his
        Dexterity. Each target of the Irresistible Storm Attack
        is subject to a full attack. In addition, for each
        additional mote the character spends, he may force
        all his opponents to either give up one yard of
        ground or give him a bonus Dexterity die, as per the
        Ferocious Avalanche Technique. The Irresistible
        Storm Attack cannot be used in a Combo with
        Charms that grant extra attack dice or extra actions.
        As with the Ferocious Avalanche Technique, the
        maximum number of bonus dice the character can
        gain is equal to his Dexterity. Each attack must be at
        a different foe, and no foe can be attacked more than
        once. Unused extra attacks are wasted.

        weapons can attack a single opponent twice in a
        single turn. One action is made with each weapon. Each
        attack uses the Lunar's full dice pool at the character's
        full initiative score, and neither attack is considered to
        be with the character's off hand. The Lunar using the
        Spinning Blade Attack may abort one or both of these
        attacks to parries and, thus, can attack twice, attack and
        parry or parry twice at his full dice pool in the same turn,

        Using this Charm, the Lunar becomes a whirling

        aware of his surroundings. While using this Charm, the
        Lunar gets an initiative bonus equal to half (round down)
        the number of yards he moved the previous turn. The
        Charm remains active so long as the Lunar keeps moving
        and commits Essence to it. If he is forced to stop moving,
        the Charm ends. Additionally, while the Charm is active,
        the Lunar can turn to meet any attack and cannot be
        ambushed or attacked from the rear. The Dust Devil
        Advance cannot be used in a Combo with any other
        Charm that gives an initiative bonus. This Charm cannot

        keeping her off balance by force of arms and wearing
        down her defenses until she makes a deadly error. When

        dice normally, but if the player gets 3 or more successes
        (not extra successes) on the attack roll, the Lunar may
        immediately attack the same target again. If the second
        attack also gets 3 successes, the Lunar can attack again,
        and so on, up to a maximum number of attacks equal to
        the Lunar's Dexterity. All attacks must be at the same
        target. Damage for each attack is resolved normally
        before the next attack is launched, so unless the target
        has powerful defensive Charms, she will surely falter.

        The Lunar may combine his mastery of weapons and
        his protean nature to counter the efforts of an unwary
        foe, adjusting his weapon's path at the last moment to
        negate defensive moves. If an opponent attempts to
        parry a Lunar's Melee attack but does not completely
        block it, the Lunar's player can use the Monkey Paw
        Advantage to reroll the parried successes as another
        attack with the same weapon, paying 1 mote per die
        rerolled. If the opponent has actions remaining, she can
        attempt to parry these rerolled attack dice. The Monkey
        Paw Advantage confers no benefit if the target dodges.

        In addition to proving a major advantage in weaving
        past an opponents defenses, a Lunar's protean flexibility

        merely extends her limbs and alters the way her joints
        move in order to give her a considerable edge. When
        attempting a disarming attack (see Exalted, pp. 238-
        239), the Lunar can purchase additional dice up to her
        Dexterity. When using this Charm, the difficulty of
        disarming in melee combat decreases to 2. The target
        may parry the attempt as usual, but his player's reflexive
        Wits + Melee roll requires one more success than the
        Lunar's disarming roll to be effective.

        Even allowing for the reach of limbs and weapons,
        melee combat requires the combatants to be within a
        few yards of each other. Longer weapons â€” such as
        pole arms â€” can confer considerable advantages,
        particularly when facing mounted opponents. Lunar
        Exalted may adjust their bodies to adjust circum-
        stances in their favor â€” they can elongate one or both
        limbs, allowing them to attack opponents some dis-
        tance. A Lunar using this Charm may attack at a
        distance of up to his Essence in yards. If the opponent
        is more than three yards from the Lunar, she will be
        unable to make a hand-to-hand counterattack and
        must move before engaging the Exalt in hand-to-hand
        combat. Any weapon wielded in this manner â€” even
        a knife â€” is considered a long weapon, and the Lunar
        does not suffer the usual penalties for attacking mounted
        opponents from on foot.

        By lunging at his foe and binding Essence into his
        attacks, a Lunar can inflict monstrous damage on his
        opponent. The shocking impact of such an attack is
        devastating and quite often ends the battle in the Lunar's
        favor. The Lunar may enhance a single Melee attack by
        buying additional damage dice at a cost of 3 motes per
        die. The maximum number of points that can be added
        is equal to the Lunar's Strength rating. This must be done
        before the attack is rolled.<br>
        The attack may be dodged as normal, but the
        difficulty of parrying an attack augmented with this
        Charm is greatly increased. All parry attempts must first
        overcome a base difficulty equal to the number of motes
        spent fueling Tiger Claw Swat before they subtract
        successes from the attack. This doesn't enhance the
        attack. They simply increase the difficulty of the target's
        parry and do not add to the damage of the Lunar's
        attack. The difficulty modifier is applied first and must
        be overcome before the extra successes can be applied
        to defending against the Lunar's blow. Tiger Claw Swat

        Scars are an integral part of Lunar Exalted society,
        maintaining the Lunars' form and used as a means of
        counting coup. Scarring an opponent, without causing
        serious injury, is an unsubtle means of demonstrating
        martial superiority. A Lunar enacting this Charm can
        turn the Dexterity dice in his Dexterity + Melee attack
        pool into automatic successes when attempting to mark
        a target (see Exalted, p. 238). The opponent may parry
        or dodge as normal, reducing the net successes for the
        marking attempt.<br>
        Ritual scarring forms part of several Lunar events,
        and the Scar-Making Blow is used in some cases to
        impart the markings. In such cases, the target willingly
        undergoes the marking, and the number of successes
        needed to mark the target is reduced to 1. Scars imparted
        by this Charm are simply the product of healing and lack
        the magical strength of those imparted by the No Moon
        Caste's Form-Fixing Method.

        By making a series of swift and decisive blows, a
        Lunar can unbalance his opponent. By using the
        Ferocious Avalanche Technique, the Lunar forces
        his opponent to give ground. For each mote of Essence
        spent by the Lunar, his target must either back
        off a yard or allow the Lunar to gain a bonus attack
        die. If the opponent has not yet acted this turn or has
        moved less than half his move allowance, he may
        back off as a reflexive action. If the opponent does not
        (or cannot) back away, the Lunar gains a number of
        bonus attack dice equal to the distance the target
        didn't move. The maximum bonus the Lunar can
        gain from this attack is equal to his Dexterity, and
        these are Dexterity bonus dice.<br>
        For example: A Lunar attacks and puts 3 motes of
        Essence into the Ferocious Avalanche Technique. His opponent
        must either back up three yards or else the Lunar gains
        +3 attack dice. If the opponent backed up a yard but could go
        no further due to an obstacle, the Lunar would gain + 2 attack
        dice (3 - the distance in yards moved).

        Using the Limb-Maiming Flourish, a Lunar uses
        Essence to maximize the lethal effect of her weapon,
        guiding it to the points that will do most damage.
        When rolling damage, any 10s on the damage dice
        count as two successes. After determining the actual
        amount of damage inflicted, the Lunar may reduce one
        of the victim's Physical Attributes or Appearance by
        one instead of inflicting two health levels of damage.
        This may not reduce an Attribute below 1, nor may it
        be used to convert all damage into Attribute loss â€” the
        target must loose at least one health level per Attribute
        point lost. An Exalted requires a week of healing to
        recover each Attribute point lost, but such injuries are
        permanent if inflicted on mortals. Limb-Maiming Flourish
        cannot be used in a Combo with other Charms that
        increase damage dice.

        Most competent swordsmen can adjust their blows
        so as to cause bashing damage to their targets. The
        Lunar Exalted are considerably more formidable than
        any mortal swordsman, and their Essence-laden blows
        can fell even a Terrestrial. By means of the Thunderclap
        Method, a Lunar increases the strength of a Melee
        attack while softening its impact, so that it will only
        fell an enemy, rather than slay her. A blow enhanced
        by this Charm rings like thunder, stunning the opponent.
        Any attack enhanced with this Charm
        automatically does only bashing damage, but after
        subtracting soak from the damage of the attack, the
        Lunar can activate this Charm and pay 1 mote to
        change a remaining die of damage to an automatic
        success. Each remaining die becomes an automatic
        success, inflicting a level of bashing damage. A Lunar
        cannot buy more automatic damage successes in this
        fashion than he has points of Strength. The Charm
        cannot be part of a Combo with any other Charm that
        grants automatic damage successes.

        The Lunar's mastery of moonsilver weapons allows
        her to imbue such a weapon with Essence, causing it to
        flow and flatten, rather than crush or cut. With the use of
        this Charm, the Lunar can cause a single attack with a
        moonsilver weapon to inflict bashing damage rather than
        lethal without subtracting a success from her attack action
        as per the normal pulling blows rules (see Exalted, p. 238).

        <br>
        Moonsilver weapons have an innate link to the
        Lunar Exalted, affording them considerable advantages
        in combat. Combining this Charm with a moonsilver
        weapon's fluid nature increases the difficulty of parrying
        or dodging the weapon; the weapon simply flows around
        the opponent's defenses or anticipates the defensive
        moves. Increase the number of successes needed to parry
        or dodge a single attack with a moonsilver weapon by up
        to the Exalt's Essence, at a cost of 2 per additional success
        required. These simply increase the difficulty of the
        target's parry roll and do not add to the damage of the
        Lunar's attack. The difficulty modifier is applied first and
        must be overcome before the extra successes can be
        applied to defend against the Lunar's blow. This Charm
        has no effect if the parrying weapon is also made of
        moonsilver, nor is it effective when attacking with
        moonsilver talons or teeth.

        By means of this Charm, a Lunar can further
        exploit his weapon's fluid form, rendering it into a truly
        devastating tool, for the edge flows into blows, seeking
        to widen and deepen cuts or reshaping itself to smash
        bones for maximum effect. When making a damage
        roll for a moonsilver weapon, the Lunar's player can
        purchase additional damage dice up to the weapon's
        damage rating. These points are added before soak is
        applied. Bonus dice of damage up to the Lunar's
        Strength cost 1 mote each, while those that exceed the
        character's Strength cost 3 motes each. Deadly
        Moonsilver Affinity cannot be used as part of a Combo
        with other Charms that increase the damage value or
        extra successes of an attack.

        A moonsilver weapon's edge is its most lethal aspect,
        inflicting heinous damage on the Lunar's foes. It is
        not, however, the only harm such weapons can inflict. A
        more insidious option is open to appropriately minded
        Lunars. By activating this Charm, the Lunar empowers
        his moonsilver weapon so that it gains a purpose even
        when beyond his hands. If the blow is successful, a
        fragment of the blade breaks off in the wound, remaining
        to cause grievous harm to the victim. The player must
        pay for the Charm before making the attack roll. For the
        magic to have effect, the attack must be successful and
        must inflict at least one health level of damage.<br>
        The attack does damage as normal, and a shard of
        moonsilver remains in the wound, slowly working its way
        through the victim's body. This causes one die of lethal
        damage per day and continues to cause damage until it is
        removed. Removing the shard requires at least Medicine
        3 and is Challenging (requires 3 successes). The removal
        procedure causes five dice of lethal damage, minus one
        die per extra success (to a minimum of 1L). Charms that
        heal aggravated damage, such as Bodily Regeneration
        Prana, can also be used to expel a moonsilver shard, as
        can a shapeshifting stunt. Activating this Charm lowers
        the weapon's damage rating by 1 until the next night the
        moon is full.
