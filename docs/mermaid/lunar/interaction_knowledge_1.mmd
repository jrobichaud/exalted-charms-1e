        Lunar society has little in the way of a written
        tradition, instead preferring to pass information down
        orally. Much of the history and many of the traditions of
        the Lunar Exalted take the form of stories â€” some based
        on history, others simply parables â€” and learning how to
        tell a story is an important skill in Lunar society, particularly
        among the No Moons. Much of this is simply
        learned, part of the Performance Ability, but a master
        storyteller knows how to use Essence and his shapeshifting
        powers to enhance the tale. The exact method will
        depend on the audience â€” speaking to youngsters might
        involve lots of noise and action, while, with adults,
        delivery may be a major factor â€” but the Lunar can use
        his abilities to shape his voice and actions accordingly.
        Normally, the Charm affects five subjects, but for each
        additional mote spent, the speaker can increase his
        audience by a further five people. A Lunar with sufficient
        Essence can use Tale-Spinning Mastery to address a
        crowd, though it is an inefficient method.
        While Tale-Spinning Mastery is in effect, the
        Lunar's player can add bonus dice to any test involving
        storytelling, though the bonus may not exceed the
        character's Charisma. The Storyteller may increase the
        difficulty of the roll if the audience is hostile, disinclined
        to listen or otherwise distracted. The audience
        must be able to comprehend the Lunar's speech for the
        Charm to work.

        Most Lunars do not believe in writing. Instead,
        their history, traditions and knowledge are conveyed
        orally. Each No Moon teaches the rudiments to the
        youngsters whose bodies he tattoos. By using the Lore-Speaking
        Method, a Lunar can enter a meditative
        trance and search his memories for relevant information.
        The trance lasts for a minimum of 30 minutes, but
        may be extended if he wishes, providing the Lunar
        with additional time to search his memories. At the
        end of the meditation, the Lunar's player makes an
        Intelligence + Wits roll, adding a bonus die for each
        additional 10 minutes the character spent in meditation,
        to a maximum bonus of his dots of Intelligence.
        The difficulty of the roll depends on the nature of the
        information he seeks â€” 1 for routine matters, 3 for
        more obscure facts and 5 for esoteric knowledge the No
        Moon may have mentioned in passing â€” and the net
        successes determine the strength and clarity of the
        recollection. The Storyteller may keep the exact difficulty
        secret, instead telling the Lunar how sure he is of
        the memory. If the Lunar's player rolls no successes or
        if the Exalt is interrupted before 30 minutes have
        elapsed, the Charm fails.

        Sometimes, a Lunar has need of information he does
        not know. In routine matters, he can turn to the No
        Moons, who may be able to provide what he needs in
        return for a boon, but even the No Moons are fallible.
        Some information can only be acquired from outside
        sources. A civilized Lunar might trek into the Threshold
        or even the Realm proper in his quest for information.
        Those with closer ties to the Wyld, however, do not allow
        the restrictive trappings of civilization to bind their
        thought patterns and will seek knowledge from their
        ancestors and friendly sprits by means of a vision quest.<br>
        Entering a deep trance, the Lunar allows his mind
        and spirit to wander free, perhaps aided by psychotropic
        fungi or the crushed essence of certain beetles. This
        trance may last for hours or days, and there is no guaran-
        tee of success. The Lunar's mind wanders in search of the
        truth it desires, traversing the landscape of his own
        psyche. He may encounter &quot;spirits,&quot; which are, in fact,
        creations of his mind, guiding him on his quest for divine
        inspiration. The difficulty of the vision quest is knowing
        when to trust his senses and instincts and when to reject
        them; a Lunar in this trance cannot easily distinguish
        between what is a real insight and what is his imagination.
        The Lunar may emerge enlightened, or he may be
        confounded by what he has seen. Indeed, external forces
        aware of the Lunar's endeavor might seek to manipulate
        the quest to their own ends, passing on their interference
        as &quot;divine&quot; inspiration.<br>
        At the end of the vision quest, which lasts a number
        of hours equal to the Lunar's Essence, his player may ask
        a single question and roll Perception + Lore. The difficulty
        of the roll is at the Storyteller's discretion and
        depends on the nature of the information sought. &quot;Routine&quot;
        information requires only a single success, while
        hidden knowledge â€” obscured deliberately or otherwise
        â€” requires at least three successes and possibly
        even five. Irrespective of the size of his dice pool, a Lunar
        may not count more successes than his permanent
        Essence Trait. He must discard any extras. Failing this
        roll can have devastating effects. If the Lunar gets at
        least one success but not enough to succeed, he simply
        wakes none the wiser. Failure, however, leaves the
        Lunar disoriented and forced to soak a number of dice of
        bashing damage equal to his Essence. A botch leaves him
        catatonic for a number of days equal to his Essence and may
        also result in a derangement.

        Using this Charm to expand his lungs and vocal cords,
        a Lunar can transform his normal voice into a formidable
        roar. Anything the Lunar says while the Charm is in effect is
        clearly audible to anyone within a number of yards equal
        to (the Lunar's Essence x 100) and to those with acute hearing
        for twice that distance. A Lunar can also use the Lion
        Roar Method as a pseudo- weapon by roaring at an
        individual within 10 yards. That individual must make a
        reflexive Stamina + Endurance roll against a difficulty
        equal to his own Perception. If the target fails, he temporarily
        loses a point of Perception and must attempt
        to soak a number of levels of bashing damage equal to the
        Lunar's Stamina. The Charm actually changes the
        character's body, and the Essence is committed (and the
        effect available) until the character releases the Essence
        committed to the effect.

        Winds circulate around the world, and while not as
        skilled as the Dragon-Blooded at manipulating the elements,
        some Lunars do know how to call upon the wind
        and use it to convey messages to their allies. Upon
        activating this Charm, the Lunar whispers a few words
        (his Essence score x 5 in words maximum) and names a
        recipient. The Exalt's player then rolls Wits + Linguistics.
        The difficulty of the roll depends on the range to the
        intended recipient; if he is within a 1,000 yards, it is
        difficulty 1, while up to a mile requires two successes.
        Three or more successes allow the message to travel up to
        five miles. The recipient must be known to the Lunar
        and must have spoken to him at some point in the past.
        The target is the only person to hear the message -
        sending messages to multiple recipients requires multiple
        invocations of the Charm.

        <br>
        The Emotion Shaping Technique enhances a Lunar's
        already considerable presence, using a combination of
        charisma, insight and timing to allow the Exalt to manipulate
        the emotional responses of his audience. The
        target must be capable of understanding the Exalt for the
        Charm to function correctly but need not be paying full
        attention to what is being said; the Lunar's words and the
        Charm work on the subconscious as much as on the
        conscious mind. The Lunar's player rolls Manipulation +
        Presence, and each success allows the Lunar to temporarily
        increase or decrease one of the target's Virtues by
        a point. This may not increase the Virtue above 5, nor
        may it reduce it below 1. Additionally, a Virtue may not
        be altered by more than two â€” even under the influence
        of this Charm, a paragon of valor will not become a
        sniveling coward. The Lunar's successes need not, however,
        be applied to the same Virtue or even to the same
        target. Two successes could be applied one to each of two
        Virtues or two to one or even one to a Virtue of one
        character and one to a Virtue of another. However, other
        Charms such as the Crowd-Inciting Method and Courage-Building
        Address are better able to manipulate large
        numbers of people. This power does not work on spirits
        or any sort.

        address and be heard by the crowd, his player rolling
        Manipulation + Performance against a difficulty dependant
        on the size of the crowd (difficulty +1 per 50
        people or fraction thereof). If the roll succeeds, the
        player may spend successes to temporarily reduce the
        Temperance or Compassion Virtues of the crowd by a
        maximum of 2 dots each and not below 1 (meaning that
        if the Exalt has more than four successes, they are
        wasted), perhaps making it more amenable to other
        suggestions. A failed roll has no effect, but a botch may
        result in the crowd turning on the speaker.

        In battle, numbers are rarely the deciding factor.
        Instead, troop quality is often the key, and courage is the
        cornerstone of troop quality. By means of the Courage-Building
        Address, a Lunar can instill a sense of bravery
        in his troops, increasing their Valor Virtue for the
        duration of the battle by means of an inspirational
        speech (which requires at least five minutes). While the
        Lunar makes the speech, his player should make a Manipulation
        + Performance roll (difficulty 2 if the Lunar
        is the unit commander or another notable individual, 3
        otherwise). For every two successes gained, the Valor of

        Insults are part of Lunar combat ritual â€” deriding an
        opponent's reputation is almost as effective a wound as
        that caused by a blade. However, most Lunars are inured
        to the taunts, ignoring them as part of the formalities. By
        means of this Charm, however, the Lunar gains insight
        into what barbs will get under an opponent's skin and
        make her react. The Lunar's player makes a Manipulation
        + Presence roll against a difficulty equal to the
        opponent's Temperance. If the roll succeeds, the target
        may be angered by the comments and fight badly, or he
        may even fly into a howling rage.<br>
        With one or two successes, the target is distracted
        and subtracts one success from all attacks, dodges and
        parries until the end of the next turn. Three or four
        successes indicate the comments have really gotten
        under the opponent's skin. In addition to the previous
        penalties, the target's player's next initiative roll is
        reduced by 3. Five or more successes indicate the target
        goes wild; she may not parry or dodge any attacks, nor
        may she attack anyone other than the Lunar who taunted
        her for the remainder of the battle. However, the target
        is not subject to any initiative or attack roll penalties.
        This Charm may only be used on a single foe. The target
        may use Willpower to offset its effects, each point allow-
        ing her to offset all the taunt-induced penalties for the
        turn. The target must be within (the Lunar's Essence x

        The Glib Tongue Technique builds on a Lunar's
        presence, allowing him to persuade an individual to act
        (or not) as the Lunar sees fit. The Lunar's player makes
        a Manipulation + Presence roll with a difficulty equal
        to the target's permanent Essence. The net successes
        determine if the Lunar's manipulation succeeds or not.
        If the Lunar's player rolled one extra success, the
        subject is predisposed to the Exalt's suggestion and will
        likely do as the Lunar desires providing no other influences
        (Charms, other persuasion attempts) come into
        to play. Three additional successes guarantee the
        subject's immunity of mortal persuasion, but she is still
        open to magical manipulations that convince her to do
        other than what the Lunar says. Five or more extra
        successes mean the subject will do as desired and
        cannot be swayed. Furthermore, she will do so as soon
        as possible, even at great risk to herself.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can overwhelm someone
        he is speaking to with his physical presence. Some use
        Essence to modify their size, making themselves physically
        larger, while others take on a more terrifying visage.
        A few are less obvious, simply exuding menace and using
        barely controlled fury to scare the person they are facing.
        When the Lunar makes an intimidation attempt (see
        Exalted, p. 242), his player may purchase additional dice
        up to the Exalt's unmodified Manipulation score.

        The battle-form of a Lunar is a fearsome sight and
        more-or-less guarantees the success of an intimidation
        effort. When making an intimidation roll, the Lunar's
        player may convert a number of dice up to his character's
        Manipulation Attribute into automatic successes. Fearful
        Lunar Form is as effective against groups as it is against
        individuals; make one roll, and apply it to all who behold
        the Exalt's deadly glory.

        A Lunar may focus his intimidation efforts on a
        single individual, seeking not only to force him into
        submission, but also to shatter his will. If successful, the
        subject's mind will be overwhelmed, perhaps rendering
        him unconscious or causing a derangement but certainly
        damaging his short-term memory. The Lunar's player
        rolls Manipulation + Presence against a difficulty equal
        to the target's Essence. Success indicates that the target
        has forgotten what happened in the last minute and each
        additional success increases this mind-blanking period
        by a minute. Mind-Blanking Fear Technique may only
        be targeted on an individual, and the Lunar employing it
        must be in beastman form.

        Speech is only one method of manipulating others.
        Scent and body language can also play a part, particularly
        in more feral circumstances. A Lunar may attempt to use
        his protean nature to manipulate others by such nonverbal
        means, altering his posture, scent and a host of other
        factors to better influence others. When making a Social
        roll, the Lunar's player may purchase additional dice up
        to his character's Charisma at a cost of 3 motes each.
        Such manipulation only works on targets within a num-
        ber of yards equal to the Lunar's Essence, though they
        need not understand his language (or even be able to
        hear him) to be affected.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can modify the mental
        state of a beast or a group of animals. This may be a
        ravening pack of wolves he seeks to pacify, or it may be
        a skittish packhorse he wants to calm. The difficulty of
        the Manipulation + Survival roll depends on the nature
        of and number of the animals he seeks to influence. One
        success would allow the Lunar to walk past a rabbit
        without causing it to bolt, while three successes would
        hold a ravening pack of wolves in check. Five or more
        successes would cause even the mighty tyrant lizard to
        stand in abeyance. The target animals need not understand
        the words of an Exalt seeking to calm them to be
        affected by the Charm.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can seek to command
        beasts to do his bidding. To do so, his player must make
        a series of Manipulation + Survival rolls over a period
        of several days of game time, during which time the
        Essence must remain committed. If the beasts are already
        friendly to the Lunar, he must accumulate one
        success for each beast he seeks to command, whereas, if
        they are neutral, three successes are needed for each.
        Hostile or fearful beasts cannot be easily commanded
        and must generally be convinced to give the Lunar a
        chance, usually by means of the Beast Calming Method.
        However, if the Lunar gets five successes with this
        Charm, even the most hostile beasts will acknowledge
        the Lunar as their pack-leader. Beasts commanded in
        this way remain loyal to the Lunar for a number of
        months equal to his Essence. After that time, he must
        either rework the Charm or trust to natural friendship.
        The Lunar may command a total number of beasts equal
        to (Charisma + Survival) x 10 via this Charm, though
        he may command more through natural loyalty.<br>
        The cost of this Charm is paid per group of beasts
        (if the beasts are social animals) or against individuals
        (if they are lone animals). If the character spends 1
        experience point when he uses the Charm and uses it
        only on a single creature, then he may spend an
        experience point to increase his Familiar rating with
        that beast by 1. A character cannot get a new familiar
        unless his old one has died and cannot have more than
        one familiar at a time. See the Solar Charm Spirit Tied
        Pet on page 179 of Exalted and the Familiar Background
        on page 143 for details.

        Though Lunars often live and act alone, they can
        form strong friendships and associations, similar to Solar
        Circles, which they call &quot;packs.&quot; This camaraderie is a
        rare gift, but it is not the ultimate expression of a Lunar's
        loyalty. That ultimate expression is the Brotherhood of
        Lake and River, a bond of blood and Essence forged
        between the Lunar and his adopted brother. To partake
        in the Brotherhood of Lake and River, the Lunar and his
        sibling-to-be must cut the palm of their fellow's hands
        and bind the wounds together for at least 10 minutes
        while the Charm is activated. From that point on, the
        Lunar is always dimly aware of his wolf-sibling's direction
        and distance and will know if the other sustains
        serious injury or is killed. When in close proximity â€”
        within 100 yards or so â€” the Lunar may even read his
        wolf-sibling's surface thoughts. If the two have used the
        Charm reciprocally, they may even speak without words
        when within 100 yards of one another. The effects of the
        Charm are permanent and can only be broken by death.
        The maximum number of wolf-siblings a Lunar may
        have is equal to twice his Essence, though only one bond
        is formed with each use of the Charm. If such a packmate
        dies, another may take his place in the Lunar's heart.
        This Charm's effects are not automatically reciprocal.
        To establish a reciprocal link, two Lunars must use the
        Charm on one another.

        A Lunar hunting alone is a fearsome sight. One
        hunting with her associates is a nightmare for her enemies.
        She can exploit the blood and Essence ties to her
        allies, tapping into their senses and battlefield knowl-
        edge to gain a decisive edge. Before rolling initiative
        each turn, the Lunar can activate Blood-Singing Instincts,
        paying motes of Essence up to the number of
        allies present who are wolf-siblings of the Lunar through
        the Charm Brotherhood of Lake and River. Each mote of
        Essence spent in this manner adds 1 to the Lunar's
        player's initiative roll for the turn. Multiple Lunars can
        use one another to increase their initiative, making
        Lunars who hunt as a pack into the deadliest of foes.

        By crying into the wind and sounding the Pack-Calling
        Cry, a Lunar uses the blood ties to his wolf-siblings
        in the Brotherhood of Lake and River to summon them
        into his presence. The Lunar may attempt to summon
        any number of those bound to him by the Brotherhood
        of Lake and River, each costing 1 mote of Essence. If
        summoning less than his full pack, the Lunar can select
        which of his packmates receive the summons.<br>
        The call can be heard over any distance, implanting
        the desire to return to the Lunar's presence as soon as
        possible. The wolf-sibling has some leeway in deciding
        how quickly to heed the call (a few minutes if nearby,
        perhaps hours if miles away and days if hundreds or
        thousands of miles distant), but if she seeks to delay
        beyond this time, her player must make a Willpower roll
        against a difficulty equal to the calling Lunar's Charisma.
        Success allows the target to resist the call for the same
        time period again, and if her player is successful a number
        of times (which need not be consecutive) equal to the
        calling Lunar's Essence, the desire to return fades away.
        Failure means the target must immediately break off
        what she is doing and set off toward the caller, though she
        may attempt to resist after each day of travel.
