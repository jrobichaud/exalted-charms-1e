        A Lunar Exalted can use this Charm to sharpen his
        hand-eye coordination, making it easier to strike ranged
        targets. Careful observers (a reflexive Perception +
        Awareness roll, difficulty 3) will notice a change in the
        Lunar's eyes â€” they take on an avian aspect - but
        otherwise, his form is unchanged. When making an
        Archery or Thrown attack against a ranged target, the
        Lunar may convert attack dice into automatic successes.
        He may not, however, purchase more successes than his
        Dexterity score.

        By listening to his animal instincts, a Lunar can
        compensate for adverse environmental effects such as
        wind and rain on the flight path of his missile. The arrow
        always flies true, allowing the Exalt to ignore all environmental
        penalties during an Archery or Thrown attack.
        Nature's Harmony Advantage does not compensate for
        reduced visibility and must be included in a Combo with
        the Wolf Eye Advantage if the Lunar is to avoid all
        environmental penalties for ranged attacks.

        By using his Essence to alter the arrow's flight, a
        Lunar can attack two targets with a single arrow, usually
        by shooting through the first target into the second. Both
        victims must be within two yards of each other. The
        Lunar's player makes a single Archery + Dexterity attack
        roll. If it succeeds, the successes are split as equally as
        possible between the two targets, who each may attempt
        to parry or dodge the attack as normal. If the Lunar's
        player rolls only one success, he picks who he attacks.
        Regardless of how the attack is described, determine the
        arrow's damage normally against target hit (i.e., arrows
        boosted by this Charm are not &quot;slowed down&quot; by passing
        through the chest of the first target, beyond dividing the
        successes of the attack).

        Shifting her body to give it an efficient, fluid grace,
        a Lunar archer can load and fire her bow with preternatural
        speed. For every 3 motes spent activating the Charm,
        the Lunar can make an additional Thrown or Archery
        attack, which may be at her first target or at any other
        target in range. The player must declare the number of
        attacks the Lunar is making before paying to activate the
        Charm. The player cannot buy more extra attacks than
        her character's permanent Essence Trait, nor can she buy
        more extra actions than (the initiative on which the
        character activated this Charm Ã· 3, rounded down).
        This normally means (the character's initiative + 3), but
        Lunars who hold their action and then invoke this
        Charm may lose extra actions. Each attack uses the
        character's full dice pool. The character cannot make an
        attack unless she has the ammunition to do so.

        Using this Charm to speed his drawing and firing,
        the Lunar can loft a series of arrows before the first has
        hit its target. Unlike regular shots, which are aimed at
        an individual, the Rain of Feathered Doom targets an
        area. The Lunar may fire as many arrows as (his
        Dexterity x the rate of the bow), subject to the number
        of arrows and motes of Essence available. For every
        two arrows fired, the Lunar may target a single individual,
        and each individual targeted costs 2 motes of
        Essence. All of the targets must be within (the Lunar's
        Dexterity) yards equal to of a center point picked by
        the Lunar. The targets do not gain the benefits of any
        movement or cover, so thick do the arrows fly. Make
        one attack roll, and apply it to all the targets, increasing
        the base difficulty of each attack by 1. Irrespective
        of the number of arrows fired, the Lunar may attack
        each target only once during the turn (the extra
        arrows are wasted).

        To an Exalt who can hit a dipping swallow at 100
        yards, striking a projectile in flight is only slightly more
        challenging. Using this Charm, the Lunar can attempt
        to deflect a ranged attack aimed at him by using a
        missile of his own. Toattempt this, the Lunar must have
        the bow and ammunition ready. The player makes a
        reflexive Dexterity + Archery or Thrown roll, with
        each success reducing the attacker's successes. If the
        Lunar's player rolls at least as many successes as the
        attacker's, the attack is disrupted in flight and causes no
        damage. If the Lunar's player does not equal or exceed
        the attacker's successes, then the attacker's successes
        are still reduced. This defense is only effective against
        ranged attacks, and the Lunar must expend one arrow
        per activation of this Charm.

        While Finding the Needle's Eye allows an Exalt to
        use arrows to defend himself from enemy missile
        attacks, protecting his allies is a more difficult task.
        Not only must he observe the path of projectiles
        inbound against multiple targets, but firing at those
        targets often requires him to hit a crossing target, not
        an issue when the Lunar himself was the target. The
        Arrow-Breaking Shot functions like Finding the
        Needle's Eye, save that that each deflection attempt
        costs more Essence and requires the number of successes
        to exceed those of the attacker for the deflection
        to be successful. As with Finding the Needle's Eye,
        above, the Charm can be used only against ranged
        attacks, and the Lunar must expend one arrow with
        each activation of the Charm.

        Using this Charm, a Lunar can negate an opponent's
        cover by bouncing his missile off of several surfaces, his
        enhanced senses allowing him to calculate an unerring
        trajectory for a single Thrown or Archery attack. Each
        surface the missile must bounce off of to reach its target
        subtracts 1 from the attack's damage (meaning the
        character's Strength + the weapon's damage bonus). If
        the total damage reaches 0, the weapon's energy is spent,
        and it falls to the ground.

        So long as he is surrounded by raw materials â€” stones,
        twigs, bones, reeds, long blades of grass and the like â€” a
        Lunar will not run out of ammunition. Instead of drawing
        arrows from his quiver, the Lunar may instead pick up an
        appropriate piece of raw material â€” anything long and
        thin for arrows, and anything of roughly the correct shape
        for thrown weapons - and transform it into a missile
        suitable for firing from the bow or for throwing. The arrow
        retains the appearance of the raw material, but in the
        hands of the Lunar, it is a functional but non-magical item
        of that type. Only the Lunar can use weapons he has
        shaped. He can shape a maximum number of missiles equal
        to his Dexterity in a single turn and must use them within
        a number of turns equal to his Essence, for at the end of
        that time they revert to their raw form. Missiles embedded
        in their victims when they revert do an extra IL damage.

        By sharpening his senses, a Lunar can offset the
        disadvantage of poor visibility (but not for the effects of
        wind, rain and the like) on a missile's flight path. Activating
        this Charm allows the Lunar to treat visibility ranges
        as double their value for the purposes of a single Archery
        or Thrown attack. For example, on a foggy day the Lunar
        can attacks targets without penalty out to 20 yards and
        with +1 difficulty out to 60 yards. Furthermore, when
        using this Charm, a Lunar can make a blind attack out to
        200 yards and treats all night conditions as day (further
        including increasing visibility distances). See page 237 of

        All bows have a pull, and beyond this upper limit, the
        archer's strength has no appreciable effect, except perhaps
        to break the bow. Using this Charm to control his actions
        and Essence to reinforce the weapon, the Lunar can coax
        extra performance out of the bow. When firing, the Lunar's
        player must state the Strength the Lunar is using and can
        as much as double a bow's maximum Strength without
        harming the weapon. The player may increase the maximum
        Strength beyond double, but doing so requires him to
