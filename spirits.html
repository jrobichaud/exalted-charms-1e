        Measure the Wind&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 1 mote&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This power enables the spirit to sense nearby Essence,
        whether it exists in objects or within Exalted. Rolls the
        spirit's Perception + Compassion. One success is enough to
        sense Essence in the vaguest of measures. Three or more
        successes means the spirit not only senses Essence, but
        knows its source and potential powers (if possessed by
        Exalted, for example).
        &quot;

        Minimum Compassion: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        For each success on the roll, the spirit may improve an
        individual's Stamina by one dot. More dice than the
        spirit's Charisma + Compassion may not be rolled, nor may
        the spirit increase the target's Stamina by more dots than
        the spirit's Essence. Only one use of this Charm may be
        active on an individual at any given time. This Charm
        fades at a rate of one dot per (the spirit's Willpower) turns.
        &quot;

        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The spirit may heal itself or others. Spends the 3
        motes of Essence and make a Compassion roll. If the roll
        succeeds, the Charm heals one health level of bashing or
        lethal damage.

        Sense Domain&lt;br&gt;

        Cost: 5 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Measure the Wind&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm enables the spirit to get a feel for how
        things are going within its domain of influence (up to a half
        mile in diameter per point of Essence, but most often related
        to a geographical feature — for instance, a single tree and a
        little land surrounding it might be a spirit's area of influence).
        Roll the spirit's Perception + Compassion. One
        success allows the spirit to sense the presence of any direct
        and immediate danger (to itself or to the domain) in the
        area. Two successes allow a reasonably thorough catalogue
        of the influences at work in the area and the intentions they
        have with regard to the spirit or its domain. Three or more
        successes allows the spirit to know almost anything currently
        going on within its domain that isn't protected by some sott
        of supernatural ward or misdirection. Charms, sorcery and
        exceptional Ability rolls or stunts may block this insight or
        remove successes, at the Storyteller's discretion. Some spir-
        its that have no natural domain may be able to use this ability
        in any area they've spent several days exploring (Storyteller's
        discretion; two additional successes required).

        Dreamspeak
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes
        Duration: One scene
        Type: Simple
        Minimum Compassion: 1
        Minimum Essence: 2
        Prerequisite Charms: None
        This Charm allows a spirit to speak with the target in
        his dreams. The target must be asleep, and the spirit must
        know approximately where he is, although the spirit need
        not be present there. Roll the spirit's Intelligence + Compassion.
        The more successes the spirit gets, the more easily
        it converses with the dreamer. Four or more successes
        indicates that not only can the spirit appear in the dream,
        but it will seem to be of extreme significance to the dreamer.
        &quot;

    dreamscape[Dreamscape]

        Dreamscape
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 10 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 4&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Dreamspeak&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a spirit to govern the dream of a
        sleeping mortal. It may shape that dream in whatever way
        it wishes, appearing or not appearing in the dream as it
        pleases. Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Compassion. The
        more successes, the more the spirit can manipulate. The
        spirit must know either the approximate location of the
        dreamer or his identity. While the spirit may harm the
        dreamer inside of the dream, no damage carries over to the
        real world.
        &quot;

    natural_prognostication[Natural Prognostication]
    click natural_prognostication callback &quot;
        Natural Prognostication
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 2 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Instant&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        The spirit is naturally in tune with the patterns of
        destiny and the astrological forces. A simple success on a
        Perception + Compassion check causes this spirit's behavior
        (actions, words) to reflect in some small way the path
        of things to come. Most spirits with this Charm don't
        notice themselves using it and would shrug if it was pointed
        out to them; it's simply a part of what they are. The number
        of successes indicates the importance of the event that is
        prognosticated and/or the level of detail provided. The
        words and actions of such spirits are frequently ambiguous
        and often enigmatic.
        &quot;

    foretell_the_future[Foretell the Future]
    natural_prognostication --&gt; foretell_the_future
    click foretell_the_future callback &quot;
        Foretell the Future
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 10 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Variable&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Natural Prognostication&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This spirit may deliberately attempt to foresee what
        may come with a successful Perception + Compassion
        check. The number of successes determines how long it
        takes the spirit to glean the information. The spirit must
        sleep, meditate or in some other way &amp;quot;go within&amp;quot; for one
        day per success. More successes means more information
        means more time spent &amp;quot;under.&amp;quot; This spirit sees what may
        be, not what must be.
        &quot;

    hand_of_destiny[Hand of Destiny]
    foretell_the_future --&gt; hand_of_destiny
    click hand_of_destiny callback &quot;
        Hand of Destiny
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 14 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: Variable&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 6&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Foretell the Future&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a powerful spirit to glimpse the hand
        of Destiny moving behind the curtains of reality, upon a
        successful Perception + Compassion check. The number of
        successes determines how much of Destiny's plan the spirit
        glimpses. It also determines how much of that plan notices the
        spirit. The more the spirit sees, the more the spirit becomes
        caught up in whatever is happening. The spirit may feel
        compelled to take part in the plan, and not necessarily in the
        way it would have chosen. Few spirits will use this Charm
        lightly, and they may require great boons or services in
        return for its use. If the Storyteller chooses, this Charm may
        have the same sleep or meditation requirement as Foretell
        the Future — except that the spirit must go within for at least
        one week for each success. Spirits can spend months dreaming,
        trying to comprehend Destiny's plan.

    landscape_travel[Landscape Travel]

        Landscape Travel
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 4 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a spirit to travel quickly, comfortably
        and easily in its natural element. A forest spirit might
        gain perfect balance and sticky feet to allow it to travel
        easily along tree limbs and jump from tree to tree. A water
        spirit might walk on water, or develop gills and fins if it
        didn't have them already.
        &quot;

    landscape_camouflage[Landscape Camouflage]
    landscape_travel --&gt; landscape_camouflage
    click landscape_camouflage callback &quot;
        Landscape Camouflage
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Landscape Travel&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a spirit to camouflage itself, as long
        as it is within its natural element (a forest spirit must be
        within the trees; an earth spirit could camouflage itself against
        grass, earth, or stone; a fire spirit could camouflage
        itself within or against a fire, or against hot desert sands).
        Roll the spirit's Wits + Compassion. Every success adds
        one to the difficulty of Perception + Awareness checks to
        notice the spirit.
        &quot;

    landscape_hide[Landscape Hide]
    landscape_camouflage --&gt; landscape_hide
    click landscape_hide callback &quot;
        Landscape Hide
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 6 motes, 1 Willpower&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: Landscape Camouflage&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a spirit to hide within a solid piece
        of its natural landscape. A forest spirit might sink into a
        tree trunk; a spirit of the plains might sink into the sound.
        During its time within its element, the spirit's senses are
        muted. Roll the spirit's Stamina + Resistance if the item in
        which it hides suffers any damage. If the roll fails, the spirit
        is forced out of the item. If the roll succeeds, the spirit may
        choose to stay in the item, but it will take any damage that
        the item takes, health level for health level. If the item is
        particularly sturdy, it may add up to five health levels to the
        spirit's rotal, at the Storyteller's discretion — one health
        level per success on the original roll.
        &quot;

    tracking[Tracking]
    click tracking callback &quot;
        Tracking
        &lt;br&gt;
        Cost: 5 motes&lt;br&gt;
        Duration: One scene&lt;br&gt;
        Type: Simple&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Compassion: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 1&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a spirit to track someone or some-
        thing on a successful Perception + Compassion chock.
        One success is all that's needed for a spirit to track a normal
        human in the spirit's natural domain, regardless of the
        prey's Survival skill. More successes are needed if the spirit
        wishes to track an Exalted, another spirit or some other
        supernatural creature capable of supernatural Stealth, or if
        it wishes to track outside of its natural domain. Other
        modifiers (such as familiarity with the prey or weather
        conditions) apply only to tracking beings capable of supernatural
        misdirection — see the rules in the main Exalted book for details.

        Minimum Compassion: 3&lt;br&gt;
        Minimum Essence: 2&lt;br&gt;
        Prerequisite Charms: None&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        Spirits use this Charm to summon food for those who
        need it. The spirit must succeed at a Stamina + Compassion
        check. Each success the spirit achieves allows it to summon
        enough food for a full meal for one person (the spirit may
        choose to summon less than its successes allow it to). For
        five motes, the food summoned is edible. For ten motes, the
        food is some of the finest nourishment ever tasted.

        The effects of this Charm last for one week, and the
        Charm may not be used more than once every other week
        Some possible effects:&lt;br&gt;
        • Four dots to Abilities, distributed as the spirit sees
        fit. This may include Abilities the target does not normally
        possess, unless he is not physically capable of possessing
        them. 1 his may not raise a target s Ability score above six.&lt;br&gt;
        • Two dots to Attributes, distributed as the spirit sees fit.&lt;br&gt;
        • The return of one temporary Willpower point. (The
        target's Willpower may not be raised above his maximum.
        The returned Willpower may be used up normally, but will
        not disappear when the week is over.)&lt;br&gt;
        • The return of ten motes of Essence.&lt;br&gt;
        • The effects of one Charm (maximum Virtue 1,
        Essence 1) that the spirit possesses may be conferred upon
        the target. These effects last no longer than one week.&lt;br&gt;
        • Good luck: the target gains one extra die to add to
        normal Ability checks and to Charm checks.&lt;br&gt;
        • Create a good luck charm, walkaway of other
        talisman of permanent duration.&lt;br&gt;
        • A permanent mark appears on the target in an
        obvious place. This mark can be seen only by spirits and
        Exalted using a sensory Charm that allows them to per-
        ceive Essence at work. While mortals cannot see the mark,
        it obviously alters the character's horoscope and can be
        detected in that fashion. Effects vary, depending on the
        meaning of the mark.&lt;br&gt;

        • Two dots to Abilities, distributed as the spirit sees
        fit, duration permanent. This may include Abilities the
        target does not normally possess, unless he is not physically
        capable of possessing them.&lt;br&gt;
        • One permanent Essence point.&lt;br&gt;
        • The return of all temporary Willpower that the
        target has lost.&lt;br&gt;
        • The effects of one Charm (maximum Virtue 2,
        Essence 2) that the spirit possesses may be conferred upon
        the target. These effects last for as long as the effects of the
        Charm that was conferred would normally last. In rare cases,
        the effect may be permanent (Storyteller's discretion).&lt;br&gt;
        • Good luck: the target's temporary Willpower is
        always one higher than her permanent Willpower. The
        effect is permanent.&lt;br&gt;
        • Create a double- or triple-effect talisman of permanent
        duration.&lt;br&gt;

        Through the use of this Charm, the spirit can create mental
        illusions that only the target can see. To do it, roll the spirit's
        Manipulation + Conviction. The first success creates the illusion,
        while additional successes make the illusion more difficult to
        penetrate. The target's player must make an Intelligence + Temperance
        roll and must gain a number of successes at least equal to
        the number of successes the spirit rolled. If not, the target is unable
        to tell the illusion from reality. He may make additional Intelligence
        + Temperance rolls whenever the illusion departs wildly
        from what the target expects from reality, making believable
        illusions much more difficult to see through. Once the illusion has
        been penetrated, it is dispelled, and all further uses of the Charm
        on that being are at + 1 difficulty for the next several days.

        The spirit channels Essence into the victim to inflame her
        emotional state. One success merely aggravates whatever
        condition is already present, while three or more successes
        cause the target to completely lose herself in the emotion of the
        moment. You may roll no more dice that the spirit's Convic-
        tion. Used against one of the Exalted, this Charm causes the

        The spirit channels Essence into the target to alter his
        emotional state, instilling within him a desire to obey the
        spirit. Roll the spirit's Charisma + Conviction with a
        difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Simple success
        merely makes the target slightly more likely to obey, while
        three successes forces him to obey completely unless such
        obedience would cause him physical harm. At five successes,
        the target does anything the spirit commands.

        This Charm allows a spirit to lay a Geas, or bond, upon
        a target. It requires eye contact and a successful Manipulation
        + Conviction check, with at least three successes,
        The spirit may order the target to perform one task, which
        may include such broad orders as &amp;quot;serve me for one month.&amp;quot;
        The spirit may not order the target to do something that
        would directly harm the target, but it may order him to
        attempt a difficult or dangerous goal as long as there is a
        reasonable chance of success (Storyteller's discretion).
        This Charm has a minimum cost of 15 motes, even if it is
        to last only one day. This Geas does not completely govern
        the target's actions; rather, it gives the target a compulsion
        to work toward the task he has been given. For each day
        that the target fails to work in good faith toward the task,
        he loses one temporary Willpower and takes one health
        level of aggravated damage. For each two days spent
        working in good faith toward the task, he regains one
        health level lost from for disobeying the Geas.

        The target of this Charm finds herself in an illusory
        world of the spirit's design. The illusion is total and covers
        all senses — according to all of her senses, the target has
        been transported elsewhere. The illusion has a nearly
        instant duration but may appear to last tor up to one day to
        the mind of the target.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm requires the spirit to touch its target (a
        nonreflexive Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts roll if she's
        actively evading) or look in her eyes. The spirit may use
        this effect on multiple people at once, but all of them must
        find themselves in the same illusion, and the spirit must
        touch all of them at once.&lt;br&gt;
        Any damage the target takes within the hallucination
        is purely illusory. However, if the target dies within the
        illusion, then her player must succeed on a Stamina +
        Resistance roll or fall into a coma for one day per point of
        the spirit's Essence (or longer, at the Storyteller's discretion,
        if it suits the dramatic needs of the story).

            As the Possession spirit Charm, roll the spirit's Manipulation
            + Conviction against the target's Willpower in a resisted
            action. If the spirit gains more successes than the target has
            temporary Willpower, then the initial possession succeeds. As
            long as the spirit occupies the victim, temporary Willpower
            cannot he regained. The possessing spirit must relinquish con-
            trol of the victims body at least once per week, though it isn't
            necessary to abandon the victim. The spirit must make the
            attempt to regain control of the victim by repeating the initial
            possession roll. After each month of possession, the victim loses
            one point of Willpower permanently. If a spirit fails in its attempt
            to regain control of its victim, the spirit is expelled, and the
            victim cannot be possessed by that spirit again.

            This Charm allows a spirit to possess someone indefinitely,
            riding them as if the host's body were its own
            and laying the groundwork for a true fusion of spirit and
            mortal form. In order for this Charm to work, the potential
            vessel must consent to the spirit's possessing him.
            Otherwise, it does not function and the spirit must rely
            on cruder Charms, such as Soul Rapt. The results of the
            Charm depend on the difference in the Essence of the
            host and the possessing spirit. If the spirit's Essence
            exceeds the host's by three or more, the host acquires the
            spirit's Traits (both Attributes and Abilities). If the
            host's Essence exceeds the spirit's by three or more, the
            spirit acquires the host's Traits. If the Essence of host and
            spirit are within two points of one another, a true fusion
            is achieved in which the combined entity has the average
            of the Traits of both halves, rounded up. The fusion also
            acquires the average of the spirit and the subject's temporary
            Essence after subtracting the 20 motes needed to
            trigger the Charm. If the being is an Exalt, add all
            temporary Essence together before determining the average
            — the result of a god synthesis with an Exalt has only
            Peripheral Essence. In addition, it has access to one of the
            god's Charms per point of total permanent Essence.
            These Charms cannot include Dematerialize.&lt;br&gt;
            This Charm is exceedingly rare outside of Rathess, the
            surrounding regions and other backwaters. Gods and spirits
            hailing from regions close to the Realm generally avoid
            using it, out of fear that the Immaculates would notice and
            take offense. The Immaculate Philosophy's adherents consider
            use of this Charm a grave blasphemy and take harsh
            measures to suppress its continued use. If the host is slain,
            the spirit reforms in one-third the normal time, and the
            spirit will never lose its individual identity as a result. If the
            host is killed using Charms that have the effect of slaying
            a spirit forever (as with Ghost-Eating Technique) the
            spirit and the host's higher soul are both destroyed. Spirits
            using this Charm are not constantly drained the way those
            who simply create bodies for themselves out of Essence
            through the use of the Materialize Charm are.

            This Charm allows a spirit to utterly destroy the soul
            of a being it is riding, thereby creating a host lacking the
            ability to regain control. The spirit rider may then use the
            body as a host at will or vacate it, during which time it
            assumes a comatose state until either the spirit returns or
            the vessel is destroyed. To attempt to use this Charm, the
            spirit must be in contact with the target. Make an extended
            roll of Conviction + Essence against the target's
            Willpower + Essence, one roll per activation of the Charm.
            If the spirit accumulates successes equal to the target's
            Essence, he succeeds, destroying the victim's soul permanently.
            Failing at any point in this process casts out the
            spirit, who may never again attempt to use this Charm
            against the same would-be host.&lt;br&gt;
            A soulless body retains all its Physical Attributes
            (Strength, Dexterity and Stamina), which the spirit may
            either use as they were before hollowing out the soul or
            augment with its own Attributes (if higher). However, its
            Mental and Social Attributes cease to exist. The body now
            uses its spirit rider's Attributes in these areas, as well all of
            its other characteristics (such as Willpower, Essence, Abilities,
            Charms, etc.). Such a body is indeed little more than
            an empty vessel, and the spirit primarily gains the ability
            to manifest in a particular physical form on a permanent
            basis — a valuable ability in some cases.&lt;br&gt;
            A body without a soul lasts only two weeks before it
            begins to show signs of physical corruption, becoming
            useless to the spirit after an additional week. This decay
            may be staved off by the commitment of 2 additional motes
            of Essence per day, each infusion pushing back the start of
            the two-week period. All Essence spent activating the
            Charm remains committed until the host body decays.

        Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction with a
        difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Simple success or
        one extra success indicates that the target is mildly confused.
        He might confuse one direction along a path with
        another. Two or three extra successes indicate that the
        target is quite confused. He might believe that traveling
        after dark in the woods without a lantern is a perfectly
        reasonable thing to do. Four or more extra successes
        indicate that the target is completely addled and may well
        do something very dangerous. He could try to scale a cliff
        face in the dark or go to sleep in a bear's den. Fair Folk are
        immune to this power.

        The spirit must touch its target in order to employ this
        Charm (normal Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts check).
        If successful, roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction
        with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. The more
        successes, the more of the target's memories the spirit
        absorbs. This may temporarily befuddle the target, but
        Memory Mirror does not actually remove the target's
        memories, just duplicates them. With a simple success, the
        spirit obtains only the most basic details: profession, name
        and any major life events. Four or more extra successes
        indicate near-total memor; absorption.

        This Charm works like Memory Mirror, except that
        the memories are drained out of the target as they enter the
        spirit's mind. Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction
        with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. The more
        successes the spirit achieves, the fewer details the target
        remembers, until only the smallest details remain. Four or
        more extra successes indicate that the target suffers from
        near-total amnesia. The memories have actually been
        removed and cannot be recovered through association or
        prompting.

        Prerequisite Charms: Memory Sponge&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm allows a spirit to transfer memories between
        two subjects. The spirit must be able to touch both
        subjects at once, and if they are evading, the spirit must
        succeed on a Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts roll. This
        is not a reflexive attack, and if the spirit is attempting to
        touch both targets in the same turn it activates the Charm,
        split its dice pool at least three ways.
        After the spirit touches the targets, roll its Manipulation
        + Conviction with a difficult equal to the higher of the
        two target's Essences. The memories are moved from one
        subject to another, not copied. The spirit gets a vague idea
        of the shape of the memories - enough to identify blocks
        of them and figure out what should be moved. The spirit
        remembers only vague details afterward, not specifics.
        The more successes on the roll, the more precisely the
        spirit can identify and choose what to move, and the more
        it can move. Simple success allows the movement of a few
        random memories, three successes allows large, important
        memories, and five or more extra successes allow the spirit
        to transfer an entire lifetime's worth of memories, or just a
        single dark and hidden secret. Note that the transfer is one
        way — a spirit that wishes to swap two personalities
        between bodies has to roll five or more extra success on two
        uses of the Charm.

        Duration: Reflexive&lt;br&gt;

        Prerequisite Charms: Dreamscape&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm acts exactly as the Compassion Charm
        Dreamscape, except that the roll made is Manipulation +
        Conviction, and any harm done to the target within the
        dream has a chance of leaking through to the target's physical
        body (as either bashing or lethal damage, as appropriate).&lt;br&gt;
        If the target takes damage in the dream, her player must
        make a reflexive Wits roll to see how much slips through to
        harm the character's real body. For every success on the wits
        roll, one health level is subtracted from the damage that the
        character took in the hallucination before it is applied to her
        real body. The character can never take more damage to her
        real body from a single event in the hallucination than the
        Essence of the spirit that used Dreambane on her.&lt;br&gt;
        Each time damage gets through the soak roll, the
        target's player may make a Willpower roll. With three or
        more successes, the character wakes up. The player must
        also succeed a Willpower roll if the character takes enough
        damage to kill her in the dream before she wakes up. If the
        roll botches, the character dies (if mortal) or enters a coma
        for one week per point of the spirit's Essence (if Exalted).
        If the roll fails, the character wakes up at Incapacitated and
        must heal normally. If the roll succeeds, she wakes up with
        only one additional health level of bashing damage. This
        Charm may only be used on one target at a time.

        The spirit must touch the target for this Charm to

        Arts check). If the attempt to touch the target is successful,
        make a reflexive Wits + Temperance roll. For every success
        the spirit achieves, the target loses two motes of Essence.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through the use of this Charm, the spirit forms mul-
        tiple images of itself to deceive attackers. This ability works
        much like Harrow the Mind, above. However, there are
        more images and they are harder to distinguish from reality.
        Make an Intelligence + Temperance roll for the spirit,
        opposed by the target's Perception + Awareness. If the
        target garners fewer successes than the spirit, he sees many
        false images of the small god, each virtually indistinguishable
        from the real being. Attacks by individuals so befuddled
        have only (their Essence) in 10 chance of actually striking
        the spirit. Make another Perception + Awareness for those
        observing the spirit every time the spirit attacks.

        This Charm allows the spirit to temporarily distract the
        target, causing his attention to focus on something other
        than the spirit. Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Conviction
        with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence. Simple success
        distracts the target for a turn - long enough for the spirit
        to run away or dematerialize. Three or more extra successes
        distract the target from anything it was thinking about the
        spirit, such as suspicions, accusations, anger, etc. Five or
        more extra successes means the target does not remember
        the spirit until something or someone reminds him of what
        he was thinking. This Charm requires extra successes to
        distract a target who is feeling negative emotions toward the
        spirit, and it requires at least three additional success to
        affect someone in combat with it.

        This Charm allows the spirit to camouflage itself within
        whatever environment it happens to be in. A spirit standing
        against a rock takes on the coloration of that rock, and its
        edges might soften a bit, making its outline difficult to make
        out against the background. Roll the spirit's Wits + Temperance.
        Successes on this roll are added to any successes on the
        spirit's Dexterity + Stealth roll if it is attempting to actively
        hide. The result is the number of successes observers' players
        must roll on their Wits + Temperance checks (four net
        successes are required if the spirit is still, three if it moves
        slowly, two if it moves normally, and one if it moves quickly).

        matter for Storyteller discretion. The more tense and
        hurried the situation, the more successes the spirit requires.
        One success is all that's needed in a relaxed, quiet
        setting. Five successes take the spirit home even in the
        middle of a combat.

        through the opening. With one success, the portal takes
        the travelers to a random (though not immediately harmful)
        location. With two successes, the spirit may loosely
        direct the exit point (&amp;quot;Southern Deserts, please&amp;quot;) or go
        directly to its home. Five or more successes allow the spirit
        to direct the portal wherever it pleases. Extra successes

        After the spirit touches the target, roll its Wits+ Temperance.
        For each success, the spirit devours one mote of
        Essence. This Charm always involves some other method
        of sustenance as well. The spirit might feed on the dreams
        and nightmares of the mortal, or on her breath. Whatever
        the spirit feeds on does not harm the mortal, although it
        might have mild (and temporary) effects when the mortal

        devours something that leaves the mortal impaired in some
        way — hearing, sight, etc. — although it leaves the body
        apparently unharmed. Only supernatural healing of some
        sort restores the loss; it never heals normally. Even if the
        spirit does not replenish the Essence it spent, it feels satiated.

            The small god summons up the forces of the elements or
            similar powers to protect it from harm. The spirit gains armor
            equal to Temperance + Essence. This armor can be used to
            soak any form of bashing or lethal damage, including damage
            caused by environmental conditions such as excessive heat
            or cold. Elementals and elementally associated spirits always
            surround themselves with elemental protections such as a
            hauberk of tough roots, a shirt of flexible rock or a breastplate
            of living flame. Other spirits don armor of light or darkness
            or, occasionally, transform their ordinary garb into supernally
            beautiful and durable garments of pure magic.

            The spirit has consensual sex with a mortal in order to
            activate the Charm, so no Brawl or Martial Arts rolls are
            required. Amidst the merriment, roll the spirit's Manipulation
            + Temperance. For each success, the spirit devours 1 mote of
            Essence. What is more, the victim later develops an unquenchable
            craving for another rendezvous with the spirit. If
            the victim returns freely, the process is repeated (and any lost
            Wits suffered from the process below are regained). If the
            victim does not return within one week, roll his Wits +
            Conviction -1 die for each time the spirit successfully used the
            Charm against die victim. If the roll yields fewer successes that
            the spirit's Willpower, the victim loses a point of Wits temporarily.
            If he does not return to the spirit that day, repeat the
            process the next day, continuing every day until the victim
            either returns of his own volition, succeeds in breaking the
            Charm or reaches 0 Wits (in which case the victim loses all
            control and will do anything within his power to return to the
            spirit). If the victim's Wits + Conviction roll succeeds against
            the spirit s Willpower, the Charm is cancelled, and all temporary
            Wits losses are regained. This Charm has no effect on
            beings with an Essence higher than the spirit's.

            The Shade Tiger possesses a unique Charm — it
            can hide in any shadow for the duration of the day.
            The Den of Shadows automatically disappears at
            sunset (and the Tiger springs forth from its lair, ready
            to hunt). While in the Den of Shadows, the Shade
            Tiger is Elsewhere and is, therefore, unaware of any
            happenings in the living world or the Underworld.

        The spirit must touch its target for this Charm to
        work, requiring a successful Dexterity + Brawl or Martial
        Arts roll. If the touch attempt is successful, make a
        reflexive Valor + Essence roll for the spirit. For every
        success on the attack, the spirit does a point of lethal
        damage. The character's armor soak applies as normal to
        this damage, and extra successes on the attack roll add to
        damage as usual.&lt;br&gt;
        This Charm may rely on heat, cold, life-draining or
        any number of other mechanisms to do damage —
        almost all have secondary effects that the spirit can
        manipulate to its advantage. For example, a ghost that
        can start fires with its fiery touch can burn down a barn
        with this Charm.

        &lt;br&gt;
        Through the use of this Charm, the spirit can materialize
        in the physical world. The cost of this Charm is between 50
        percent and 100 percent of the spirit's temporary Essence.
        The cost varies from spirit to spirit and is listed in the spirit's
        description or assigned by the Storyteller. Generally, as the
        power of the spirit grows, the spirit must expend proportionally
        greater amounts of Essence to materialize.
        In most cases, a spirit that plans to meddle in mortal
        affairs will materialize in some safe area and then rest,
        regaining its Essence, before it goes about its business. Spirits
        that have not materialized cannot affect the physical world, not
        with Charms, physical attacks or in any other fashion.

        When the spirit uses this Charm, it gains a pool of extra
        actions equal to its Valor. Actions in this pool can be expended
        for extra attacks on the spirit's initiative or reflexively, to parry or
        dodge an attack or to refresh the spirit's Dodge pool when using
        the full dodge maneuver. If the spirit does not use all the actions
        in its pool, they remain available for it in the following turn.
        Actions in the pool will persist for many months, and many spirits
        make sure they retain a full complement of actions in case they
        are ambushed. A spirit cannot use this Charm again until it has
        used up all the extra actions granted by the last use of the Charm.
        While the spirit has extra actions in its pool, the motes of Essence
        used to power this Charm are considered committed.

        The spirit may intone blasphemies, keen out the lamentations
        of the dead or speak the victim's true name, but
        regardless, its words are like a battering ram. The spirit attacks
        using Charisma + Valor to hit the opponent and does bashing
        damage equal to the spirit's Strength, which can be soaked
        only by the target's Stamina. Extra successes on the attack add
        to damage, as usual. For every health level of damage the
        target takes, he is at a - 1 penalty to all dice pools for a number
        of turns equal to the attacking spirit's Essence.
        This attack may be dodged or blocked as normal but
        has no physical effects except perhaps causing blood to
        flow from the target's ears or hurling him bodily through
        light obstructions.

        Spirits use the Details Charm to change small details of
        their physical appearance, upon a successful Charisma +
        Valor check. Each use of this Charm allows one discrete
        detail to be changed. The size and complexity of the detail
        depends on the number of successes the spirit achieves. One
        or two successes allow a small detail to be changed: hair
        length, the shape of the spirit's pupils. Three or four allow
        the spirit to change larger details: the design of a dress, the
        length of its limbs. Five or more successes allow the spirit to
        create details from nothing: a bracelet where there was none.

        The spirit may take on another's physical form upon a
        successful Charisma + Valor check. This requires the spirit
        to touch the being to be emulated, which may require a
        successful Dexterity + Brawl or Martial Arts check, depending
        on the circumstances. The spirit must pay in advance
        and choose up front how many motes to spend; if it chooses
        to break the Charm early, those motes are not recovered.
        A very successful Perception + Awareness check may
        see through the disguise. Four successes indicate that small
        elements of the disguise seem wrong, while five or more
        indicate that the shapechanging seems patently false.
        Some spirits and Exalted may possess Charms designed to
        see through such trickery.&lt;br&gt;
        Certain actions may allow someone to see through
        such a disguise or may momentarily break through the
        disguise; superstitions of various areas prescribe different
        actions. Some of these are: looking at someone's reflection
        in a fractured mirror, looking at someone through lenses
        that have been soaked in a special herbal solution, blowing
        ashes of certain types of wood into someone's face. Which
        superstitions apply depends on the spirit. Some particularly
        difficult &amp;quot;rituals&amp;quot; may break the disguise entirely.

        The spirit may take on any physical form it wishes upon
        a successful Charisma + Valor check; it must pay the cost for
        the full duration in advance (if the spirit breaks the Charm
        early, the extra motes are not recovered). After that, the
        spirit must reactivate the Charm if it wishes to continue the
        masquerade, making the Charisma + Valor check again.
        The spirit must spend another 10 motes and a Willpower
        point in advance (once per use of the Charm, not per day)
        if it wishes its Abilities, Attributes, etc. to change with its
        form. This latter restriction does not apply if the spirit has
        a very limited number of forms and knows them very well.&lt;br&gt;
        The Shapechange Charm may be seen through in the
        same manner as the Form Match Charm, above.

        The spirit may cause the same manifestations as Will-o-Wisp,

        time, however, it may create distinct patterns. Ghostly
        writing may be created. This Charm may be used to hold
        a conversation with a target while the spirit is unmanifested.
        The number of successes affects how distinct the manifestations
        are, how precisely controlled they are, and just how
        thoroughly the spirit may manipulate its medium. With
        five successes, the spirit may paint simple scenes out of
        light, sound and smell. These scenes may not be larger than
        ten feet in any direction, and they are obvious to anyone
        who is close enough to observe them.

        target, roll its Strength + Valor with a difficulty equal to

        The spirit may use this Charm to affect whichever
        element (s) it shares an affinity with. For example, a forest
        spirit could affect Wood, and possibly Earth (Storyteller's
        discretion). This allows spirits to cause or calm small floods
        and rainstorms, twist a small torch into a raging inferno or
        a delicate dance of firelight, create gusts of wind, open a
        hole in the earth or twist tree limbs into manacles.&lt;br&gt;
        Roll the spirit's Manipulation + Valor. The number of
        successes indicates how fine a level of control the spirit has
        and how powerful an effect it can create. One success
        allows a spirit to call forth a mild rain or light a campfire,
        while three allow a spirit to cause a rainy day or build a
        torch into a bonfire without any extra fuel. Five successes
        might allow a spirit to create a phantom lover out of air
        itself or instantly consume a large wooden structure in
        flames. The spirit may manipulate a one-yard cube of an
        element per point of Essence it possess. In the case of area
        effects like rain, it could cause the effect in a five-meter
        radius per permanent Essence point.

        This Charm allows the spirit to control the weather.
        Note that this may duplicate some effects of the Element
        Control Charms, but its effects are limited to weather
        phenomena: rain, fog, floods, storms, heat, cold, etc. This
        charm affects a larger area as well — a one- mile radius per
        permanent Essence point. Roll the spirit's Manipulation +
        Valor; the number of successes determines the size of the
        effect the spirit can create, and the length of time before the
        area's natural climate reasserts itself. One success allows
        small changes — a low wind could be created, or a heavy
        wind could be downgraded to a moderate wind. Three
        successes allow the creation of a moderate rainstorm or a
        mild heat wave. Five successes allow wild changes in local
        weather patterns, such as high heat in the middle of the
        month of Ascending Water. It takes one hour per success
        for the local weather patterns to reassert themselves. Unnatural
        or one-time meteorological effects that are halted by
        the use of this Charm can be considered ended.

        check, set fire to whatever item it touches. This requires 5
        motes if the item is nonflammable.

        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm causes its target to become &amp;quot;touched&amp;quot; by
        the spirit's element. The spirit must touch its target for this
        Charm to work, possibly requiring a successful Dexterity +
        Brawl or Martial Arts attack. Roll the spirit's Manipulation
        + Valor with a difficulty equal to the target's Essence.
        The more extra successes, the more intense the target's
        reaction to this Charm. A Fire-aspected spirit causes
        someone to grow feverish. The target might take on some
        of the personality traits associated with fire: a hotheaded
        temper, lusty libido, curiosity, anger, vengeance, forceful-
        ness or willfulness. The effects of this Charm last for one
        day or until the spirit chooses to release the target, whichever
        comes sooner. This Charm is a favorite among demons,
        who use it to bring out the worst in targets.

        This Charm is the same as Element Touch, but it lasts
        for one week or until the spirit chooses to release the target,
        whichever comes sooner. Like Element Touch, this Charm
        requires the spirit to touch its target. If the spirit achieves
        three or more successes, the target may have hallucinations
        that support and intensify his reaction.

        Prerequisite Charms: Element Kiss&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;br&gt;
        This Charm is similar to the lesser Element Kiss and
        Element Touch Charms, but lasts for one month or until
        the spirit chooses to release the target (whichever comes
        sooner). Like the two lesser Charms, the spirit must either
        touch the target or look into the target's eyes. Roll the
        spirit's Manipulation + Valor with a difficulty equal to the
        target's Essence. With two or more successes, the target has
        the hallucinations described under Element Kiss. At three
        or more successes, the target may well harm herself under
        the force of her reaction.

            from a single blow with a weapon to a single performance or
            even to the roll to create a single piece of fine jewelry. When
            used for longer endeavors, this Charm adds dice to each roll

            items or to perform feats of inhuman skill with various crafts.
            When using this charm, roll Intelligence + Valor for the spirit.
            Every success gained on this roll can be added to a single Craft,
            Medicine, Occult or Larceny roll designed to create an item or to
            carry out a slow and careful process such as performing surgery,
            compounding a drug, putting on a disguise or creating a magical
            talisman. This Charm cannot be used to enhance any task that
            requires speed or haste such as picking a lock before the guard
            arrives, stopping someone from bleeding to death or any form of
            combat. It can also only be used on tasks that require both clear
